    He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee.

    The price of his sale shall be according to the number of years;
    he shall be with him according to the time of a hired servant.

    # Leviticus 25:51
    If there are yet many years,
    according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.

    # Leviticus 25:52
    If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee,
    then he shall reckon with him;
    according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.

    As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him.

    He shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.

    If you walk in my statutes and keep my commandments,

    Your threshing shall continue until the vintage,
    and the vintage shall continue until the sowing time.

    You shall eat your bread to the full,

    # Leviticus 26:06
    I will give peace in the land,

    I will have respect for you,
    make you fruitful,
    multiply you,
    and will establish my covenant with you.

    # Leviticus 26:10
    You shall eat old supplies long kept,
    and you shall move out the old because of the new.

    and if your soul abhors my ordinances,
    so that you will not do all my commandments,
    but break my covenant,

    # Leviticus 26:16
    I also will do this to you:
    I will appoint terror over you,
    even consumption and fever,
    that shall consume the eyes,
    and make the soul to pine away.

    You will sow your seed in vain,
    for your enemies will eat it.

    # Leviticus 26:17
    I will set my face against you,
    and you will be struck before your enemies.

    Those who hate you will rule over you;
    and you will flee when no one pursues you.

    # Leviticus 26:18
    If you in spite of these things will not listen to me,
    then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.

    # Leviticus 26:19
    I will break the pride of your power,
    and I will make your sky like iron,
    and your soil like bronze.

    # Leviticus 26:20
    Your strength will be spent in vain;
    for your land won't yield its increase,
    neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit.

    # Leviticus 26:21
    If you walk contrary to me,
    and won't listen to me,
    then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.

    # Leviticus 26:22
    I will send the wild animals among you,
    which will rob you of your children,
    destroy your livestock,
    and make you few in number.

    Your roads will become desolate.

    # Leviticus 26:23
    If by these things you won't be turned back to me,
    but will walk contrary to me,

    # Leviticus 26:24
    then I will also walk contrary to you;
    and I will strike you,
    even I,
    seven times for your sins.

    # Leviticus 26:25
    I will bring a sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant.

    You will be gathered together within your cities,
    and I will send the pestilence among you.

    You will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

    # Leviticus 26:26
    When I break your staff of bread,
    ten women shall bake your bread in one oven,
    and they shall deliver your bread again by weight.

    You shall eat,
    and not be satisfied.

    When a man consecrates a person to Yahweh in a vow,
    according to your valuation,

    your valuation of a male
    from 20 years old to 60 years old
    shall be 50 shekels of silver,

    If the person is from a month old to 5 years old,

    If the person is from 60 years old and upward;

    But if he is poorer than your valuation,

    If it is an animal of which men offer an offering to Yahweh,

    # Leviticus 27:10
    He shall not alter it,
    nor exchange it,
    a good for a bad,
    or a bad for a good.

    If he shall at all exchange animal for animal,
    then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.

    If it is any unclean animal,
    of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh,
    then he shall set the animal before the priest;

    and the priest shall evaluate it,
    whether it is good or bad.

    As the priest evaluates it,
    so it shall be.

    then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.

    When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh,
    then the priest shall evaluate it,
    whether it is good or bad.

    As the priest evaluates it,

    and it shall be his.

    If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession,
    then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it.

    The sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.

    # Leviticus 27:17
    If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee,
    according to your valuation it shall stand.

    If he will not redeem the field,
    or if he has sold the field to another man,
    it shall not be redeemed any more;
    # Leviticus 27:21
    but the field,
    when it goes out in the Jubilee,
    shall be holy to Yahweh,
    as a devoted field.

    It shall be owned by the priests.

    # Leviticus 27:22
    If he dedicates a field to Yahweh which he has bought,
    which is not of the field of his possession,

    # Leviticus 27:23
    then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee;

    as a holy thing to Yahweh.

    In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought,

    However the firstborn among animals,
    which belongs to Yahweh as a firstborn,

    no devoted thing that a man devotes to Yahweh of all that he has,
