# Section: Now these are the names of the sons of Israel
# Exodus 01:01
STARTHERE

Now these are the names of the sons of Israel,
who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):

# Exodus 01:02
Reuben,
Simeon,
Levi,
and Judah,

# Exodus 01:03
Issachar,
Zebulun,
and Benjamin,

# Exodus 01:04
Dan and Naphtali,
Gad and Asher.

# Exodus 01:05
All the souls who came out of Jacob's body were seventy souls,
and Joseph was in Egypt already.

# Exodus 01:06
Joseph died,
as did all his brothers,
and all that generation.

# Exodus 01:07
The children of Israel were fruitful,
and increased abundantly,
and multiplied,
and grew exceedingly mighty;
and the land was filled with them.

# Exodus 01:08
Now there arose a new king over Egypt,
who didn't know Joseph.

# Exodus 01:09
He said to his people,
``Behold,
the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.

# Exodus 01:10
Come,
let's deal wisely with them,
lest they multiply,
and it happen that when any war breaks out,
they also join themselves to our enemies and fight against us,
and escape out of the land.''

# Exodus 01:11
Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens.

They built storage cities for Pharaoh:
Pithom and Raamses.

# Exodus 01:12
But the more they afflicted them,
the more they multiplied and the more they spread out.

They started to dread the children of Israel.

# Exodus 01:13
The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,

# Exodus 01:14
and they made their lives bitter with hard service in mortar and in brick,
and in all kinds of service in the field,
all their service,
in which they ruthlessly made them serve.

# Exodus 01:15
The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives,
of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah,
and the name of the other Puah,

# Exodus 01:16
and he said,
``When you perform the duty of a midwife to the Hebrew women,
and see them on the birth stool,
if it is a son,
then you shall kill him;
but if it is a daughter,
then she shall live.''

# Exodus 01:17
But the midwives feared God,
and didn't do what the king of Egypt commanded them,
but saved the baby boys alive.

# Exodus 01:18
The king of Egypt called for the midwives,
and said to them,
``Why have you done this thing and saved the boys alive?''

# Exodus 01:19
The midwives said to Pharaoh,
``Because the Hebrew women aren't like the Egyptian women;
for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife comes to them.''

# Exodus 01:20
God dealt well with the midwives,
and the people multiplied,
and grew very mighty.

# Exodus 01:21
Because the midwives feared God,
he gave them families.

# Exodus 01:22
Pharaoh commanded all his people,
saying,
``You shall cast every son who is born into the river,
and every daughter you shall save alive.''

# Exodus 01:23
Exodus.

# Exodus 02:01
A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi as his wife.

# Exodus 02:02
The woman conceived and bore a son.

When she saw that he was a fine child,
she hid him three months.

# Exodus 02:03
When she could no longer hide him,
she took a papyrus basket for him,
and coated it with tar and with pitch.

She put the child in it,
and laid it in the reeds by the river's bank.

# Exodus 02:04
His sister stood far off,
to see what would be done to him.

# Exodus 02:05
Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the river.

Her maidens walked along by the riverside.

She saw the basket among the reeds,
and sent her servant to get it.

# Exodus 02:06
She opened it,
and saw the child,
and behold,
the baby cried.

She had compassion on him,
and said,
``This is one of the Hebrews’ children.''

# Exodus 02:07
Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter,
``Should I go and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women,
that she may nurse the child for you?''

# Exodus 02:08
Pharaoh's daughter said to her,
``Go.''

The young woman went and called the child's mother.

# Exodus 02:09
Pharaoh's daughter said to her,
``Take this child away,
and nurse him for me,
and I will give you your wages.''

The woman took the child,
and nursed it.

# Exodus 02:10
The child grew,
and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter,
and he became her son.

She named him Moses,
and said,
``Because I drew him out of the water.''

# Exodus 02:11
In those days,
when Moses had grown up,
he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens.

He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew,
one of his brothers.

# Exodus 02:12
He looked this way and that way,
and when he saw that there was no one,
he killed the Egyptian,
and hid him in the sand.

# Exodus 02:13
He went out the second day,
and behold,
two men of the Hebrews were fighting with each other.

He said to him who did the wrong,
``Why do you strike your fellow?''

# Exodus 02:14
He said,
``Who made you a prince and a judge over us?

Do you plan to kill me,
as you killed the Egyptian?''

Moses was afraid,
and said,
``Surely this thing is known.''

# Exodus 02:15
Now when Pharaoh heard this thing,
he sought to kill Moses.

But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh,
and lived in the land of Midian,
and he sat down by a well.

# Exodus 02:16
Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters.

They came and drew water,
and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.

# Exodus 02:17
The shepherds came and drove them away;
but Moses stood up and helped them,
and watered their flock.

# Exodus 02:18
When they came to Reuel,
their father,
he said,
``How is it that you have returned so early today?''

# Exodus 02:19
They said,
``An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds,
and moreover he drew water for us,
and watered the flock.''

# Exodus 02:20
He said to his daughters,
``Where is he?

Why is it that you have left the man?

Call him,
that he may eat bread.''

# Exodus 02:21
Moses was content to dwell with the man.

He gave Moses Zipporah,
his daughter.

# Exodus 02:22
She bore a son,
and he named him Gershom,
for he said,
``I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land.''

# Exodus 02:23
In the course of those many days,
the king of Egypt died,
and the children of Israel sighed because of the bondage,
and they cried,
and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.

# Exodus 02:24
God heard their groaning,
and God remembered his covenant with Abraham,
with Isaac,
and with Jacob.

# Exodus 02:25
God saw the children of Israel,
and God understood.

# Exodus 02:26
Exodus.

# Exodus 03:01
Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro,
his father-in-law,
the priest of Midian,
and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness,
and came to God's mountain,
to Horeb.

# Exodus 03:02
Yahweh's angel appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the middle of a bush.

He looked,
and behold,
the bush burned with fire,
and the bush was not consumed.

# Exodus 03:03
Moses said,
``I will go now,
and see this great sight,
why the bush is not burned.''

# Exodus 03:04
When Yahweh saw that he came over to see,
God called to him out of the middle of the bush,
and said,
``Moses!

Moses!''

He said,
``Here I am.''

# Exodus 03:05
He said,
``Don't come close.

Take off your sandals,
for the place you are standing on is holy ground.''

# Exodus 03:06
Moreover he said,
``I am the God of your father,
the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob.''

Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.

# Exodus 03:07
Yahweh said,
``I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt,
and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters,
for I know their sorrows.

# Exodus 03:08
I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,
and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land,
to a land flowing with milk and honey;
to the place of the Canaanite,
the Hittite,
the Amorite,
the Perizzite,
the Hivite,
and the Jebusite.

# Exodus 03:09
Now,
behold,
the cry of the children of Israel has come to me.

Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.

# Exodus 03:10
Come now therefore,
and I will send you to Pharaoh,
that you may bring my people,
the children of Israel,
out of Egypt.''

# Exodus 03:11
Moses said to God,
``Who am I,
that I should go to Pharaoh,
and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?''

# Exodus 03:12
He said,
``Certainly I will be with you.

This will be the token to you,
that I have sent you:
when you have brought the people out of Egypt,
you shall serve God on this mountain.''

# Exodus 03:13
Moses said to God,
``Behold,
when I come to the children of Israel,
and tell them,
‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me,
‘What is his name?’ what should I tell them?''

# Exodus 03:14
God said to Moses,
``I AM WHO I AM,'' and he said,
``You shall tell the children of Israel this:
‘I AM has sent me to you.’''

# Exodus 03:15
God said moreover to Moses,
``You shall tell the children of Israel this,
‘Yahweh,
the God of your fathers,
the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob,
has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever,
and this is my memorial to all generations.

# Exodus 03:16
Go and gather the elders of Israel together,
and tell them,
‘Yahweh,
the God of your fathers,
the God of Abraham,
of Isaac,
and of Jacob,
has appeared to me,
saying,
``I have surely visited you,
and seen that which is done to you in Egypt.

# Exodus 03:17
I have said,
I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite,
the Hittite,
the Amorite,
the Perizzite,
the Hivite,
and the Jebusite,
to a land flowing with milk and honey.''’

# Exodus 03:18
They will listen to your voice.

You shall come,
you and the elders of Israel,
to the king of Egypt,
and you shall tell him,
‘Yahweh,
the God of the Hebrews,
has met with us.

Now please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness,
that we may sacrifice to Yahweh,
our God.’

# Exodus 03:19
I know that the king of Egypt won't give you permission to go,
no,
not by a mighty hand.

# Exodus 03:20
I will reach out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders which I will do among them,
and after that he will let you go.

# Exodus 03:21
I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,
and it will happen that when you go,
you shall not go empty-handed.

# Exodus 03:22
But every woman shall ask of her neighbor,
and of her who visits her house,
jewels of silver,
jewels of gold,
and clothing.

You shall put them on your sons,
and on your daughters.

You shall plunder the Egyptians.''

# Exodus 03:23
Exodus.

# Exodus 04:01
Moses answered,
``But,
behold,
they will not believe me,
nor listen to my voice;
for they will say,
‘Yahweh has not appeared to you.’''

# Exodus 04:02
Yahweh said to him,
``What is that in your hand?''

He said,
``A rod.''

# Exodus 04:03
He said,
``Throw it on the ground.''

He threw it on the ground,
and it became a snake;
and Moses ran away from it.

# Exodus 04:04
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Stretch out your hand,
and take it by the tail.''

He stretched out his hand,
and took hold of it,
and it became a rod in his hand.

# Exodus 04:05
``This is so that they may believe that Yahweh,
the God of their fathers,
the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob,
has appeared to you.''

# Exodus 04:06
Yahweh said furthermore to him,
``Now put your hand inside your cloak.''

He put his hand inside his cloak,
and when he took it out,
behold,
his hand was leprous,
as white as snow.

# Exodus 04:07
He said,
``Put your hand inside your cloak again.''

He put his hand inside his cloak again,
and when he took it out of his cloak,
behold,
it had turned again as his other flesh.

# Exodus 04:08
``It will happen,
if they will not believe you or listen to the voice of the first sign,
that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

# Exodus 04:09
It will happen,
if they will not believe even these two signs or listen to your voice,
that you shall take of the water of the river,
and pour it on the dry land.

The water which you take out of the river will become blood on the dry land.''

# Exodus 04:10
Moses said to Yahweh,
``O Lord,
I am not eloquent,
neither before now,
nor since you have spoken to your servant;
for I am slow of speech,
and of a slow tongue.''

# Exodus 04:11
Yahweh said to him,
``Who made man's mouth?

Or who makes one mute,
or deaf,
or seeing,
or blind?

Isn't it I,
Yahweh?

# Exodus 04:12
Now therefore go,
and I will be with your mouth,
and teach you what you shall speak.''

# Exodus 04:13
Moses said,
``Oh,
Lord,
please send someone else.''

# Exodus 04:14
Yahweh's anger burned against Moses,
and he said,
``What about Aaron,
your brother,
the Levite?

I know that he can speak well.

Also,
behold,
he is coming out to meet you.

When he sees you,
he will be glad in his heart.

# Exodus 04:15
You shall speak to him,
and put the words in his mouth.

I will be with your mouth,
and with his mouth,
and will teach you what you shall do.

# Exodus 04:16
He will be your spokesman to the people.

It will happen that he will be to you a mouth,
and you will be to him as God.

# Exodus 04:17
You shall take this rod in your hand,
with which you shall do the signs.''

# Exodus 04:18
Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law,
and said to him,
``Please let me go and return to my brothers who are in Egypt,
and see whether they are still alive.''

Jethro said to Moses,
``Go in peace.''

# Exodus 04:19
Yahweh said to Moses in Midian,
``Go,
return into Egypt;
for all the men who sought your life are dead.''

# Exodus 04:20
Moses took his wife and his sons,
and set them on a donkey,
and he returned to the land of Egypt.

Moses took God's rod in his hand.

# Exodus 04:21
Yahweh said to Moses,
``When you go back into Egypt,
see that you do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand,
but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.

# Exodus 04:22
You shall tell Pharaoh,
‘Yahweh says,
Israel is my son,
my firstborn,

# Exodus 04:23
and I have said to you,
``Let my son go,
that he may serve me;'' and you have refused to let him go.

Behold,
I will kill your firstborn son.’''

# Exodus 04:24
On the way at a lodging place,
Yahweh met Moses and wanted to kill him.

# Exodus 04:25
Then Zipporah took a flint,
and cut off the foreskin of her son,
and cast it at his feet;
and she said,
``Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.''

# Exodus 04:26
So he let him alone.

Then she said,
``You are a bridegroom of blood,'' because of the circumcision.

# Exodus 04:27
Yahweh said to Aaron,
``Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.''

He went,
and met him on God's mountain,
and kissed him.

# Exodus 04:28
Moses told Aaron all Yahweh's words with which he had sent him,
and all the signs with which he had instructed him.

# Exodus 04:29
Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.

# Exodus 04:30
Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses,
and did the signs in the sight of the people.

# Exodus 04:31
The people believed,
and when they heard that Yahweh had visited the children of Israel,
and that he had seen their affliction,
then they bowed their heads and worshiped.

# Exodus 04:32
Exodus.

# Exodus 05:01
Afterward Moses and Aaron came,
and said to Pharaoh,
``This is what Yahweh,
the God of Israel,
says,
‘Let my people go,
that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.’''

# Exodus 05:02
Pharaoh said,
``Who is Yahweh,
that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go?

I don't know Yahweh,
and moreover I will not let Israel go.''

# Exodus 05:03
They said,
``The God of the Hebrews has met with us.

Please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness,
and sacrifice to Yahweh,
our God,
lest he fall on us with pestilence,
or with the sword.''

# Exodus 05:04
The king of Egypt said to them,
``Why do you,
Moses and Aaron,
take the people from their work?

Get back to your burdens!''

# Exodus 05:05
Pharaoh said,
``Behold,
the people of the land are now many,
and you make them rest from their burdens.''

# Exodus 05:06
The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their officers,
saying,

# Exodus 05:07
``You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick,
as before.

Let them go and gather straw for themselves.

# Exodus 05:08
You shall require from them the number of the bricks which they made before.

You shall not diminish anything of it,
for they are idle.

Therefore they cry,
saying,
‘Let's go and sacrifice to our God.’

# Exodus 05:09
Let heavier work be laid on the men,
that they may labor in it.

Don't let them pay any attention to lying words.''

# Exodus 05:10
The taskmasters of the people went out with their officers,
and they spoke to the people,
saying,
``This is what Pharaoh says:
‘I will not give you straw.

# Exodus 05:11
Go yourselves,
get straw where you can find it,
for nothing of your work shall be diminished.’''

# Exodus 05:12
So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.

# Exodus 05:13
The taskmasters were urgent saying,
``Fulfill your work quota daily,
as when there was straw!''

# Exodus 05:14
The officers of the children of Israel,
whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them,
were beaten,
and were asked,
``Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today,
in making brick as before?''

# Exodus 05:15
Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh,
saying,
``Why do you deal this way with your servants?

# Exodus 05:16
No straw is given to your servants,
and they tell us,
‘Make brick!’ and behold,
your servants are beaten;
but the fault is in your own people.''

# Exodus 05:17
But Pharaoh said,
``You are idle!

You are idle!

Therefore you say,
‘Let's go and sacrifice to Yahweh.’

# Exodus 05:18
Go therefore now,
and work;
for no straw shall be given to you;
yet you shall deliver the same number of bricks!''

# Exodus 05:19
The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble when it was said,
``You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!''

# Exodus 05:20
They met Moses and Aaron,
who stood along the way,
as they came out from Pharaoh.

# Exodus 05:21
They said to them,
``May Yahweh look at you and judge,
because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh,
and in the eyes of his servants,
to put a sword in their hand to kill us!''

# Exodus 05:22
Moses returned to Yahweh,
and said,
``Lord,
why have you brought trouble on this people?

Why is it that you have sent me?

# Exodus 05:23
For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name,
he has brought trouble on this people.

You have not rescued your people at all!''

# Exodus 05:24
Exodus.

# Exodus 06:01
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh,
for by a strong hand he shall let them go,
and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.''

# Exodus 06:02
God spoke to Moses,
and said to him,
``I am Yahweh.

# Exodus 06:03
I appeared to Abraham,
to Isaac,
and to Jacob,
as God Almighty;
but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them.

# Exodus 06:04
I have also established my covenant with them,
to give them the land of Canaan,
the land of their travels,
in which they lived as aliens.

# Exodus 06:05
Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
whom the Egyptians keep in bondage,
and I have remembered my covenant.

# Exodus 06:06
Therefore tell the children of Israel,
‘I am Yahweh,
and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
and I will rid you out of their bondage,
and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm,
and with great judgments.

# Exodus 06:07
I will take you to myself for a people.

I will be your God;
and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God,
who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

# Exodus 06:08
I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham,
to Isaac,
and to Jacob;
and I will give it to you for a heritage:
I am Yahweh.’''

# Exodus 06:09
Moses spoke so to the children of Israel,
but they didn't listen to Moses for anguish of spirit,
and for cruel bondage.

# Exodus 06:10
Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,

# Exodus 06:11
``Go in,
speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt,
that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.''

# Exodus 06:12
Moses spoke before Yahweh,
saying,
``Behold,
the children of Israel haven't listened to me.

How then shall Pharaoh listen to me,
when I have uncircumcised lips?''

# Exodus 06:13
Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron,
and gave them a command to the children of Israel,
and to Pharaoh king of Egypt,
to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.

# Exodus 07:02
You shall speak all that I command you;
and Aaron your brother shall speak to Pharaoh,
that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.

# Exodus 07:03
I will harden Pharaoh's heart,
and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 07:04
But Pharaoh will not listen to you,
so I will lay my hand on Egypt,
and bring out my armies,
my people the children of Israel,
out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

# Exodus 07:05

and it will become a serpent.’''

Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh,
and they did so,
as Yahweh had commanded.

Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants,
and it became a serpent.

# Exodus 07:11
Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers.

They also,
the magicians of Egypt,
did the same thing with their enchantments.

# Exodus 07:12
For they each cast down their rods,
and they became serpents;
but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

# Exodus 07:13
Pharaoh's heart was hardened,
and he didn't listen to them,
as Yahweh had spoken.

# Exodus 07:14
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Pharaoh's heart is stubborn.

He refuses to let the people go.

# Exodus 07:15
Go to Pharaoh in the morning.

Behold,
he is going out to the water.

You shall stand by the river's bank to meet him.

You shall take the rod which was turned to a serpent in your hand.

# Exodus 07:16
You shall tell him,
‘Yahweh,
the God of the Hebrews,
has sent me to you,
saying,
``Let my people go,
that they may serve me in the wilderness.

Behold,
until now you haven't listened.''

# Exodus 07:17
Yahweh says,
``In this you shall know that I am Yahweh.

Behold:
I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters which are in the river,
and they shall be turned to blood.

# Exodus 07:18
The fish that are in the river will die and the river will become foul.

The Egyptians will loathe to drink water from the river.''’''

# Exodus 07:19
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Tell Aaron,
‘Take your rod,
and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt,
over their rivers,
over their streams,
and over their pools,
and over all their ponds of water,
that they may become blood.

There will be blood throughout all the land of Egypt,
both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.’''

# Exodus 07:20
Moses and Aaron did so,
as Yahweh commanded;
and he lifted up the rod,
and struck the waters that were in the river,
in the sight of Pharaoh,
and in the sight of his servants;
and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.

# Exodus 07:21
The fish that were in the river died.

The river became foul.

The Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river.

The blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 07:22
The magicians of Egypt did the same thing with their enchantments.

So Pharaoh's heart was hardened,
and he didn't listen to them,
as Yahweh had spoken.

# Exodus 07:23
Pharaoh turned and went into his house,
and he didn't even take this to heart.

# Exodus 07:24
All the Egyptians dug around the river for water to drink;
for they couldn't drink the river water.

# Exodus 07:25
Seven days were fulfilled,
after Yahweh had struck the river.

# Exodus 07:26
Exodus.

# Exodus 08:01
Yahweh spoke to Moses,
``Go in to Pharaoh,
and tell him,
‘This is what Yahweh says,
``Let my people go,
that they may serve me.

# Exodus 08:02
If you refuse to let them go,
behold,
I will plague all your borders with frogs.

# Exodus 08:03
The river will swarm with frogs,
which will go up and come into your house,
and into your bedroom,
and on your bed,
and into the house of your servants,
and on your people,
and into your ovens,
and into your kneading troughs.

# Exodus 08:04
The frogs shall come up both on you,
and on your people,
and on all your servants.''’''

# Exodus 08:05
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Tell Aaron,
‘Stretch out your hand with your rod over the rivers,
over the streams,
and over the pools,
and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.’''

# Exodus 08:06
Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;
and the frogs came up,
and covered the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 08:07
The magicians did the same thing with their enchantments,
and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 08:08
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron,
and said,
``Entreat Yahweh,
that he take away the frogs from me and from my people;
and I will let the people go,
that they may sacrifice to Yahweh.''

# Exodus 08:09
Moses said to Pharaoh,
``I give you the honor of setting the time that I should pray for you,
and for your servants,
and for your people,
that the frogs be destroyed from you and your houses,
and remain in the river only.''

# Exodus 08:10
Pharaoh said,
``Tomorrow.''

Moses said,
``Let it be according to your word,
that you may know that there is no one like Yahweh our God.

# Exodus 08:11
The frogs shall depart from you,
and from your houses,
and from your servants,
and from your people.

They shall remain in the river only.''

# Exodus 08:12
Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh,
and Moses cried to Yahweh concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh.

# Exodus 08:13
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses,
and the frogs died out of the houses,
out of the courts,
and out of the fields.

# Exodus 08:14
They gathered them together in heaps,
and the land stank.

# Exodus 08:15
But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite,
he hardened his heart,
and didn't listen to them,
as Yahweh had spoken.

# Exodus 08:16
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Tell Aaron,
‘Stretch out your rod,
and strike the dust of the earth,
that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.’''

# Exodus 08:17
They did so;
and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,
and struck the dust of the earth,
and there were lice on man,
and on animal;
all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 08:18
The magicians tried with their enchantments to produce lice,
but they couldn't.

There were lice on man,
and on animal.

# Exodus 08:19
Then the magicians said to Pharaoh,
``This is God's finger;'' but Pharaoh's heart was hardened,
and he didn't listen to them,
as Yahweh had spoken.

# Exodus 08:20
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Rise up early in the morning,
and stand before Pharaoh;
behold,
he comes out to the water;
and tell him,
‘This is what Yahweh says,
``Let my people go,
that they may serve me.

# Exodus 08:21
Else,
if you will not let my people go,
behold,
I will send swarms of flies on you,
and on your servants,
and on your people,
and into your houses.

The houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies,
and also the ground they are on.

# Exodus 08:22
I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen,
in which my people dwell,
that no swarms of flies shall be there,
to the end you may know that I am Yahweh on the earth.

# Exodus 08:23
I will put a division between my people and your people.

This sign shall happen by tomorrow.''’''

# Exodus 08:24
Yahweh did so;
and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh,
and into his servants’ houses.

In all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.

# Exodus 08:25
Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron,
and said,
``Go,
sacrifice to your God in the land!''

# Exodus 08:26
Moses said,
``It isn't appropriate to do so;
for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God.

Behold,
if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes,
won't they stone us?

# Exodus 08:27
We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness,
and sacrifice to Yahweh our God,
as he shall command us.''

# Exodus 08:28
Pharaoh said,
``I will let you go,
that you may sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness,
only you shall not go very far away.

Pray for me.''

# Exodus 08:29
Moses said,
``Behold,
I am going out from you.

I will pray to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,
from his servants,
and from his people,
tomorrow;
only don't let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh.''

# Exodus 08:30
Moses went out from Pharaoh,
and prayed to Yahweh.

# Exodus 08:31
Yahweh did according to the word of Moses,
and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh,
from his servants,
and from his people.

There remained not one.

# Exodus 08:32
Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also,
and he didn't let the people go.

# Exodus 08:33
Exodus.

# Exodus 09:01
Then Yahweh said to Moses,
``Go in to Pharaoh,
and tell him,
‘This is what Yahweh,
the God of the Hebrews,
says:
``Let my people go,
that they may serve me.

# Exodus 09:02
For if you refuse to let them go,
and hold them still,

# Exodus 09:03
behold,
Yahweh's hand is on your livestock which are in the field,
on the horses,
on the donkeys,
on the camels,
on the herds,
and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.

# Exodus 09:04
Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt;
and nothing shall die of all that belongs to the children of Israel.''’''

# Exodus 09:05
Yahweh appointed a set time,
saying,
``Tomorrow Yahweh shall do this thing in the land.''

# Exodus 09:06
Yahweh did that thing on the next day;
and all the livestock of Egypt died,
but of the livestock of the children of Israel,
not one died.

# Exodus 09:07
Pharaoh sent,
and,
behold,
there was not so much as one of the livestock of the Israelites dead.

But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn,
and he didn't let the people go.

# Exodus 09:08
Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron,
``Take handfuls of ashes of the furnace,
and let Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.

# Exodus 09:09
It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt,
and shall be boils and blisters breaking out on man and on animal,
throughout all the land of Egypt.''

# Exodus 09:10
They took ashes of the furnace,
and stood before Pharaoh;
and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky;
and it became boils and blisters breaking out on man and on animal.

# Exodus 09:11
The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils;
for the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians.

# Exodus 09:12
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh,
and he didn't listen to them,
as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.

# Exodus 09:13
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Rise up early in the morning,
and stand before Pharaoh,
and tell him,
‘This is what Yahweh,
the God of the Hebrews,
says:
``Let my people go,
that they may serve me.

# Exodus 09:14
For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart,
against your officials,
and against your people;
that you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth.

# Exodus 09:15
For now I would have stretched out my hand,
and struck you and your people with pestilence,
and you would have been cut off from the earth;

# Exodus 09:16
but indeed for this cause I have made you stand:
to show you my power,
and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth,

# Exodus 09:17
because you still exalt yourself against my people,
that you won't let them go.

# Exodus 09:18
Behold,
tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail,
such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.

# Exodus 09:19
Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all that you have in the field be brought into shelter.

The hail will come down on every man and animal that is found in the field,
and isn't brought home,
and they will die.''’''

# Exodus 09:20
Those who feared Yahweh's word among the servants of Pharaoh made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.

# Exodus 09:21
Whoever didn't respect Yahweh's word left his servants and his livestock in the field.

# Exodus 09:22
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Stretch out your hand toward the sky,
that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt,
on man,
and on animal,
and on every herb of the field,
throughout the land of Egypt.''

# Exodus 09:23
Moses stretched out his rod toward the heavens,
and Yahweh sent thunder and hail;
and lightning flashed down to the earth.

Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 09:24
So there was very severe hail,
and lightning mixed with the hail,
such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

# Exodus 09:25
The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field,
both man and animal;
and the hail struck every herb of the field,
and broke every tree of the field.

# Exodus 09:26
Only in the land of Goshen,
where the children of Israel were,
there was no hail.

# Exodus 09:27
Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron,
and said to them,
``I have sinned this time.

Yahweh is righteous,
and I and my people are wicked.

# Exodus 09:28
Pray to Yahweh;
for there has been enough of mighty thunderings and hail.

I will let you go,
and you shall stay no longer.''

# Exodus 09:29
Moses said to him,
``As soon as I have gone out of the city,
I will spread out my hands to Yahweh.

The thunders shall cease,
and there will not be any more hail;
that you may know that the earth is Yahweh's.

# Exodus 09:30
But as for you and your servants,
I know that you don't yet fear Yahweh God.''

# Exodus 09:31
The flax and the barley were struck,
for the barley had ripened and the flax was blooming.

# Exodus 09:32
But the wheat and the spelt were not struck,
for they had not grown up.

# Exodus 09:33
Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh,
and spread out his hands to Yahweh;
and the thunders and hail ceased,
and the rain was not poured on the earth.

# Exodus 09:34
When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased,
he sinned yet more,
and hardened his heart,
he and his servants.

# Exodus 09:35
The heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
and he didn't let the children of Israel go,
just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses.

# Exodus 09:36
Exodus.

# Exodus 10:01
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Go in to Pharaoh,
for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants,
that I may show these my signs among them;

# Exodus 10:02
and that you may tell in the hearing of your son,
and of your son's son,
what things I have done to Egypt,
and my signs which I have done among them;
that you may know that I am Yahweh.''

# Exodus 10:03
Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh,
and said to him,
``This is what Yahweh,
the God of the Hebrews,
says:
‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me?

Let my people go,
that they may serve me.

# Exodus 10:04
Or else,
if you refuse to let my people go,
behold,
tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country,

# Exodus 10:05
and they shall cover the surface of the earth,
so that one won't be able to see the earth.

They shall eat the residue of that which has escaped,
which remains to you from the hail,
and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.

# Exodus 10:06
Your houses shall be filled,
and the houses of all your servants,
and the houses of all the Egyptians,
as neither your fathers nor your fathers’ fathers have seen,
since the day that they were on the earth to this day.’'' He turned,
and went out from Pharaoh.

# Exodus 10:07
Pharaoh's servants said to him,
``How long will this man be a snare to us?

Let the men go,
that they may serve Yahweh,
their God.

Don't you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?''

# Exodus 10:08
Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh,
and he said to them,
``Go,
serve Yahweh your God;
but who are those who will go?''

# Exodus 10:09
Moses said,
``We will go with our young and with our old.

We will go with our sons and with our daughters,
with our flocks and with our herds;
for we must hold a feast to Yahweh.''

# Exodus 10:10
He said to them,
``Yahweh be with you if I let you go with your little ones!

See,
evil is clearly before your faces.

# Exodus 10:11
Not so!

Go now you who are men,
and serve Yahweh;
for that is what you desire!''

Then they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

# Exodus 10:12
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts,
that they may come up on the land of Egypt,
and eat every herb of the land,
even all that the hail has left.''

# Exodus 10:13
Moses stretched out his rod over the land of Egypt,
and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day,
and all night;
and when it was morning,
the east wind brought the locusts.

# Exodus 10:14
The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt,
and rested in all the borders of Egypt.

They were very grievous.

Before them there were no such locusts as they,
nor will there ever be again.

# Exodus 10:15
For they covered the surface of the whole earth,
so that the land was darkened,
and they ate every herb of the land,
and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left.

There remained nothing green,
either tree or herb of the field,
through all the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 10:16
Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste,
and he said,
``I have sinned against Yahweh your God,
and against you.

# Exodus 10:17
Now therefore please forgive my sin again,
and pray to Yahweh your God,
that he may also take away from me this death.''

# Exodus 10:18
Moses went out from Pharaoh,
and prayed to Yahweh.

# Exodus 10:19
Yahweh sent an exceedingly strong west wind,
which took up the locusts,
and drove them into the Red Sea.

There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.

# Exodus 10:20
But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart,
and he didn't let the children of Israel go.

# Exodus 10:21
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Stretch out your hand toward the sky,
that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt,
even darkness which may be felt.''

# Exodus 10:22
Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky,
and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days.

# Exodus 10:23
They didn't see one another,
and nobody rose from his place for three days;
but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.

# Exodus 10:24
Pharaoh called to Moses,
and said,
``Go,
serve Yahweh.

Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind.

Let your little ones also go with you.''

# Exodus 10:25
Moses said,
``You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt offerings,
that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.

# Exodus 10:26
Our livestock also shall go with us.

Not a hoof shall be left behind,
for of it we must take to serve Yahweh our God;
and we don't know with what we must serve Yahweh,
until we come there.''

# Exodus 10:27
But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart,
and he wouldn't let them go.

# Exodus 10:28
Pharaoh said to him,
``Get away from me!

Be careful to see my face no more;
for in the day you see my face you shall die!''

# Exodus 10:29
Moses said,
``You have spoken well.

I will see your face again no more.''

# Exodus 10:30
Exodus.

# Exodus 11:01
Yahweh said to Moses,
``I will bring yet one more plague on Pharaoh,
and on Egypt;
afterwards he will let you go.

When he lets you go,
he will surely thrust you out altogether.

# Exodus 11:02
Speak now in the ears of the people,
and let every man ask of his neighbor,
and every woman of her neighbor,
jewels of silver,
and jewels of gold.''

# Exodus 11:03
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.

Moreover,
the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt,
in the sight of Pharaoh's servants,
and in the sight of the people.

# Exodus 11:04
Moses said,
``This is what Yahweh says:
‘About midnight I will go out into the middle of Egypt,

# Exodus 11:05
and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die,
from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne,
even to the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill,
and all the firstborn of livestock.

# Exodus 11:06
There will be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,
such as there has not been,
nor will be any more.

# Exodus 11:07
But against any of the children of Israel a dog won't even bark or move its tongue,
against man or animal,
that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.

# Exodus 11:08
All these servants of yours will come down to me,
and bow down themselves to me,
saying,
``Get out,
with all the people who follow you;'' and after that I will go out.’'' He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.

# Exodus 11:09
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Pharaoh won't listen to you,
that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.''

# Exodus 11:10
Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh,
but Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart,
and he didn't let the children of Israel go out of his land.

# Exodus 11:11
Exodus.

# Exodus 12:01
Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,
saying,

# Exodus 12:02
``This month shall be to you the beginning of months.

It shall be the first month of the year to you.

# Exodus 12:03
Speak to all the congregation of Israel,
saying,
‘On the tenth day of this month,
they shall take to them every man a lamb,
according to their fathers’ houses,
a lamb for a household;

# Exodus 12:04
and if the household is too little for a lamb,
then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one according to the number of the souls.

You shall make your count for the lamb according to what everyone can eat.

# Exodus 12:05
Your lamb shall be without defect,
a male a year old.

You shall take it from the sheep or from the goats.

# Exodus 12:06
You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month;
and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at evening.

# Exodus 12:07
They shall take some of the blood,
and put it on the two door posts and on the lintel,
on the houses in which they shall eat it.

# Exodus 12:08
They shall eat the meat in that night,
roasted with fire,
with unleavened bread.

They shall eat it with bitter herbs.

# Exodus 12:09
Don't eat it raw,
nor boiled at all with water,
but roasted with fire;
with its head,
its legs and its inner parts.

# Exodus 12:10
You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning;
but that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn with fire.

# Exodus 12:11
This is how you shall eat it:
with your belt on your waist,
your sandals on your feet,
and your staff in your hand;
and you shall eat it in haste:
it is Yahweh's Passover.

# Exodus 12:12
For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night,
and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
both man and animal.

I will execute judgments against all the gods of Egypt.

I am Yahweh.

# Exodus 12:13
The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are.

When I see the blood,
I will pass over you,
and no plague will be on you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 12:14
This day shall be a memorial for you.

You shall keep it as a feast to Yahweh.

You shall keep it as a feast throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.

# Exodus 12:15
``‘Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread;
even the first day you shall put away yeast out of your houses,
for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day,
that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

# Exodus 12:16
In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation,
and in the seventh day a holy convocation;
no kind of work shall be done in them,
except that which every man must eat,
only that may be done by you.

# Exodus 12:17
You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread;
for in this same day I have brought your armies out of the land of Egypt.

Therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance forever.

# Exodus 12:18
In the first month,
on the fourteenth day of the month at evening,
you shall eat unleavened bread,
until the twenty first day of the month at evening.

# Exodus 12:19
There shall be no yeast found in your houses for seven days,
for whoever eats that which is leavened,
that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel,
whether he is a foreigner,
or one who is born in the land.

# Exodus 12:20
You shall eat nothing leavened.

In all your habitations you shall eat unleavened bread.’''

# Exodus 12:21
Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel,
and said to them,
``Draw out,
and take lambs according to your families,
and kill the Passover.

# Exodus 12:22
You shall take a bunch of hyssop,
and dip it in the blood that is in the basin,
and strike the lintel and the two door posts with the blood that is in the basin.

None of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.

# Exodus 12:23
For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians;
and when he sees the blood on the lintel,
and on the two door posts,
Yahweh will pass over the door,
and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your houses to strike you.

# Exodus 12:24
You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever.

# Exodus 12:25
It shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh will give you,
as he has promised,
that you shall keep this service.

# Exodus 12:26
It will happen,
when your children ask you,
‘What do you mean by this service?’

# Exodus 12:27
that you shall say,
‘It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover,
who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
when he struck the Egyptians,
and spared our houses.’'' The people bowed their heads and worshiped.

# Exodus 12:28
The children of Israel went and did so;
as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron,
so they did.

# Exodus 12:29
At midnight,
Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon,
and all the firstborn of livestock.

# Exodus 12:30
Pharaoh rose up in the night,
he,
and all his servants,
and all the Egyptians;
and there was a great cry in Egypt,
for there was not a house where there was not one dead.

# Exodus 12:31
He called for Moses and Aaron by night,
and said,
``Rise up,
get out from among my people,
both you and the children of Israel;
and go,
serve Yahweh,
as you have said!

# Exodus 12:32
Take both your flocks and your herds,
as you have said,
and be gone;
and bless me also!''

# Exodus 12:33
The Egyptians were urgent with the people,
to send them out of the land in haste,
for they said,
``We are all dead men.''

# Exodus 12:34
The people took their dough before it was leavened,
their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.

# Exodus 12:35
The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver,
and jewels of gold,
and clothing.

# Exodus 12:36
Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,
so that they let them have what they asked.

They plundered the Egyptians.

# Exodus 12:37
The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth,
about six hundred thousand on foot who were men,
in addition to children.

# Exodus 12:38
A mixed multitude went up also with them,
with flocks,
herds,
and even very much livestock.

# Exodus 12:39
They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt;
for it wasn't leavened,
because they were thrust out of Egypt,
and couldn't wait,
and they had not prepared any food for themselves.

# Exodus 12:40
Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred thirty years.

# Exodus 12:41
At the end of four hundred thirty years,
to the day,
all of Yahweh's armies went out from the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 12:42
It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt.

This is that night of Yahweh,
to be much observed by all the children of Israel throughout their generations.

# Exodus 12:43
Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron,
``This is the ordinance of the Passover.

No foreigner shall eat of it,

# Exodus 12:44
but every man's servant who is bought for money,
when you have circumcised him,
then shall he eat of it.

# Exodus 12:45
A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.

# Exodus 12:46
It must be eaten in one house.

You shall not carry any of the meat outside of the house.

Do not break any of its bones.

# Exodus 12:47
All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

# Exodus 12:48
When a stranger lives as a foreigner with you,
and would like to keep the Passover to Yahweh,
let all his males be circumcised,
and then let him come near and keep it.

He shall be as one who is born in the land;
but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.

# Exodus 12:49
One law shall be to him who is born at home,
and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you.''

# Exodus 12:50
All the children of Israel did so.

As Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron,
so they did.

# Exodus 12:51
That same day,
Yahweh brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

# Exodus 12:52
Exodus.

# Exodus 13:01
Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,

# Exodus 13:02
``Sanctify to me all the firstborn,
whatever opens the womb among the children of Israel,
both of man and of animal.

It is mine.''

# Exodus 13:03
Moses said to the people,
``Remember this day,
in which you came out of Egypt,
out of the house of bondage;
for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place.

No leavened bread shall be eaten.

# Exodus 13:04
Today you go out in the month Abib.

# Exodus 13:05
It shall be,
when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanite,
and the Hittite,
and the Amorite,
and the Hivite,
and the Jebusite,
which he swore to your fathers to give you,
a land flowing with milk and honey,
that you shall keep this service in this month.

# Exodus 13:06
Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread,
and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh.

# Exodus 13:07
Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days;
and no leavened bread shall be seen with you.

No yeast shall be seen with you,
within all your borders.

# Exodus 13:08
You shall tell your son in that day,
saying,
‘It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came out of Egypt.’

# Exodus 13:09
It shall be for a sign to you on your hand,
and for a memorial between your eyes,
that Yahweh's law may be in your mouth;
for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt.

# Exodus 13:10
You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.

# Exodus 13:11
``It shall be,
when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanite,
as he swore to you and to your fathers,
and will give it you,

# Exodus 13:12
that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb,
and every firstborn that comes from an animal which you have.

The males shall be Yahweh's.

# Exodus 13:13
Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb;
and if you will not redeem it,
then you shall break its neck;
and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons.

# Exodus 13:14
It shall be,
when your son asks you in time to come,
saying,
‘What is this?’ that you shall tell him,
‘By strength of hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt,
from the house of bondage.

# Exodus 13:15
When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go,
Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
both the firstborn of man,
and the firstborn of livestock.

Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb,
being males;
but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.’

# Exodus 13:16
It shall be for a sign on your hand,
and for symbols between your eyes;
for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us out of Egypt.''

# Exodus 13:17
When Pharaoh had let the people go,
God didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines,
although that was near;
for God said,
``Lest perhaps the people change their minds when they see war,
and they return to Egypt'';

# Exodus 13:18
but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea;
and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 13:19
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him,
for he had made the children of Israel swear,
saying,
``God will surely visit you,
and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you.''

# Exodus 13:20
They took their journey from Succoth,
and encamped in Etham,
in the edge of the wilderness.

# Exodus 13:21
Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud,
to lead them on their way,
and by night in a pillar of fire,
to give them light,
that they might go by day and by night:

# Exodus 13:22
the pillar of cloud by day,
and the pillar of fire by night,
didn't depart from before the people.

# Exodus 13:23
Exodus.

# Exodus 14:01
Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,

# Exodus 14:02
``Speak to the children of Israel,
that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth,
between Migdol and the sea,
before Baal Zephon.

You shall encamp opposite it by the sea.

# Exodus 14:03
Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel,
‘They are entangled in the land.

The wilderness has shut them in.’

# Exodus 14:04
I will harden Pharaoh's heart,
and he will follow after them;
and I will get honor over Pharaoh,
and over all his armies;
and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh.''

They did so.

# Exodus 14:05
The king of Egypt was told that the people had fled;
and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed toward the people,
and they said,
``What is this we have done,
that we have let Israel go from serving us?''

# Exodus 14:06
He prepared his chariot,
and took his army with him;

# Exodus 14:07
and he took six hundred chosen chariots,
and all the chariots of Egypt,
with captains over all of them.

# Exodus 14:08
Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt,
and he pursued the children of Israel;
for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.

# Exodus 14:09
The Egyptians pursued them.

All the horses and chariots of Pharaoh,
his horsemen,
and his army overtook them encamping by the sea,
beside Pihahiroth,
before Baal Zephon.

# Exodus 14:10
When Pharaoh came near,
the children of Israel lifted up their eyes,
and behold,
the Egyptians were marching after them;
and they were very afraid.

The children of Israel cried out to Yahweh.

# Exodus 14:11
They said to Moses,
``Because there were no graves in Egypt,
have you taken us away to die in the wilderness?

Why have you treated us this way,
to bring us out of Egypt?

# Exodus 14:12
Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt,
saying,
‘Leave us alone,
that we may serve the Egyptians?’ For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.''

# Exodus 14:13
Moses said to the people,
``Don't be afraid.

Stand still,
and see the salvation of Yahweh,
which he will work for you today;
for you will never again see the Egyptians whom you have seen today.

# Exodus 14:14
Yahweh will fight for you,
and you shall be still.''

# Exodus 14:15
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Why do you cry to me?

Speak to the children of Israel,
that they go forward.

# Exodus 14:16
Lift up your rod,
and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it.

Then the children of Israel shall go into the middle of the sea on dry ground.

# Exodus 14:17
Behold,
I myself will harden the hearts of the Egyptians,
and they will go in after them.

I will get myself honor over Pharaoh,
and over all his armies,
over his chariots,
and over his horsemen.

# Exodus 14:18
The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh when I have gotten myself honor over Pharaoh,
over his chariots,
and over his horsemen.''

# Exodus 14:19
The angel of God,
who went before the camp of Israel,
moved and went behind them;
and the pillar of cloud moved from before them,
and stood behind them.

# Exodus 14:20
It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel.

There was the cloud and the darkness,
yet it gave light by night.

One didn't come near the other all night.

# Exodus 14:21
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,
and Yahweh caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all night,
and made the sea dry land,
and the waters were divided.

# Exodus 14:22
The children of Israel went into the middle of the sea on the dry ground;
and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.

# Exodus 14:23
The Egyptians pursued,
and went in after them into the middle of the sea:
all of Pharaoh's horses,
his chariots,
and his horsemen.

# Exodus 14:24
In the morning watch,
Yahweh looked out on the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud,
and confused the Egyptian army.

# Exodus 14:25
He took off their chariot wheels,
and they drove them heavily;
so that the Egyptians said,
``Let's flee from the face of Israel,
for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!''

# Exodus 14:26
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Stretch out your hand over the sea,
that the waters may come again on the Egyptians,
on their chariots,
and on their horsemen.''

# Exodus 14:27
Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,
and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared;
and the Egyptians fled against it.

Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.

# Exodus 14:28
The waters returned,
and covered the chariots and the horsemen,
even all Pharaoh's army that went in after them into the sea.

There remained not so much as one of them.

# Exodus 14:29
But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea,
and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.

# Exodus 14:30
Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;
and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

# Exodus 14:31
Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians,
and the people feared Yahweh;
and they believed in Yahweh and in his servant Moses.

# Exodus 14:32
Exodus.

# Exodus 15:01
Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh,
and said,
``I will sing to Yahweh,
for he has triumphed gloriously.

He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.

# Exodus 15:02
Yah is my strength and song.

He has become my salvation.

This is my God,
and I will praise him;
my father's God,
and I will exalt him.

# Exodus 15:03
Yahweh is a man of war.

Yahweh is his name.

# Exodus 15:04
He has cast Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea.

His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.

# Exodus 15:05
The deeps cover them.

They went down into the depths like a stone.

# Exodus 15:06
Your right hand,
Yahweh,
is glorious in power.

Your right hand,
Yahweh,
dashes the enemy in pieces.

# Exodus 15:07
In the greatness of your excellency,
you overthrow those who rise up against you.

You send out your wrath.

It consumes them as stubble.

# Exodus 15:08
With the blast of your nostrils,
the waters were piled up.

The floods stood upright as a heap.

The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.

# Exodus 15:09
The enemy said,
‘I will pursue.

I will overtake.

I will divide the plunder.

My desire will be satisfied on them.

I will draw my sword.

My hand will destroy them.’

# Exodus 15:10
You blew with your wind.

The sea covered them.

They sank like lead in the mighty waters.

# Exodus 15:11
Who is like you,
Yahweh,
among the gods?

Who is like you,
glorious in holiness,
fearful in praises,
doing wonders?

# Exodus 15:12
You stretched out your right hand.

The earth swallowed them.

# Exodus 15:13
``You,
in your loving kindness,
have led the people that you have redeemed.

You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.

# Exodus 15:14
The peoples have heard.

They tremble.

Pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia.

# Exodus 15:15
Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed.

Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab.

All the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away.

# Exodus 15:16
Terror and dread falls on them.

By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone,
until your people pass over,
Yahweh,
until the people you have purchased pass over.

# Exodus 15:17
You will bring them in,
and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance,
the place,
Yahweh,
which you have made for yourself to dwell in:
the sanctuary,
Lord,
which your hands have established.

# Exodus 15:18
Yahweh will reign forever and ever.''

# Exodus 15:19
For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea,
and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them;
but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.

# Exodus 15:20
Miriam the prophetess,
the sister of Aaron,
took a tambourine in her hand;
and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.

# Exodus 15:21
Miriam answered them,
``Sing to Yahweh,
for he has triumphed gloriously.

He has thrown the horse and his rider into the sea.''

# Exodus 15:22
Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea,
and they went out into the wilderness of Shur;
and they went three days in the wilderness,
and found no water.

# Exodus 15:23
When they came to Marah,
they couldn't drink from the waters of Marah,
for they were bitter.

Therefore its name was called Marah.

# Exodus 15:24
The people murmured against Moses,
saying,
``What shall we drink?''

# Exodus 15:25
Then he cried to Yahweh.

Yahweh showed him a tree,
and he threw it into the waters,
and the waters were made sweet.

There he made a statute and an ordinance for them,
and there he tested them.

# Exodus 15:26
He said,
``If you will diligently listen to Yahweh your God's voice,
and will do that which is right in his eyes,
and will pay attention to his commandments,
and keep all his statutes,
I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians;
for I am Yahweh who heals you.''

# Exodus 15:27
They came to Elim,
where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees.

They encamped there by the waters.

# Exodus 15:28
Exodus.

# Exodus 16:01
They took their journey from Elim,
and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin,
which is between Elim and Sinai,
on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 16:02
The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;

# Exodus 16:03
and the children of Israel said to them,
``We wish that we had died by Yahweh's hand in the land of Egypt,
when we sat by the meat pots,
when we ate our fill of bread,
for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.''

# Exodus 16:04
Then Yahweh said to Moses,
``Behold,
I will rain bread from the sky for you,
and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day,
that I may test them,
whether they will walk in my law or not.

# Exodus 16:05
It shall come to pass on the sixth day,
that they shall prepare that which they bring in,
and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.''

# Exodus 16:06
Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel,
``At evening,
you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from the land of Egypt.

# Exodus 16:07
In the morning,
you shall see Yahweh's glory;
because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh.

Who are we,
that you murmur against us?''

# Exodus 16:08
Moses said,
``Now Yahweh will give you meat to eat in the evening,
and in the morning bread to satisfy you,
because Yahweh hears your murmurings which you murmur against him.

And who are we?

Your murmurings are not against us,
but against Yahweh.''

# Exodus 16:09
Moses said to Aaron,
``Tell all the congregation of the children of Israel,
‘Come close to Yahweh,
for he has heard your murmurings.’''

# Exodus 16:10
As Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel,
they looked toward the wilderness,
and behold,
Yahweh's glory appeared in the cloud.

# Exodus 16:11
Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,

# Exodus 16:12
``I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.

Speak to them,
saying,
‘At evening you shall eat meat,
and in the morning you shall be filled with bread.

Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God.’''

# Exodus 16:13
In the evening,
quail came up and covered the camp;
and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.

# Exodus 16:14
When the dew that lay had gone,
behold,
on the surface of the wilderness was a small round thing,
small as the frost on the ground.

# Exodus 16:15
When the children of Israel saw it,
they said to one another,
``What is it?''

For they didn't know what it was.

Moses said to them,
``It is the bread which Yahweh has given you to eat.

# Exodus 16:16
This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded:
‘Gather of it everyone according to his eating;
an omer a head,
according to the number of your persons,
you shall take it,
every man for those who are in his tent.’''

# Exodus 16:17
The children of Israel did so,
and some gathered more,
some less.

# Exodus 16:18
When they measured it with an omer,
he who gathered much had nothing over,
and he who gathered little had no lack.

They each gathered according to his eating.

# Exodus 16:19
Moses said to them,
``Let no one leave of it until the morning.''

# Exodus 16:20
Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses,
but some of them left of it until the morning,
so it bred worms and became foul;
and Moses was angry with them.

# Exodus 16:21
They gathered it morning by morning,
everyone according to his eating.

When the sun grew hot,
it melted.

# Exodus 16:22
On the sixth day,
they gathered twice as much bread,
two omers for each one;
and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.

# Exodus 16:23
He said to them,
``This is that which Yahweh has spoken,
‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest,
a holy Sabbath to Yahweh.

Bake that which you want to bake,
and boil that which you want to boil;
and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.’''

# Exodus 16:24
They laid it up until the morning,
as Moses ordered,
and it didn't become foul,
and there were no worms in it.

# Exodus 16:25
Moses said,
``Eat that today,
for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh.

Today you shall not find it in the field.

# Exodus 16:26
Six days you shall gather it,
but on the seventh day is the Sabbath.

In it there shall be none.''

# Exodus 16:27
On the seventh day,
some of the people went out to gather,
and they found none.

# Exodus 16:28
Yahweh said to Moses,
``How long do you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?

# Exodus 16:29
Behold,
because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath,
therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days.

Everyone stay in his place.

Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.''

# Exodus 16:30
So the people rested on the seventh day.

# Exodus 16:31
The house of Israel called its name
``
Manna'',
and it was like coriander seed,
white;
and its taste was like wafers with honey.

# Exodus 16:32
Moses said,
``This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded,
‘Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations,
that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness,
when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’''

# Exodus 16:33
Moses said to Aaron,
``Take a pot,
and put an omer-full of manna in it,
and lay it up before Yahweh,
to be kept throughout your generations.''

# Exodus 16:34
As Yahweh commanded Moses,
so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony,
to be kept.

# Exodus 16:35
The children of Israel ate the manna forty years,
until they came to an inhabited land.

They ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.

# Exodus 16:36
Now an omer is one tenth of an ephah.

# Exodus 16:37
Exodus.

# Exodus 17:01
All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled from the wilderness of Sin,
starting according to Yahweh's commandment,
and encamped in Rephidim;
but there was no water for the people to drink.

# Exodus 17:02
Therefore the people quarreled with Moses,
and said,
``Give us water to drink.''

Moses said to them,
``Why do you quarrel with me?

Why do you test Yahweh?''

# Exodus 17:03
The people were thirsty for water there;
so the people murmured against Moses,
and said,
``Why have you brought us up out of Egypt,
to kill us,
our children,
and our livestock with thirst?''

# Exodus 17:04
Moses cried to Yahweh,
saying,
``What shall I do with these people?

They are almost ready to stone me.''

# Exodus 17:05
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Walk on before the people,
and take the elders of Israel with you,
and take the rod in your hand with which you struck the Nile,
and go.

# Exodus 17:06
Behold,
I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb.

You shall strike the rock,
and water will come out of it,
that the people may drink.''

Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.

# Exodus 17:07
He called the name of the place Massah,
and Meribah,
because the children of Israel quarreled,
and because they tested Yahweh,
saying,
``Is Yahweh among us,
or not?''

# Exodus 17:08
Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

# Exodus 17:09
Moses said to Joshua,
{
  Choose men for us,
  and go out to fight with Amalek.

  Tomorrow
  I will stand
  on the top of the hill
  with God's rod in my hand.
}

# Exodus 17:10
So Joshua did as Moses had told him,
and fought with Amalek;
and Moses,
Aaron,
and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

# Exodus 17:11
When Moses held up his hand,
Israel prevailed.

When he let down his hand,
Amalek prevailed.

# Exodus 17:12
But Moses’ hands were heavy;
so they took a stone,
and put it under him,
and he sat on it.

Aaron and Hur held up his hands,
the one on the one side,
and the other on the other side.

His hands were steady until sunset.

# Exodus 17:13
Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

# Exodus 17:14
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Write this for a memorial in a book,
and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua:
that I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky.''

# Exodus 17:15
Moses built an altar,
and called its name
``
Yahweh our Banner''.

# Exodus 17:16
He said,
``Yah has sworn:
‘Yahweh will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.’''

# Exodus 17:17
Exodus.

# Exodus 18:01
Now Jethro,
the priest of Midian,
Moses’ father-in-law,
heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people,
how Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.

# Exodus 18:02
Jethro,
Moses’ father-in-law,
received Zipporah,
Moses’ wife,
after he had sent her away,

# Exodus 18:03
and her two sons.

The name of one son was Gershom,
for Moses said,
``I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land''.

# Exodus 18:04
The name of the other was Eliezer,
for he said,
``My father's God was my help and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword.''

# Exodus 18:05
Jethro,
Moses’ father-in-law,
came with Moses’ sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped,
at the Mountain of God.

# Exodus 18:06
He said to Moses,
``I,
your father-in-law Jethro,
have come to you with your wife,
and her two sons with her.''

# Exodus 18:07
Moses went out to meet his father-in-law,
and bowed and kissed him.

They asked each other of their welfare,
and they came into the tent.

# Exodus 18:08
Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake,
all the hardships that had come on them on the way,
and how Yahweh delivered them.

# Exodus 18:09
Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done to Israel,
in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.

# Exodus 18:10
Jethro said,
``Blessed be Yahweh,
who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,
and out of the hand of Pharaoh;
who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

# Exodus 18:11
Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of the way that they treated people arrogantly.''

# Exodus 18:12
Jethro,
Moses’ father-in-law,
took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God.

Aaron came with all the elders of Israel,
to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.

# Exodus 18:13
On the next day,
Moses sat to judge the people,
and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.

# Exodus 18:14
When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people,
he said,
``What is this thing that you do for the people?

Why do you sit alone,
and all the people stand around you from morning to evening?''

# Exodus 18:15
Moses said to his father-in-law,
``Because the people come to me to inquire of God.

# Exodus 18:16
When they have a matter,
they come to me,
and I judge between a man and his neighbor,
and I make them know the statutes of God,
and his laws.''

# Exodus 18:17
Moses’ father-in-law said to him,
``The thing that you do is not good.

# Exodus 18:18
You will surely wear away,
both you,
and this people that is with you;
for the thing is too heavy for you.

You are not able to perform it yourself alone.

# Exodus 18:19
Listen now to my voice.

I will give you counsel,
and God be with you.

You represent the people before God,
and bring the causes to God.

# Exodus 18:20
You shall teach them the statutes and the laws,
and shall show them the way in which they must walk,
and the work that they must do.

# Exodus 18:21
Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men which fear God:
men of truth,
hating unjust gain;
and place such over them,
to be rulers of thousands,
rulers of hundreds,
rulers of fifties,
and rulers of tens.

# Exodus 18:22
Let them judge the people at all times.

It shall be that every great matter they shall bring to you,
but every small matter they shall judge themselves.

So shall it be easier for you,
and they shall share the load with you.

# Exodus 18:23
If you will do this thing,
and God commands you so,
then you will be able to endure,
and all these people also will go to their place in peace.''

# Exodus 18:24
So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law,
and did all that he had said.

# Exodus 18:25
Moses chose able men out of all Israel,
and made them heads over the people,
rulers of thousands,
rulers of hundreds,
rulers of fifties,
and rulers of tens.

# Exodus 18:26
They judged the people at all times.

They brought the hard cases to Moses,
but every small matter they judged themselves.

# Exodus 18:27
Moses let his father-in-law depart,
and he went his way into his own land.

# Exodus 18:28
Exodus.

# Exodus 19:01
In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt,
on that same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.

# Exodus 19:02
When they had departed from Rephidim,
and had come to the wilderness of Sinai,
they encamped in the wilderness;
and there Israel encamped before the mountain.

# Exodus 19:03
Moses went up to God,
and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain,
saying,
``This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob,
and tell the children of Israel:

# Exodus 19:04
‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians,
and how I bore you on eagles’ wings,
and brought you to myself.

# Exodus 19:05
Now therefore,
if you will indeed obey my voice and keep my covenant,
then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples;
for all the earth is mine;

# Exodus 19:06
and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.''

# Exodus 19:07
Moses came and called for the elders of the people,
and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him.

# Exodus 19:08
All the people answered together,
and said,
``All that Yahweh has spoken we will do.''

Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.

# Exodus 19:09
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Behold,
I come to you in a thick cloud,
that the people may hear when I speak with you,
and may also believe you forever.''

Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.

# Exodus 19:10
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Go to the people,
and sanctify them today and tomorrow,
and let them wash their garments,

# Exodus 19:11
and be ready for the third day;
for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.

# Exodus 19:12
You shall set bounds to the people all around,
saying,
‘Be careful that you don't go up onto the mountain,
or touch its border.

Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.

# Exodus 19:13
No hand shall touch him,
but he shall surely be stoned or shot through;
whether it is animal or man,
he shall not live.’ When the trumpet sounds long,
they shall come up to the mountain.''

# Exodus 19:14
Moses went down from the mountain to the people,
and sanctified the people;
and they washed their clothes.

# Exodus 19:15
He said to the people,
``Be ready by the third day.

Don't have sexual relations with a woman.''

# Exodus 19:16
On the third day,
when it was morning,
there were thunders and lightnings,
and a thick cloud on the mountain,
and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet;
and all the people who were in the camp trembled.

# Exodus 19:17
Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God;
and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.

# Exodus 19:18
All of Mount Sinai smoked,
because Yahweh descended on it in fire;
and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace,
and the whole mountain quaked greatly.

# Exodus 19:19
When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder,
Moses spoke,
and God answered him by a voice.

# Exodus 19:20
Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai,
to the top of the mountain.

Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain,
and Moses went up.

# Exodus 19:21
Yahweh said to Moses,
``Go down,
warn the people,
lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze,
and many of them perish.

# Exodus 19:22
Let the priests also,
who come near to Yahweh,
sanctify themselves,
lest Yahweh break out on them.''

# Exodus 19:23
Moses said to Yahweh,
``The people can't come up to Mount Sinai,
for you warned us,
saying,
‘Set bounds around the mountain,
and sanctify it.’''

# Exodus 19:24
Yahweh said to him,
``Go down!

You shall bring Aaron up with you,
but don't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh,
lest he break out against them.''

# Exodus 19:25
So Moses went down to the people,
and told them.

# Exodus 19:26
Exodus.

# Exodus 20:18
All the people perceived the thunderings,
the lightnings,
the sound of the trumpet,
and the mountain smoking.

When the people saw it,
they trembled,
and stayed at a distance.

# Exodus 20:19
They said to Moses,
``Speak with us yourself,
and we will listen;
but don't let God speak with us,
lest we die.''

# Exodus 20:20
Moses said to the people,
``Don't be afraid,
for God has come to test you,
and that his fear may be before you,
that you won't sin.''

# Exodus 20:21
The people stayed at a distance,
and Moses came near to the thick darkness where God was.

# Exodus 20:22
Yahweh said to Moses,
``This is what you shall tell the children of Israel:
‘You yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.

# Exodus 20:23
You shall most certainly not make gods of silver or gods of gold for yourselves to be alongside me.

# Exodus 20:24
You shall make an altar of earth for me,
and shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings,
your sheep and your cattle.

In every place where I record my name I will come to you and I will bless you.

# Exodus 20:25
If you make me an altar of stone,
you shall not build it of cut stones;
for if you lift up your tool on it,
you have polluted it.

You shall not go up by steps to my altar,
that your nakedness may not be exposed to it.’

Exodus.

``Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them:

``If you buy a Hebrew servant,
he shall serve six years,
and in the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything.

# Exodus 21:03
If he comes in by himself,
he shall go out by himself.

If he is married,
then his wife shall go out with him.

# Exodus 21:04
If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters,
the wife and her children shall be her master's,
and he shall go out by himself.

# Exodus 21:05
But if the servant shall plainly say,
‘I love my master,
my wife,
and my children.

I will not go out free;’

# Exodus 21:06
then his master shall bring him to God,
and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost,

she shall not go out as the male servants do.

If she doesn't please her master,

He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people,

If he marries her to his son,
he shall deal with her as a daughter.

he shall not diminish her food,
