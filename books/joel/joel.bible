# Joel 01:01
Yahweh's word that came to Joel,
  the son of Pethuel.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.02
# Joel 01:02
Hear this,
  you elders,
and listen,
  all you inhabitants of the land!

Has this ever happened in your days,
or in the days of your fathers?

# Joel 01:03
Tell your children about it,
and have your children tell their children,
and their children, another generation.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.04
# Joel 01:04
What the swarming locust has left,
  the great locust has eaten.

What the great locust has left,
  the grasshopper has eaten.

What the grasshopper has left,
  the caterpillar has eaten.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.05
# Joel 01:05
Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!

Wail,
all you drinkers of wine,
because of the sweet wine,
for it is cut off from your mouth.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.06
# Joel 01:06
For a nation has come up on my land,
strong, and without number.

His teeth are the teeth of a lion,
and he has the fangs of a lioness.

# Joel 01:07
He has laid my vine waste,
and stripped my fig tree.

He has stripped its bark,
and thrown it away.

Its branches are made white.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.08
# Joel 01:08
Mourn like a virgin dressed in sackcloth
  for the husband of her youth!

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.09
# Joel 01:09
The meal offering and the drink offering
  are cut off from Yahweh's house.

The priests, Yahweh's ministers, mourn.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.10
# Joel 01:10
The field is laid waste.

The land mourns,
  for the grain is destroyed,
The new wine has dried up,
  and the oil languishes.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.11
# Joel 01:11
Be confounded, you farmers!

Wail, you vineyard keepers,
for the wheat and for the barley;
for the harvest of the field has perished.

# Joel 01:12
The vine has dried up,
and the fig tree withered ---
the pomegranate tree,
the palm tree also,
and the apple tree,
even all of the trees of the field are withered;
for joy has withered away from the sons of men.

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.13
# Joel 01:13
Put on sackcloth and mourn,
you priests!

Wail,
you ministers of the altar.

Come,
lie all night in sackcloth,
you ministers of my God,
for the meal offering and the drink offering
  are withheld from your God's house.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.14
# Joel 01:14
Sanctify a fast.

Call a solemn assembly.

Gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land
to the house of Yahweh, your God,
and cry to Yahweh.

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.15
# Joel 01:15
Alas for the day!

For the day of Yahweh is at hand,
and it will come as destruction from the Almighty.

# Joel 01:16
Isn't the food cut off before our eyes,
joy and gladness from the house of our God?

# Joel 01:17
The seeds rot under their clods.

The granaries are laid desolate.

The barns are broken down,
for the grain has withered.

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.18
# Joel 01:18
How the animals groan!

The herds of livestock are perplexed,
because they have no pasture.

Yes, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$01.19
# Joel 01:19
Yahweh,
I cry to you,
for the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness,
and the flame has burned all the trees of the field.

# Joel 01:20
Yes,
the animals of the field pant to you,
for the water brooks have dried up,
and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.01
# Joel 02:01
Blow the trumpet in Zion,
and sound an alarm in my holy mountain!

Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,
for the day of Yahweh comes,
for it is close at hand:

# Joel 02:02
A day of darkness and gloominess,
a day of clouds and thick darkness.

As the dawn spreading on the mountains,
a great and strong people;
there has never been the like,
neither will there be any more after them,
even to the years of many generations.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.03
# Joel 02:03
A fire devours before them,
and behind them,
a flame burns.

The land is as the garden of Eden before them,
and behind them, a desolate wilderness.

Yes, and no one has escaped them.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.04
# Joel 02:04
Their appearance is as the appearance of horses,
and they run as horsemen.

# Joel 02:05
Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, they leap,
like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble,
like a strong people set in battle array.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.06
# Joel 02:06
At their presence the peoples are in anguish.

All faces have grown pale.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.07
# Joel 02:07
They run like mighty men.

They climb the wall like warriors.

They each march in his line,
and they don't swerve off course.

# Joel 02:08
One doesn't jostle another.

They each march in their own path.

They burst through the defenses and don't break ranks.

# Joel 02:09
They rush on the city.

They run on the wall.

They climb up into the houses.

They enter in at the windows like thieves.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.10
# Joel 02:10
The earth quakes before them.

The heavens tremble.

The sun and the moon are darkened,
and the stars withdraw their shining.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.11
# Joel 02:11
Yahweh thunders his voice before his army,
for his forces are very great;
for he is strong who obeys his command;
for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome,
and who can endure it?

# Joel 02:12
{
  Yet even now,
}

says Yahweh,
{
  turn to me with all your heart,
  and with fasting,
  and with weeping,
  and with mourning.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.13
# Joel 02:13
Tear your heart and not your garments,
and turn to Yahweh, your God;
for he is gracious and merciful,
slow to anger,
and abundant in loving kindness,
and relents from sending calamity.

# Joel 02:14
Who knows?

He may turn and relent,
and leave a blessing behind him,
even a meal offering and a drink offering to Yahweh,
your God.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.15
# Joel 02:15
Blow the trumpet in Zion!

Sanctify a fast.

Call a solemn assembly.

# Joel 02:16
Gather the people.

Sanctify the assembly.

Assemble the elders.

Gather the children,
and those who nurse from breasts.

Let the bridegroom go out of his room,
and the bride out of her chamber.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.17
# Joel 02:17
Let the priests,
the ministers of Yahweh,
weep between the porch and the altar,
and let them say,
{
  Spare your people, Yahweh,
  and don't give your heritage to reproach,
  that the nations should rule over them.

  Why should they say among the peoples,
  {
    Where is their God?
  }
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.18
# Joel 02:18
Then Yahweh was jealous for his land,
and had pity on his people.

# Joel 02:19
Yahweh answered his people,
{
  Behold!
  I will send you grain, new wine, and oil,
  and you will be satisfied with them;
  and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations.

  # Joel 02:20
  But I will remove the northern army far away from you,
  and will drive it into a barren and desolate land,
  its front into the eastern sea,
  and its back into the western sea;
  and its stench will come up,
  and its bad smell will rise.
}

Surely he has done great things.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.21
# Joel 02:21
Land, don't be afraid.

Be glad and rejoice,
for Yahweh has done great things.

# Joel 02:22
Don't be afraid,
you animals of the field;
for the pastures of the wilderness spring up,
for the tree bears its fruit.

The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.23
# Joel 02:23
{
  Be glad then, you children of Zion,
  and rejoice in Yahweh, your God;
  for he gives you the early rain in just measure,
  and he causes the rain to come down for you,
  the early rain and the latter rain,
  as before.

  # Joel 02:24
  The threshing floors will be full of wheat,
  and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.

  # Joel 02:25
  I will restore to you the years
    that the swarming locust has eaten,
    the great locust,
    the grasshopper,
    and the caterpillar,
  my great army,
    which I sent among you.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.26
{
  # Joel 02:26
  You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied,
  and will praise the name of Yahweh, your God,
  who has dealt wondrously with you;
  and my people will never again be disappointed.

  # Joel 02:27
  You will know that I am among Israel,
  and that I am Yahweh, your God,
  and there is no one else;
  and my people will never again be disappointed.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.28
{
  # Joel 02:28
  It will happen afterward,
  that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh;
  and your sons and your daughters will prophesy.

  Your old men will dream dreams.

  Your young men will see visions.

  # Joel 02:29
  And also on the servants and on the handmaids in those days,
  I will pour out my Spirit.

  # Joel 02:30
  I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth:
  blood, fire, and pillars of smoke.

  # Joel 02:31
  The sun will be turned into darkness,
  and the moon into blood,
  before the great and terrible day of Yahweh comes.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$02.32
{
  # Joel 02:32
  It will happen that whoever will call on Yahweh's name shall be saved;
  for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape,
  as Yahweh has said,
  and among the remnant,
  those whom Yahweh calls.

# Joel 03:01
  For, behold!
  In those days,
  and in that time,
  when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
  # Joel 03:02
  I will gather all nations,
  and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat;
  and I will execute judgment on them there for my people,
  and for my heritage, Israel,
  whom they have scattered among the nations.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.02b
{
  # Joel 03:02b
  They have divided my land,
  # Joel 03:03
  and have cast lots for my people,
  and have given a boy for a prostitute,
  and sold a girl for wine,
  that they may drink.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.04
{
  # Joel 03:04
  Yes, and what are you to me,
  Tyre and Sidon,
  and all the regions of Philistia?

  Will you repay me?

  And if you repay me,
  I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.

  # Joel 03:05
  Because you have taken my silver and my gold,
  and have carried my finest treasures
    into your temples,
  # Joel 03:06
  and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem
    to the sons of the Greeks,
  that you may remove them far from their border.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.07
{
  # Joel 03:07
  Behold!
  I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them,
  and will return your repayment on your own head;
  # Joel 03:08
  and I will sell your sons and your daughters
    into the hands of the children of Judah,
  and they will sell them
    to the men of Sheba,
    to a faraway nation,
  for Yahweh has spoken it.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.09
# Joel 03:09
Proclaim this among the nations:
{
  Prepare for war!

  Stir up the mighty men.

  Let all the warriors draw near.

  Let them come up.

  # Joel 03:10
  Beat your plowshares into swords,
  and your pruning hooks into spears.

  Let the weak say,
  {
    I am strong.
  }

  # Joel 03:11
  Hurry and come,
  all you surrounding nations,
  and gather yourselves together.
}

Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.12
# Joel 03:12
{
  Let the nations arouse themselves,
  and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;
  for there I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.

  # Joel 03:13
  Put in the sickle;
  for the harvest is ripe.

  Come,
  tread,
  for the wine press is full,
  the vats overflow,
  for their wickedness is great.
}

# Joel 03:14
Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!

For the day of Yahweh is near in the valley of decision.

# Joel 03:15
The sun and the moon are darkened,
and the stars withdraw their shining.

# Joel 03:16
Yahweh will roar from Zion,
and thunder from Jerusalem;
and the heavens and the earth will shake;
but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,
and a stronghold to the children of Israel.

# Joel 03:17
{
  So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,
  dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain.

  Then Jerusalem will be holy,
  and no strangers will pass through her any more.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.18
{
  # Joel 03:18
  It will happen in that day,
  that the mountains will drop down sweet wine,
  the hills will flow with milk,
  all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters;
  and a fountain will flow out from Yahweh's house,
  and will water the valley of Shittim.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.19
{
  # Joel 03:19
  Egypt will be a desolation
  and Edom will be a desolate wilderness,
  for the violence done to the children of Judah,
  because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

  # Joel 03:20
  But Judah will be inhabited forever,
  and Jerusalem from generation to generation.

  # Joel 03:21
  I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed,
  for Yahweh dwells in Zion.
}
