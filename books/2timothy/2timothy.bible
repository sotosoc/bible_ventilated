To Timothy,
my beloved child:

Grace, mercy, and peace,
from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

# 2Timothy 01:03
STARTHERE

I thank God,
whom I serve as my forefathers did,
with a pure conscience.

How unceasing is my memory of you in my petitions,
night and day
# 2Timothy 01:04
longing to see you,
remembering your tears,
that I may be filled with joy;
# 2Timothy 01:05
having been reminded of the sincere faith that is in you,
which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and,
I am persuaded,
in you also.

# 2Timothy 01:06
For this cause,
I remind you that you should stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.

# 2Timothy 01:07
For God didn’t give us a spirit of fear,
but of power,
love,
and self-control.

# 2Timothy 01:08
Therefore don’t be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord,
nor of me his prisoner;
but endure hardship for the Good News according to the power of God,

# 2Timothy 01:09
who saved us and called us with a holy calling,
not according to our works,
but according to his own purpose and grace,
which was given to us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,

# 2Timothy 01:10
but has now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior,
Christ Jesus,
who abolished death,
and brought life and immortality to light through the Good News.

# 2Timothy 01:11
For this I was appointed as a preacher,
an apostle,
and a teacher of the Gentiles.

# 2Timothy 01:12
For this cause I also suffer these things.

Yet I am not ashamed,
for I know him whom I have believed,
and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed to him against that day.

# 2Timothy 01:13
Hold the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me,
in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

# 2Timothy 01:14
That good thing which was committed to you,
guard through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.

# 2Timothy 01:15
This you know,
that all who are in Asia turned away from me,
of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.

# 2Timothy 01:16
May the Lord grant mercy to the house of Onesiphorus,
for he often refreshed me,
and was not ashamed of my chain,

# 2Timothy 01:17
but when he was in Rome,
he sought me diligently and found me

# 2Timothy 01:18
(the Lord grant to him to find the Lord's mercy in that day);
and in how many things he served at Ephesus,
you know very well.

# 2Timothy 01:19
2 Timothy.

# 2Timothy 02:01
You therefore,
my child,
be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

# 2Timothy 02:02
The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses,
commit the same things to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.

# 2Timothy 02:03
You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

# 2Timothy 02:04
No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life,
that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.

# 2Timothy 02:05
Also,
if anyone competes in athletics,
he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.

# 2Timothy 02:06
The farmer who labors must be the first to get a share of the crops.

# 2Timothy 02:07
Consider what I say,
and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.

# 2Timothy 02:08
Remember Jesus Christ,
risen from the dead,
of the offspring of David,
according to my Good News,

# 2Timothy 02:09
in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal.

But God's word isn’t chained.

# 2Timothy 02:10
Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake,
that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

# 2Timothy 02:11
This saying is trustworthy:
``For if we died with him,
we will also live with him.

# 2Timothy 02:12
If we endure,
we will also reign with him.

If we deny him,
he also will deny us.

# 2Timothy 02:13
If we are faithless,
he remains faithful;
for he can’t deny himself.''

# 2Timothy 02:14
Remind them of these things,
charging them in the sight of the Lord that they don’t argue about words to no profit,
to the subverting of those who hear.

# 2Timothy 02:15
Give diligence to present yourself approved by God,
a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed,
properly handling the Word of Truth.

# 2Timothy 02:16
But shun empty chatter,
for it will go further in ungodliness,
# 2Timothy 02:17
and those words will consume like gangrene,
of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus:
# 2Timothy 02:18
men who have erred concerning the truth,
saying that the resurrection is already past,
and overthrowing the faith of some.

# 2Timothy 02:19
However,
God's firm foundation stands,
having this seal:
``The Lord knows those who are his,'' and,
``Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.''

# 2Timothy 02:20
Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver,
but also of wood and of clay.

Some are for honor and some for dishonor.

# 2Timothy 02:21
If anyone therefore purges himself from these,
he will be a vessel for honor,
sanctified,
and suitable for the master's use,
prepared for every good work.

# 2Timothy 02:22
Flee from youthful lusts;
but pursue righteousness,
faith,
love,
and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.

# 2Timothy 02:23
But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings,
knowing that they generate strife.

# 2Timothy 02:24
The Lord's servant must not quarrel,
but be gentle toward all,
able to teach,
patient,

# 2Timothy 02:25
in gentleness correcting those who oppose him.

Perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,

# 2Timothy 02:26
and they may recover themselves out of the devil's snare,
having been taken captive by him to do his will.

# 2Timothy 02:27
2 Timothy.

# 2Timothy 03:01
But know this:
that in the last days,
grievous times will come.

# 2Timothy 03:02
For men will be lovers of self,
lovers of money,
boastful,
arrogant,
blasphemers,
disobedient to parents,
unthankful,
unholy,

# 2Timothy 03:03
without natural affection,
unforgiving,
slanderers,
without self-control,
fierce,
not lovers of good,

# 2Timothy 03:04
traitors,
headstrong,
conceited,
lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,

# 2Timothy 03:05
holding a form of godliness but having denied its power.

Turn away from these,
also.

# 2Timothy 03:06
For some of these are people who creep into houses and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins,
led away by various lusts,

# 2Timothy 03:07
always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

# 2Timothy 03:08
Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses,
so these also oppose the truth,
men corrupted in mind,
who concerning the faith are rejected.

# 2Timothy 03:09
But they will proceed no further.

For their folly will be evident to all men,
as theirs also came to be.

# 2Timothy 03:10
But you followed my teaching,
conduct,
purpose,
faith,
patience,
love,
steadfastness,

# 2Timothy 03:11
persecutions,
and sufferings --- those things that happened to me at Antioch,
Iconium,
and Lystra.

I endured those persecutions.

The Lord delivered me out of them all.

# 2Timothy 03:12
Yes,
and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

# 2Timothy 03:13
But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse,
deceiving and being deceived.

# 2Timothy 03:14
But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of,
knowing from whom you have learned them.

# 2Timothy 03:15
From infancy,
you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

# 2Timothy 03:16
Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching,
for reproof,
for correction,
and for instruction in righteousness,

# 2Timothy 03:17
that each person who belongs to God may be complete,
thoroughly equipped for every good work.

# 2Timothy 03:18
2 Timothy.

# 2Timothy 04:01
I command you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ,
who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his Kingdom:

# 2Timothy 04:02
preach the word;
be urgent in season and out of season;
reprove,
rebuke,
and exhort with all patience and teaching.

# 2Timothy 04:03
For the time will come when they will not listen to the sound doctrine,
but having itching ears,
will heap up for themselves teachers after their own lusts,

# 2Timothy 04:04
and will turn away their ears from the truth,
and turn away to fables.

# 2Timothy 04:05
But you be sober in all things,
suffer hardship,
do the work of an evangelist,
and fulfill your ministry.

# 2Timothy 04:06
For I am already being offered,
and the time of my departure has come.

# 2Timothy 04:07
I have fought the good fight.

I have finished the course.

I have kept the faith.

# 2Timothy 04:08
From now on,
the crown of righteousness is stored up for me,
which the Lord,
the righteous judge,
will give to me on that day;
and not to me only,
but also to all those who have loved his appearing.

# 2Timothy 04:09
Be diligent to come to me soon,

# 2Timothy 04:10
for Demas left me,
having loved this present world,
and went to Thessalonica;
Crescens to Galatia;
and Titus to Dalmatia.

# 2Timothy 04:11
Only Luke is with me.

Take Mark and bring him with you,
for he is useful to me for service.

# 2Timothy 04:12
But I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.

# 2Timothy 04:13
Bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus when you come --- and the books,
especially the parchments.

# 2Timothy 04:14
Alexander the coppersmith did much evil to me.

The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.

# 2Timothy 04:15
Beware of him,
for he greatly opposed our words.

# 2Timothy 04:16
At my first defense,
no one came to help me,
but all left me.

May it not be held against them.

# 2Timothy 04:17
But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me,
that through me the message might be fully proclaimed,
and that all the Gentiles might hear.

So I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.

# 2Timothy 04:18
And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me for his heavenly Kingdom.

To him be the glory forever and ever.

Amen.

# 2Timothy 04:19
Greet Prisca and Aquila,
and the house of Onesiphorus.

# 2Timothy 04:20
Erastus remained at Corinth,
but I left Trophimus at Miletus sick.

# 2Timothy 04:21
Be diligent to come before winter.

Eubulus salutes you,
as do Pudens,
Linus,
Claudia,
and all the brothers.

# 2Timothy 04:22
The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

Grace be with you.

Amen.
