# Psalm 133:01
A Song of Ascents.

By David.

See how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to live together in unity!

# Psalm 133:02
It is like the precious oil on the head,
that ran down on the beard,
even Aaron's beard,
that came down on the edge of his robes,

# Psalm 133:03
like the dew of Hermon,
that comes down on the hills of Zion;
for there Yahweh gives the blessing,
even life forever more.
