# Job 03:01
After this Job opened his mouth,
and cursed the day of his birth.

# Job 03:02
Job answered:
# Job 03:03
{
  Let the day perish in which I was born,
  the night which said,
  {
    There is a boy conceived.
  }

  # Job 03:04
  Let that day be darkness.

  Don't let God from above seek for it,
  neither let the light shine on it.

  # Job 03:05
  Let darkness and the shadow of death
  claim it for their own.

  Let a cloud dwell on it.

  Let all that makes the day black terrify it.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.06
{
  # Job 03:06
  As for that night,
  let thick darkness seize on it.

  Let it not rejoice among the days of the year.

  Let it not come into the number of the months.

  # Job 03:07
  Behold!
  Let that night be barren.

  Let no joyful voice come therein.

  # Job 03:08
  Let them curse it who curse the day,
  who are ready to rouse up leviathan.

  # Job 03:09
  Let the stars of its twilight be dark.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.09b
{
  # Job 03:09b
  Let it look for light,
  but have none,
  neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,
  # Job 03:10
  because it didn't shut up the doors of my mother's womb,
  nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.

  # Job 03:11
  Why didn't I die from the womb?

  Why didn't I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?

  # Job 03:12
  Why did the knees receive me?

  Or why the breast,
  that I should nurse?

  # Job 03:13
  For now I should have lain down and been quiet.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.13b
{
  # Job 03:13b
  I should have slept,
  then I would have been at rest,
  # Job 03:14
  with kings and counselors of the earth,
  who built up waste places for themselves;
  # Job 03:15
  or with princes who had gold,
  who filled their houses with silver;
  # Job 03:16
  or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been,
  as infants who never saw light.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.17
{
  # Job 03:17
  There the wicked cease from troubling.

  There the weary are at rest.

  # Job 03:18
  There the prisoners are at ease together.

  They don't hear the voice of the taskmaster.

  # Job 03:19
  The small and the great are there.

  The servant is free from his master.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.20
{
  # Job 03:20
  Why is light given to him who is in misery,
  life to the bitter in soul,
  # Job 03:21
  who long for death,
  but it doesn't come;
  and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,
  # Job 03:22
  who rejoice exceedingly,
  and are glad,
  when they can find the grave?

  # Job 03:23
  Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,
  whom God has hedged in?
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$03.24
{
  # Job 03:24
  For my sighing comes before I eat.

  My groanings are poured out like water.

  # Job 03:25
  For the thing which I fear comes on me,
  that which I am afraid of comes to me.

  # Job 03:26
  I am not at ease,
  neither am I quiet,
  neither do I have rest;
  but trouble comes.
}

# Section: Eliphaz' First Speech\hfill{}$\geqq$04.01
# Job 04:01
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,
# Job 04:02
{
  If someone ventures to talk with you,
  will you be grieved?

  But who can withhold himself from speaking?

  # Job 04:03
  Behold!
  You have instructed many,
  you have strengthened the weak hands.

  # Job 04:04
  Your words have supported him who was falling,
  you have made the feeble knees firm.

  # Job 04:05
  But now it has come to you,
  and you faint.

  It touches you,
  and you are troubled.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$04.06
{
  # Job 04:06
  Isn't your piety your confidence?

  Isn't the integrity of your ways your hope?

  # Job 04:07
  Remember, now, whoever perished, being innocent?

  Or where were the upright cut off?
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$04.08
{
  # Job 04:08
  According to what I have seen,
  those who plow iniquity and sow trouble,
  reap the same.

  # Job 04:09
  By the breath of God they perish.

  By the blast of his anger are they consumed.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$04.10
{
  # Job 04:10
  The roaring of the lion,
  and the voice of the fierce lion,
  the teeth of the young lions,
  are broken.

  # Job 04:11
  The old lion perishes for lack of prey.

  The cubs of the lioness are scattered abroad.
}

# PresentationSection: \hfill{}$\geqq$04.12
{
  # Job 04:12
  Now a thing was secretly brought to me.

  My ear received a whisper of it.

  # Job 04:13
  In thoughts from the visions of the night,
  when deep sleep falls on men,
  # Job 04:14
  fear came on me,
  and trembling,
  which made all my bones shake.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$04.15
{
  # Job 04:15
  Then a spirit passed before my face.

  The hair of my flesh stood up.

  # Job 04:16
  It stood still,
  but I couldn't discern its appearance.

  A form was before my eyes.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$04.16b
{
  # Job 04:16b
  Silence,
  then I heard a voice,
  saying,
  # Job 04:17
  {
    Shall mortal man be more just than God?

    Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
  }
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$04.18
{
  {
    # Job 04:18
    Behold!
    He puts no trust in his servants.

    He charges his angels with error.

    # Job 04:19
    How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
    whose foundation is in the dust,
    who are crushed before the moth!

    # Job 04:20
    Between morning and evening they are destroyed.

    They perish forever without any regarding it.

    # Job 04:21
    Isn't their tent cord plucked up within them?

    They die,
    and that without wisdom.
  }
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$05.01
{
  # Job 05:01
  Call now.
  Is there any who will answer you?

  To which of the holy ones will you turn?
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$05.02
{
  # Job 05:02
  For resentment kills the foolish man,
  and jealousy kills the simple.

  # Job 05:03
  I have seen the foolish taking root,
  but suddenly I cursed his habitation.

  # Job 05:04
  His children are far from safety.

  They are crushed in the gate.

  Neither is there any to deliver them,
  # Job 05:05
  whose harvest the hungry eat up,
  and take it even out of the thorns.

  The snare gapes for their substance.

  # Job 05:06
  For affliction doesn't come out of the dust,
  neither does trouble spring out of the ground;
  # Job 05:07
  but man is born to trouble,
  as the sparks fly upward.

  # Job 05:08
  But as for me,
  I would seek God.

  I would commit my cause to God,
  # Job 05:09
  who does great things that can't be fathomed,
  marvelous things without number;
  # Job 05:10
  who gives rain on the earth,
  and sends waters on the fields;
  # Job 05:11
  so that he sets up on high those who are low,
  those who mourn are exalted to safety.

  # Job 05:12
  He frustrates the plans of the crafty,
  so that their hands can't perform their enterprise.

  # Job 05:13
  He takes the wise in their own craftiness;
  the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.

  # Job 05:14
  They meet with darkness in the day time,
  and grope at noonday as in the night.

  # Job 05:15
  But he saves from the sword of their mouth,
  even the needy from the hand of the mighty.

  # Job 05:16
  So the poor has hope,
  and injustice shuts her mouth.

  # Job 05:17
  Behold!
  Happy is the man whom God corrects.

  Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.

  # Job 05:18
  For he wounds and binds up.

  He injures and his hands make whole.

  # Job 05:19
  He will deliver you in six troubles;
  yes, in seven no evil will touch you.

  # Job 05:20
  In famine he will redeem you from death;
  in war,
  from the power of the sword.

  # Job 05:21
  You will be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
  neither will you be afraid of destruction when it comes.

  # Job 05:22
  You will laugh at destruction and famine,
  neither will you be afraid of the animals of the earth.

  # Job 05:23
  For you will be allied with the stones of the field.

  The animals of the field will be at peace with you.

  # Job 05:24
  You will know that your tent is in peace.

  You will visit your fold,
  and will miss nothing.

  # Job 05:25
  You will know also that your offspring will be great,
  your offspring as the grass of the earth.

  # Job 05:26
  You will come to your grave in a full age,
  like a shock of grain comes in its season.

  # Job 05:27
  Behold!
  We have researched it.

  It is so.

  Hear it,
  and know it for your good.

Then Job answered,
# Job 06:02
{
  Oh that my anguish were weighed,
  and all my calamity laid in the balances!

  # Job 06:03
  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas,
  therefore my words have been rash.

  # SEPARATOR

  # Job 06:04
  For the arrows of the Almighty are within me.

  My spirit drinks up their poison.

  # SEPARATOR

  The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$06.05
{
  # Job 06:05
  Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass?

  Or does the ox low over his fodder?

  # Job 06:06
  Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt?

  Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?

  # Job 06:07
  My soul refuses to touch them.

  They are as loathsome food to me.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$06.08
{
  # Job 06:08
  Oh that I might have my request,
  that God would grant the thing that I long for,

  even that it would please God to crush me;
  that he would let loose his hand,
  and cut me off!
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$06.10
{
  # Job 06:10
  Let it still be my consolation,
  yes, let me exult in pain that doesn't spare,
  that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$06.11
{
  # Job 06:11
  What is my strength,
    that I should wait?

  What is my end,
    that I should be patient?

  # Job 06:12
  Is my strength the strength of stones?

  Or is my flesh of bronze?

  # Job 06:13
  Isn't it that I have no help in me,
  that wisdom is driven away from me?

  # Job 06:14
  To him who is ready to faint,
  kindness should be shown from his friend;
  even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.

  # Job 06:15
  My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,
  as the channel of brooks that pass away;
  # Job 06:16
  which are black by reason of the ice,
  in which the snow hides itself.

  # Job 06:17
  In the dry season,
  they vanish.

  When it is hot,
  they are consumed out of their place.

  # Job 06:18
  The caravans that travel beside them turn away.

  They go up into the waste,
  and perish.

  # Job 06:19
  The caravans of Tema looked.

  The companies of Sheba waited for them.

  # Job 06:20
  They were distressed because they were confident.

  They came there,
  and were confounded.

  # Job 06:21
  For now you are nothing.

  You see a terror,
  and are afraid.

  # Job 06:22
  Did I ever say,
  {
    Give to me?
  }

  or,
  {
    Offer a present for me from your substance?
  }

  # Job 06:23
  or,
  {
    Deliver me from the adversary's hand?
  }

  or,
  {
    Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?
  }

  # Job 06:24
  Teach me,
  and I will hold my peace.

  Cause me to understand my error.

  # Job 06:25
  How forcible are words of uprightness!

  But your reproof,
  what does it reprove?

  # Job 06:26
  Do you intend to reprove words,
  since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?

  # Job 06:27
  Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless,
  and make merchandise of your friend.

  # Job 06:28
  Now therefore be pleased to look at me,
  for surely I will not lie to your face.

  # Job 06:29
  Please return.

  Let there be no injustice.

  Yes, return again.

  My cause is righteous.

  # Job 06:30
  Is there injustice on my tongue?

  Can't my taste discern mischievous things?

  # Job 07:01
  Isn't a man forced to labor on earth?

  Aren't his days like the days of a hired hand?

  # Job 07:02
  As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow,
  as a hireling who looks for his wages,
  # Job 07:03
  so I am made to possess months of misery,
  wearisome nights are appointed to me.

  # Job 07:04
  When I lie down,
  I say,
  {
    When will I arise,
    and the night be gone?
  }

  I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.

  # Job 07:05
  My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust.

  My skin closes up,
  and breaks out afresh.

  # Job 07:06
  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,
  and are spent without hope.

  # Job 07:07
  Oh remember that my life is a breath.

  My eye will no more see good.

  # Job 07:08
  The eye of him who sees me will see me no more.

  Your eyes will be on me,
  but I will not be.

  # Job 07:09
  As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away,
  so he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more.

  # Job 07:10
  He will return no more to his house,
  neither will his place know him any more.

{
  # Job 07:11
  Therefore I will not keep silent.

  I will speak in the anguish of my spirit.

  I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

  Am I a sea,
  or a sea monster,
  that you put a guard over me?

  # Job 07:13
  When I say,

  then you scare me with dreams
  and terrify me through visions,

  so that my soul chooses strangling,
  death rather than my bones.

  # Job 07:16
  I loathe my life.

  I don't want to live forever.

  Leave me alone,
  for my days are but a breath.

  # Job 07:17
  What is man,
  that you should magnify him,
  that you should set your mind on him,
  # Job 07:18
  that you should visit him every morning,
  and test him every moment?

  # Job 07:19
  How long will you not look away from me,
  nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?

  # Job 07:20
  If I have sinned,
  what do I do to you,
  you watcher of men?

  Why have you set me as a mark for you,
  so that I am a burden to myself?

  # Job 07:21
  Why do you not pardon my disobedience,
  and take away my iniquity?

  For now will I lie down in the dust.

  You will seek me diligently,
  but I will not be.

Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,
{
  # Job 08:02
  How long will you speak these things?

  Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?

  # Job 08:03
  Does God pervert justice?

  Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?

  # Job 08:04
  If your children have sinned against him,
  he has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.

  # Job 08:05
  If you want to seek God diligently,
  make your supplication to the Almighty.

  # Job 08:06
  If you were pure and upright,
  surely now he would awaken for you,
  and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.

  # Job 08:07
  Though your beginning was small,
  yet your latter end would greatly increase.

  # Job 08:08
  Please inquire of past generations.

  Find out about the learning of their fathers.

  # Job 08:09
  (For we are but of yesterday,
  and know nothing,
  because our days on earth are a shadow.)

  # Job 08:10
  Shall they not teach you,
  tell you,
  and utter words out of their heart?

  # Job 08:11
  Can the papyrus grow up without mire?

  Can the rushes grow without water?

  # Job 08:12
  While it is yet in its greenness,
  not cut down,
  it withers before any other reed.

{
  # Job 08:13
  So are the paths of all who forget God.

  The hope of the godless man will perish,
  # Job 08:14
  whose confidence will break apart,
  whose trust is a spider's web.

  # Job 08:15
  He will lean on his house,
  but it will not stand.

  He will cling to it,
  but it will not endure.

  # Job 08:16
  He is green before the sun.

  His shoots go out along his garden.

  # Job 08:17
  His roots are wrapped around the rock pile.

  He sees the place of stones.

  # Job 08:18
  If he is destroyed from his place,

  # Job 08:20
  Behold!
  God will not cast away a blameless man,
  neither will he uphold the evildoers.

Then Job answered,
# Job 09:02
{
  Truly I know that it is so,
  but how can man be just with God?

  # Job 09:03
  If he is pleased to contend with him,
  he can't answer him one time in a thousand.

  # Job 09:04
  God is wise in heart,
  and mighty in strength.

  Who has hardened himself against him and prospered?

  # Job 09:05
  He removes the mountains,
  and they don't know it,
  when he overturns them in his anger.

  # Job 09:06
  He shakes the earth out of its place.

  Its pillars tremble.

  # Job 09:07
  He commands the sun and it doesn't rise,
  and seals up the stars.

  # Job 09:08
  He alone stretches out the heavens,
  and treads on the waves of the sea.

  # Job 09:09
  He makes the Bear,
  Orion,
  and the Pleiades,
  and the rooms of the south.

  # Job 09:10
  He does great things past finding out;
  yes, marvelous things without number.

  # Job 09:11
  Behold!
  He goes by me,
  and I don't see him.

  He passes on also,
  but I don't perceive him.

  # Job 09:12
  Behold!
  He snatches away.

  Who can hinder him?

  Who will ask him,
  {
    What are you doing?
  }

  # Job 09:13
  God will not withdraw his anger.

  The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.

  # Job 09:14
  How much less will I answer him,
  and choose my words to argue with him?

  # Job 09:15
  Though I were righteous,
  yet I wouldn't answer him.

  I would make supplication to my judge.

  # Job 09:16
  If I had called,
  and he had answered me,
  yet I wouldn't believe that he listened to my voice.

  # Job 09:17
  For he breaks me with a storm,
  and multiplies my wounds without cause.

  # Job 09:18
  He will not allow me to catch my breath,
  but fills me with bitterness.

  # Job 09:19
  If it is a matter of strength,
  behold,
  he is mighty!

  If of justice,
  {
    Who,
  }

  says he,
  {
    will summon me?
  }

  # Job 09:20
  Though I am righteous,
  my own mouth will condemn me.

  Though I am blameless,
  it will prove me perverse.

  # Job 09:21
  I am blameless.

  I don't respect myself.

  I despise my life.

  # Job 09:22
  It is all the same.

  Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.

  # Job 09:23
  If the scourge kills suddenly,
  he will mock at the trial of the innocent.

  # Job 09:24
  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.

  He covers the faces of its judges.

  If not he,
  then who is it?

  # Job 09:25
  Now my days are swifter than a runner.

  They flee away.

  They see no good.

  # Job 09:28
  I am afraid of all my sorrows.

  I know that you will not hold me innocent.

  I will be condemned.

  Why then do I labor in vain?

  # Job 09:30
  If I wash myself with snow,
  and cleanse my hands with lye,
  # Job 09:31
  yet you will plunge me in the ditch.

  My own clothes will abhor me.

  # Job 09:32
  For he is not a man,
  as I am,
  that I should answer him,
  that we should come together in judgment.

  # Job 09:33
  There is no umpire between us,
  that might lay his hand on us both.

  # Job 09:34
  Let him take his rod away from me.

  Let his terror not make me afraid;

  Job.

  # Job 10:01
  My soul is weary of my life.

  I will give free course to my complaint.

  I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

  # Job 10:02
  I will tell God,
  {
    Do not condemn me.

    Show me why you contend with me.

    # Job 10:03
    Is it good to you that you should oppress,
    that you should despise the work of your hands,
    and smile on the counsel of the wicked?

    # Job 10:04
    Do you have eyes of flesh?

    Or do you see as man sees?

    # Job 10:05
    Are your days as the days of mortals,
    or your years as man's years,
    # Job 10:06
    that you inquire after my iniquity,
    and search after my sin?

    # Job 10:07
    Although you know that I am not wicked,
    there is no one who can deliver out of your hand.

    # Job 10:08
    Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether,
    yet you destroy me.

    # Job 10:09
    Remember,
    I beg you,

    Will you bring me into dust again?

    # Job 10:10
    Haven't you poured me out like milk,
    and curdled me like cheese?

    # Job 10:11
    You have clothed me with skin and flesh,
    and knit me together with bones and sinews.

    # Job 10:12
    You have granted me life and loving kindness.

    Your visitation has preserved my spirit.

    Yet you hid these things in your heart.

    I know that this is with you:

    # Job 10:14
    if I sin,
    then you mark me.

    You will not acquit me from my iniquity.

    # Job 10:15
    If I am wicked,
    woe to me.

    If I am righteous,
    I still will not lift up my head,
    being filled with disgrace,
    and conscious of my affliction.

    you hunt me like a lion.

    and increase your indignation on me.

    Changes and warfare are with me.

    then,
    have you brought me out of the womb?

    I wish I had given up the spirit,

Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered,
# Job 11:02
{
  Shouldn't the multitude of words be answered?

  Should a man full of talk be justified?

  # Job 11:03
  Should your boastings make men hold their peace?

  When you mock,
  will no man make you ashamed?

  # Job 11:04
  For you say,
  {
    My doctrine is pure.

    I am clean in your eyes.

  # Job 11:05
  But oh that God would speak,
  and open his lips against you,
  # Job 11:06
  that he would show you the secrets of wisdom!

  For true wisdom has two sides.

  Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.

  # Job 11:07
  Can you fathom the mystery of God?

  Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?

  # Job 11:08
  They are high as heaven.

  What can you do?

  They are deeper than Sheol.

  What can you know?

  # Job 11:09
  Its measure is longer than the earth,
  and broader than the sea.

  # Job 11:10
  If he passes by,
  or confines,
  or convenes a court,
  then who can oppose him?

  # Job 11:11
  For he knows false men.

  He sees iniquity also,
  even though he doesn't consider it.

  # Job 11:12
  An empty-headed man becomes wise when a man is born as a wild donkey's colt.

  # Job 11:13
  If you set your heart aright,
  stretch out your hands toward him.

  # Job 11:14
  If iniquity is in your hand,
  put it far away.

  Don't let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.

  # Job 11:15
  Surely then you will lift up your face without spot.

  Yes, you will be steadfast,
  and will not fear,
  # Job 11:16
  for you will forget your misery.

  You will remember it like waters that have passed away.

  # Job 11:17
  Life will be clearer than the noonday.

  Though there is darkness,
  it will be as the morning.

  # Job 11:18
  You will be secure,
  because there is hope.

  Yes, you will search,
  and will take your rest in safety.

  # Job 11:19
  Also you will lie down,
  and no one will make you afraid.

  # Job 12:22
  He uncovers deep things out of darkness,

  yet through the scent of water it will bud,

  You have reproached me ten times.

  You aren't ashamed that you attack me.

  If it is true that I have erred,
  my error remains with myself.

  If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me,
  and plead against me my reproach,

  and has surrounded me with his net.

  Behold!
  I cry out of wrong,
  but I am not heard.

  I cry for help,
  but there is no justice.

  # Job 19:08
  He has walled up my way so that I can't pass,
  and has set darkness in my paths.

  # Job 19:09
  He has stripped me of my glory,
  and taken the crown from my head.

  # Job 19:10
  He has broken me down on every side,
  and I am gone.

  He has plucked my hope up like a tree.

  # Job 19:11
  He has also kindled his wrath against me.

  He counts me among his adversaries.

  # Job 19:12
  His troops come on together,
  build a siege ramp against me,
  and encamp around my tent.

  # Job 19:13
  He has put my brothers far from me.

  My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.

  # Job 19:14
  My relatives have gone away.

  My familiar friends have forgotten me.

  # Job 19:15
  Those who dwell in my house and my maids consider me a stranger.

  I am an alien in their sight.

  # Job 19:16
  I call to my servant,
  and he gives me no answer.

  I beg him with my mouth.

  # Job 19:17
  My breath is offensive to my wife.

  I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.

  # Job 19:18
  Even young children despise me.

  If I arise,
  they speak against me.

  # Job 19:19
  All my familiar friends abhor me.

  They whom I loved have turned against me.

  # Job 19:20
  My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.

  I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.

  # Job 19:21
  Have pity on me.

  Have pity on me,
  you my friends,
  for the hand of God has touched me.

  # Job 19:22
  Why do you persecute me as God,
  and are not satisfied with my flesh?

  # Job 19:23
  Oh that my words were now written!

  Oh that they were inscribed in a book!

  # Job 19:24
  That with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever!

  # Job 19:25
  But as for me,
  I know that my Redeemer lives.

  In the end,
  he will stand upon the earth.

  # Job 19:26
  After my skin is destroyed,
  then I will see God in my flesh,
  # Job 19:27
  whom I,
  even I,
  will see on my side.

  My eyes will see,
  and not as a stranger.

  My heart is consumed within me.

  # Job 19:28
  If you say,
  {
    How we will persecute him!

{
  Therefore my thoughts answer me,
  even by reason of my haste that is in me.

  # Job 20:03
  I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame.

  The spirit of my understanding answers me.

  # Job 20:04
  Don't you know this from old time,
  since man was placed on earth,
  # Job 20:05
  that the triumphing of the wicked is short,
  the joy of the godless but for a moment?

  # Job 20:06
  Though his height mount up to the heavens,
  and his head reach to the clouds,
  # Job 20:07
  yet he will perish forever like his own dung.

  Those who have seen him will say,
  {
    Where is he?
  }

  # Job 20:08
  He will fly away as a dream,
  and will not be found.

  Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night.

  # Job 20:09
  The eye which saw him will see him no more,
  neither will his place see him any more.

  # Job 20:10
  His children will seek the favor of the poor.

  His hands will give back his wealth.

  # Job 20:11
  His bones are full of his youth,
  but youth will lie down with him in the dust.

  # Job 20:12
  Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth,
  though he hide it under his tongue,
  # Job 20:13
  though he spare it,
  and will not let it go,
  but keep it still within his mouth,
  # Job 20:14
  yet his food in his bowels is turned.

  It is cobra venom within him.

  # Job 20:15
  He has swallowed down riches,
  and he will vomit them up again.

  God will cast them out of his belly.

  # Job 20:16
  He will suck cobra venom.

  The viper's tongue will kill him.

  # Job 20:17
  He will not look at the rivers,
  the flowing streams of honey and butter.

  # Job 20:18
  He will restore that for which he labored,
  and will not swallow it down.

  He will not rejoice according to the substance that he has gotten.

  # Job 20:19
  For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor.

  He has violently taken away a house,
  and he will not build it up.

  # Job 20:20
  Because he knew no quietness within him,
  he will not save anything of that in which he delights.

  # Job 20:21
  There was nothing left that he didn't devour,
  therefore his prosperity will not endure.

  # Job 20:22
  In the fullness of his sufficiency,
  distress will overtake him.

  The hand of everyone who is in misery will come on him.

  # Job 20:23
  When he is about to fill his belly,
  God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him.

  It will rain on him while he is eating.

  # Job 20:24
  He will flee from the iron weapon.

  The bronze arrow will strike him through.

  # Job 20:25
  He draws it out,
  and it comes out of his body.

  Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver.

  Terrors are on him.

  # Job 20:26
  All darkness is laid up for his treasures.

  An unfanned fire will devour him.

  It will consume that which is left in his tent.

  # Job 20:27
  The heavens will reveal his iniquity.

  The earth will rise up against him.

  # Job 20:28
  The increase of his house will depart.

  Why do the wicked live,

  Their child is established with them in their sight,

  They sing to the tambourine and harp,

  They spend their days in prosperity.

  In an instant they go down to Sheol.

  Behold!
  Their prosperity is not in their hand.

  The counsel of the wicked is far from me.

  # Job 21:17
  How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out,
  that their calamity comes on them,
  that God distributes sorrows in his anger?

  # Job 21:18
  How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind,

  # Job 21:19
  You say,
  {
    God lays up his iniquity for his children.

  Let him recompense it to himself,

  Let his own eyes see his destruction.

  Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

  For what does he care for his house after him,
  when the number of his months is cut off?

  # Job 21:22
  Shall any teach God knowledge,

  # Job 21:23
  One dies in his full strength,

  # Job 21:24
  His pails are full of milk.

  The marrow of his bones is moistened.

  Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous?

  to the furthest bound,
  the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.

  # Job 28:04
  He breaks open a shaft away from where people live.

  They are forgotten by the foot.

  They hang far from men,
  they swing back and forth.

  # Job 28:05
  As for the earth,
  out of it comes bread.

  Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.

  # Job 28:06
  Sapphires come from its rocks.

  It has dust of gold.

  # Job 28:07
  That path no bird of prey knows,
  neither has the falcon's eye seen it.

  # Job 28:08
  The proud animals have not trodden it,
  nor has the fierce lion passed by there.

  # Job 28:09
  He puts his hand on the flinty rock,
  and he overturns the mountains by the roots.

  # Job 28:10
  He cuts out channels among the rocks.

  His eye sees every precious thing.

  # Job 28:11
  He binds the streams that they don't trickle.

  The thing that is hidden he brings out to light.

  # Job 28:12
  But where will wisdom be found?

  Where is the place of understanding?

  # Job 28:13
  Man doesn't know its price,
  and it isn't found in the land of the living.

  # Job 28:14
  The deep says,
  {
    It isn't in me.
  }

  The sea says,
  {
    It isn't with me.
  }

  # Job 28:15
  It can't be gotten for gold,
  neither will silver be weighed for its price.

  # Job 28:16
  It can't be valued with the gold of Ophir,
  with the precious onyx,
  or the sapphire.

  # Job 28:17
  Gold and glass can't equal it,
  neither will it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.

  # Job 28:18
  No mention will be made of coral or of crystal.

  Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.

  # Job 28:19
  The topaz of Ethiopia will not equal it.

  It won't be valued with pure gold.

  # Job 28:20
  Where then does wisdom come from?

  Where is the place of understanding?

  # Job 28:21
  Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living,
  and kept close from the birds of the sky.

  # Job 28:22
  Destruction and Death say,
  {
    We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.
  }

  # Job 28:23
  God understands its way,
  and he knows its place.

  # Job 28:24
  For he looks to the ends of the earth,
  and sees under the whole sky.

  # Job 28:25
  He establishes the force of the wind.

  Yes, he measures out the waters by measure.

  # Job 28:26
  When he made a decree for the rain,
  and a way for the lightning of the thunder,
  # Job 28:27
  then he saw it,
  and declared it.

  He established it,
  yes, and searched it out.

  # Job 28:28
  To man he said,
  {
    Behold!
    the fear of the Lord,
    that is wisdom.

    To depart from evil is understanding.

  # Job 29:11
  For when the ear heard me,

    it commended me,
  # Job 29:12
  because I delivered the poor who cried,
  and the fatherless also,

  If now you have understanding,
  hear this.

  Listen to the voice of my words.

  # Job 34:17
  Should even one who hates justice govern?

  Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty,
  # Job 34:18
  who says to a king,
  ‘Vile!’ or to nobles,
  ‘Wicked!’?

  # Job 34:19
  He doesn't respect the persons of princes,
  nor respect the rich more than the poor,
  for they all are the work of his hands.

  # Job 34:20
  In a moment they die,
  even at midnight.

  The people are shaken and pass away.

  The mighty are taken away without a hand.

  # Job 34:21
  For his eyes are on the ways of a man.

  He sees all his goings.

  # Job 34:22
  There is no darkness,
  nor thick gloom,
  where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

  # Job 34:23
  For he doesn't need to consider a man further,
  that he should go before God in judgment.

  # Job 34:24
  He breaks mighty men in pieces in ways past finding out,
  and sets others in their place.

  # Job 34:25
  Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.

  He overturns them in the night,
  so that they are destroyed.

  # Job 34:26
  He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
  # Job 34:27
  because they turned away from following him,
  and wouldn't pay attention to any of his ways,
  # Job 34:28
  so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him.

  He heard the cry of the afflicted.

  # Job 34:29
  When he gives quietness,
  who then can condemn?

  When he hides his face,
  who then can see him?

  He is over a nation or a man alike,
  # Job 34:30
  that the godless man may not reign,
  that there be no one to ensnare the people.

  # Job 34:31
  For has any said to God,
  {
    I am guilty,
    but I will not offend any more.

    # Job 34:32
    Teach me that which I don't see.

    If I have done iniquity,
    I will do it no more
  }

  ?

  # Job 34:33
  Shall his recompense be as you desire,
  that you refuse it?

  For you must choose,
  and not I.

  Therefore speak what you know.

  # Job 34:34
  Men of understanding will tell me,
  yes, every wise man who hears me:

  # Job 34:35
  ‘Job speaks without knowledge.

  His words are without wisdom.’

  # Job 34:36
  I wish that Job were tried to the end,
  because of his answering like wicked men.

  # Job 34:37
  For he adds rebellion to his sin.

  He claps his hands among us,
  and multiplies his words against God.

# Job 35:01
Moreover Elihu answered,
# Job 35:02
{
  Do you think this to be your right,
  or do you say,
  ‘My righteousness is more than God's,’

  # Job 35:03
  that you ask,
  ‘What advantage will it be to you?

  What profit will I have,
  more than if I had sinned?’

  # Job 35:04
  I will answer you,
  and your companions with you.

  # Job 35:05
  Look to the skies,
  and see.

  See the skies,
  which are higher than you.

  # Job 35:06
  If you have sinned,
  what effect do you have against him?

  If your transgressions are multiplied,
  what do you do to him?

  # Job 35:07
  If you are righteous,
  what do you give him?

  Or what does he receive from your hand?

  # Job 35:08
  Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are,
  and your righteousness may profit a son of man.

  # Job 35:09
  By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out.

  They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.

  # Job 35:10
  But no one says,
  ‘Where is God my Maker,
  who gives songs in the night,
  # Job 35:11
  who teaches us more than the animals of the earth,
  and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’

  # Job 35:12
  There they cry,
  but no one answers,
  because of the pride of evil men.

  # Job 35:13
  Surely God will not hear an empty cry,
  neither will the Almighty regard it.

  # Job 35:14
  How much less when you say you don't see him.

  The cause is before him,
  and you wait for him!

  # Job 35:15
  But now,
  because he has not visited in his anger,
  neither does he greatly regard arrogance,
  # Job 35:16
  therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk,
  and he multiplies words without knowledge.
}

# Section: \hfill{}$\geqq$36.01
# Job 36:01
Elihu also continued,
and said,
# Job 36:02
{
  Bear with me a little,
  and I will show you;
  for I still have something to say on God's behalf.

  # Job 36:03
  I will get my knowledge from afar,
  and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

  # Job 36:04
  For truly my words are not false.

  One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.

  # Job 36:05
  Behold!
  God is mighty,
  and doesn't despise anyone.

  He is mighty in strength of understanding.

  # Job 36:06
  He doesn't preserve the life of the wicked,
  but gives justice to the afflicted.

  # Job 36:07
  He doesn't withdraw his eyes from the righteous,
  but with kings on the throne,
  he sets them forever,
  and they are exalted.

  # Job 36:08
  If they are bound in fetters,
  and are taken in the cords of afflictions,
  # Job 36:09
  then he shows them their work,
  and their transgressions,
  that they have behaved themselves proudly.

  # Job 36:10
  He also opens their ears to instruction,
  and commands that they return from iniquity.

  # Job 36:11
  If they listen and serve him,
  they will spend their days in prosperity,
  and their years in pleasures.

  # Job 36:12
  But if they don't listen,
  they will perish by the sword;
  they will die without knowledge.

  # Job 36:13
  But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.

  They don't cry for help when he binds them.

  # Job 36:14
  They die in youth.

  Their life perishes among the unclean.

  # Job 36:15
  He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,
  and opens their ear in oppression.

  # Job 36:16
  Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,
  into a wide place,
  where there is no restriction.

  That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.

  # Job 36:17
  But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.

  Judgment and justice take hold of you.

  # Job 36:18
  Don't let riches entice you to wrath,
  neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.

  # Job 36:19
  Would your wealth sustain you in distress,
  or all the might of your strength?

  # Job 36:20
  Don't desire the night,
  when people are cut off in their place.

  # Job 36:21
  Take heed,
  don't regard iniquity;
  for you have chosen this rather than affliction.

  # Job 36:22
  Behold!
  God is exalted in his power.

  Who is a teacher like him?

  # Job 36:23
  Who has prescribed his way for him?

  Or who can say,
  ‘You have committed unrighteousness?’

  # Job 36:24
  Remember that you magnify his work,
  about which men have sung.

  # Job 36:25
  All men have looked on it.

  Man sees it afar off.

  # Job 36:26
  Behold!
  God is great,
  and we don't know him.

  The number of his years is unsearchable.

  # Job 36:27
  For he draws up the drops of water,
  which distill in rain from his vapor,
  # Job 36:28
  which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly.

  # Job 36:29
  Indeed,
  can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds and the thunderings of his pavilion?

  # Job 36:30
  Behold!
  He spreads his light around him.

  He covers the bottom of the sea.

  # Job 36:31
  For by these he judges the people.

  He gives food in abundance.

  # Job 36:32
  He covers his hands with the lightning,
  and commands it to strike the mark.

  # Job 36:33
  Its noise tells about him,
  and the livestock also,
  concerning the storm that comes up.

  # Job 36:34
  Job.

  # Job 37:01
  Yes, at this my heart trembles,
  and is moved out of its place.

  # Job 37:02
  Hear,
  oh,
  hear the noise of his voice,
  the sound that goes out of his mouth.

  # Job 37:03
  He sends it out under the whole sky,
  and his lightning to the ends of the earth.

  # Job 37:04
  After it a voice roars.

  He thunders with the voice of his majesty.

  He doesn't hold back anything when his voice is heard.

  # Job 37:05
  God thunders marvelously with his voice.

  He does great things,
  which we can't comprehend.

  # Job 37:06
  For he says to the snow,
  ‘Fall on the earth,’ likewise to the shower of rain,
  and to the showers of his mighty rain.

  # Job 37:07
  He seals up the hand of every man,
  that all men whom he has made may know it.

  # Job 37:08
  Then the animals take cover,
  and remain in their dens.

  # Job 37:09
  Out of its room comes the storm,
  and cold out of the north.

  # Job 37:10
  By the breath of God,
  ice is given,
  and the width of the waters is frozen.

  # Job 37:11
  Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture.

  He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.

  # Job 37:12
  It is turned around by his guidance,
  that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world,
  # Job 37:13
  whether it is for correction,
  or for his land,
  or for loving kindness,
  that he causes it to come.

  # Job 37:14
  Listen to this,
  Job.

  Stand still,
  and consider the wondrous works of God.

  # Job 37:15
  Do you know how God controls them,
  and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?

  # Job 37:16
  Do you know the workings of the clouds,
  the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?

  # Job 37:17
  You whose clothing is warm when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?

  # Job 37:18
  Can you,
  with him,
  spread out the sky,
  which is strong as a cast metal mirror?

  # Job 37:19
  Teach us what we will tell him,
  for we can't make our case by reason of darkness.

  # Job 37:20
  Will it be told him that I would speak?

  Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?

  # Job 37:21
  Now men don't see the light which is bright in the skies,
  but the wind passes,
  and clears them.

  # Job 37:22
  Out of the north comes golden splendor.

  With God is awesome majesty.

  # Job 37:23
  We can't reach the Almighty.

  He is exalted in power.

  In justice and great righteousness,
  he will not oppress.

  # Job 37:24
  Therefore men revere him.

  He doesn't regard any who are wise of heart.
