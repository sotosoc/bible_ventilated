For the Chief Musician.

A Psalm by David.

Deliver me,
Yahweh,
from evil men.

Preserve me from violent men:

# Psalm 140:02
those who devise mischief in their hearts.

They continually gather themselves together for war.

# Psalm 140:03
They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent.

Viper's poison is under their lips.

Selah.

# Psalm 140:04
Yahweh,
keep me from the hands of the wicked.

Preserve me from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.

# Psalm 140:05
The proud have hidden a snare for me,
they have spread the cords of a net by the path.

They have set traps for me.

Selah.

# Psalm 140:06
I said to Yahweh,
``You are my God.''

Listen to the cry of my petitions,
Yahweh.

# Psalm 140:07
Yahweh,
the Lord,
the strength of my salvation,
you have covered my head in the day of battle.

# Psalm 140:08
Yahweh,
don't grant the desires of the wicked.

Don't let their evil plans succeed,
or they will become proud.

Selah.

# Psalm 140:09
As for the head of those who surround me,
let the mischief of their own lips cover them.

# Psalm 140:10
Let burning coals fall on them.

Let them be thrown into the fire,
into miry pits,
from where they never rise.

# Psalm 140:11
An evil speaker won't be established in the earth.

Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

# Psalm 140:12
I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
and justice for the needy.

# Psalm 140:13
Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name.

The upright will dwell in your presence.
