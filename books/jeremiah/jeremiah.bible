in the land of Benjamin.

in the days of Josiah
  the son of Amon,

# Jeremiah 01:04
Now Yahweh's word came to me,
saying,
# Jeremiah 01:05
{
  Before I formed you in the womb,
  I knew you.

  Before you were born,
  I sanctified you.

  I have appointed you a prophet to the nations.
}

# Jeremiah 01:06
Then I said,
{
  Ah, Lord Yahweh!

  Behold!
  I don’t know how to speak;
  for I am a child.
}

# Jeremiah 01:07
But Yahweh said to me,
{
  Don’t say,
  {
    I am a child;
  }

  for you must go to whomever I send you,
  and you must say whatever I command you.

  # Jeremiah 01:08
  Don’t be afraid because of them,
  for I am with you to rescue you,
}

says Yahweh.

  Behold!
  I have today set you
  over the nations and over the kingdoms,
  to uproot and to tear down,
  to destroy and to overthrow,
  to build and to plant.

#{
#  They will come,

#
#  # Jeremiah 01:16
#  I will utter my judgments against them concerning all their wickedness,
#  in that they have forsaken me,
#  and have burned incense to other gods,
#  and worshiped the works of their own hands.
#
#  # Jeremiah 01:17
#  You therefore put your belt on your waist,

#  Don’t be dismayed at them,

#{
#  Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem,

#  {
#    Yahweh says,
#    {
#      I remember for you the kindness of your youth,
#      your love as a bride,
#      how you went after me in the wilderness,
#      in a land that was not sown.
#
#      # Jeremiah 02:03
#      Israel was holiness to Yahweh,
#      the first fruits of his increase.
#
#      All who devour him will be held guilty.

#      Evil will come on them,

## Jeremiah 02:04
#Hear Yahweh's word, O house of Jacob,
#and all the families of the house of Israel!
#
## Jeremiah 02:05
#Yahweh says,
#{
#  What unrighteousness have your fathers found in me,
#  that they have gone far from me,
#  and have walked after worthless vanity,
#  and have become worthless?
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:06
#  They didn’t say,
#  {
#    Where is Yahweh
#    who brought us up out of the land of Egypt,
#    who led us through the wilderness,
#    through a land of deserts and of pits,
#    through a land of drought and of the shadow of death,
#    through a land that no one passed through,
#    and where no man lived?
#  }
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:07
#  I brought you into a plentiful land
#  to eat its fruit and its goodness;
#  but when you entered,
#  you defiled my land,
#  and made my heritage an abomination.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:08
#  The priests didn’t say,
#  {
#    Where is Yahweh?
#  }
#
#  and those who handle the law didn’t know me.
#
#  The rulers also transgressed against me,
#  and the prophets prophesied by Baal
#  and followed things that do not profit.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:09
#  Therefore I will yet contend with you,
#}
#
#says Yahweh,
#{
#  and I will contend with your children's children.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:10
#  For pass over to the islands of Kittim,
#  and see.
#
#  Send to Kedar,
#  and consider diligently,
#  and see if there has been such a thing.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:11
#  Has a nation changed its gods,
#  which really are no gods?
#
#  But my people have changed their glory
#  for that which doesn’t profit.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:12
#  Be astonished, you heavens,
#  at this and be horribly afraid.
#
#  Be very desolate,
#}
#
#says Yahweh.
## Jeremiah 02:13
#{
#  For my people have committed two evils:
#  they have forsaken me,
#    the spring of living waters,
#  and cut out cisterns for themselves:
#  broken cisterns that can’t hold water.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:14
#  Is Israel a slave?
#
#  Is he born into slavery?
#
#  Why has he become a captive?
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:15
#  The young lions have roared at him
#  and raised their voices.
#
#  They have made his land waste.
#
#  His cities are burned up,
#  without inhabitant.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:16
#  The children also of Memphis and Tahpanhes
#  have broken the crown of your head.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:17
#  Haven’t you brought this on yourself,
#  in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,
#  when he led you by the way?
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:18
#  Now what do you gain by going to Egypt,
#  to drink the waters of the Shihor?
#
#  Or why do you to go on the way to Assyria,
#  to drink the waters of the River?
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:19
#  Your own wickedness will correct you,
#  and your backsliding will rebuke you.
#
#  Know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing,
#  that you have forsaken Yahweh your God,
#  and that my fear is not in you,
#}
#
#says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.
#
## Jeremiah 02:20
#{
#  For long ago I broke off your yoke,
#  and burst your bonds.
#
#  You said,
#  {
#    I will not serve;
#  }
#
#  for on every high hill and under every green tree
#  you bowed yourself, playing the prostitute.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:21
#  Yet I had planted you a noble vine,
#  a pure and faithful seed.
#
#  How then have you turned into the degenerate branches of a foreign vine to me?
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:22
#  For though you wash yourself with lye,
#  and use much soap,
#  yet your iniquity is marked before me,
#}
#
#says the Lord Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 02:23
#{
#  How can you say,
#  {
#    I am not defiled.
#
#    I have not gone after the Baals
#  }?
#
#  See your way in the valley.
#
#  Know what you have done.
#
#  You are a swift dromedary traversing her ways,
#  # Jeremiah 02:24
#  a wild donkey used to the wilderness,
#  that sniffs the wind in her craving.
#
#  When she is in heat,
#  who can turn her away?
#
#  All those who seek her will not weary themselves.
#
#  In her month,
#  they will find her.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:25
#  Keep your feet from being bare,
#  and your throat from thirst.
#
#  But you said,
#  {
#    It is in vain.
#
#    No,
#    for I have loved strangers,
#    and I will go after them.
#  }
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:26
#  As the thief is ashamed when he is found,
#  so the house of Israel is ashamed ---
#  they,
#  their kings,
#  their princes,
#  their priests,
#  and their prophets,
#  # Jeremiah 02:27
#  who tell wood,
#  {
#    You are my father,
#  }
#
#  and a stone,
#  {
#    You have given birth to me,
#  }
#  for they have turned their back to me,
#  and not their face,
#  but in the time of their trouble they will say,
#  {
#    Arise, and save us!
#  }
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:28
#  But where are your gods that you have made for yourselves?
#
#  Let them arise,
#  if they can save you in the time of your trouble,
#  for you have as many gods as you have towns, O Judah.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:29
#  Why will you contend with me?
#
#  You all have transgressed against me,
#}
#
#says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 02:30
#{
#  I have struck your children in vain.
#
#  They received no correction.
#
#  Your own sword has devoured your prophets,
#  like a destroying lion.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:31
#  Generation,
#  consider Yahweh's word.
#
#  Have I been a wilderness to Israel?
#
#  Or a land of thick darkness?
#
#  Why do my people say,
#  {
#    We have broken loose.
#
#    We will come to you no more
#  }?
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:32
#  Can a virgin forget her ornaments,
#  or a bride her attire?
#
#  Yet my people have forgotten me
#  for days without number.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:33
#  How well you prepare your way to seek love!
#
#  Therefore
#  you have even taught the wicked women your ways.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:34
#  Also the blood of the souls of the innocent poor
#  is found in your skirts.
#
#  You didn’t find them breaking in,
#  but it is because of all these things.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:35
#  Yet you said,
#  {
#    I am innocent.
#
#    Surely his anger has turned away from me.
#  }
#
#  Behold!
#  I will judge you,
#  because you say,
#  {
#    I have not sinned.
#  }
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:36
#  Why do you go about so much to change your ways?
#
#  You will be ashamed of Egypt also,
#  as you were ashamed of Assyria.
#
#  # Jeremiah 02:37
#  You will also leave that place
#  with your hands on your head;
#  for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust,
#  and you won’t prosper with them.
#
#  # Jeremiah 03:01
#  They say,
#  {
#    If a man puts away his wife,
#    and she goes from him,
#    and becomes another man's,
#    should he return to her again?
#  }
#
#  Wouldn’t that land be greatly polluted?
#
#But you have played the prostitute with many lovers;
#yet return again to me,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 03:02
#``Lift up your eyes to the bare heights,
#and see!
#
#Where have you not been lain with?
#
#You have sat waiting for them by the road,
#as an Arabian in the wilderness.
#
#You have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.
#
## Jeremiah 03:03
#Therefore the showers have been withheld and there has been no latter rain;
#yet you have had a prostitute's forehead and you refused to be ashamed.
#
## Jeremiah 03:04
#Will you not from this time cry to me,
#‘My Father,
#you are the guide of my youth!’?
#
## Jeremiah 03:05
#``‘Will he retain his anger forever?
#
#Will he keep it to the end?’ Behold,
#you have spoken and have done evil things,
#and have had your way.''
#
## Jeremiah 03:06
#Moreover,
#Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king,
#``Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done?
#
#She has gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree,
#and has played the prostitute there.
#
## Jeremiah 03:07
#I said after she had done all these things,
#‘She will return to me;’ but she didn’t return,
#and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
#
## Jeremiah 03:08
#I saw when,
#for this very cause,
#that backsliding Israel had committed adultery,
#I had put her away and given her a certificate of divorce,
#yet treacherous Judah,
#her sister,
#had no fear,
#but she also went and played the prostitute.
#
## Jeremiah 03:09
#Because she took her prostitution lightly,
#the land was polluted,
#and she committed adultery with stones and with wood.
#
## Jeremiah 03:10
#Yet for all this her treacherous sister,
#Judah,
#has not returned to me with her whole heart,
#but only in pretense,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 03:11
#Yahweh said to me,
#``Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 03:12
#Go,
#and proclaim these words toward the north,
#and say,
#‘Return,
#you backsliding Israel,’ says Yahweh;
#‘I will not look in anger on you,
#for I am merciful,’ says Yahweh.
#
#‘I will not keep anger forever.
#
## Jeremiah 03:13
#Only acknowledge your iniquity,
#that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God,
#and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree,
#and you have not obeyed my voice,’'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 03:14
#``Return,
#backsliding children,'' says Yahweh,
#``for I am a husband to you.
#
#I will take one of you from a city,
#and two from a family,
#and I will bring you to Zion.
#
## Jeremiah 03:15
#I will give you shepherds according to my heart,
#who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.
#
## Jeremiah 03:16
#It will come to pass,
#when you are multiplied and increased in the land in those days,'' says Yahweh,
#``they will no longer say,
#‘the ark of Yahweh's covenant!’ It will not come to mind.
#
#They won’t remember it.
#
#They won’t miss it,
#nor will another be made.
#
## Jeremiah 03:17
#At that time they will call Jerusalem ‘Yahweh's Throne;’ and all the nations will be gathered to it,
#to Yahweh's name,
#to Jerusalem.
#
#They will no longer walk after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
#
## Jeremiah 03:18
#In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel,
#and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your fathers.
#
## Jeremiah 03:19
#``But I said,
#‘How I desire to put you among the children,
#and give you a pleasant land,
#a goodly heritage of the armies of the nations!’ and I said,
#‘You shall call me
#``
#My Father'',
#and shall not turn away from following me.’
#
## Jeremiah 03:20
#``Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband,
#so you have dealt treacherously with me,
#house of Israel,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 03:21
#A voice is heard on the bare heights,
#the weeping and the petitions of the children of Israel;
#because they have perverted their way,
#they have forgotten Yahweh their God.
#
## Jeremiah 03:22
#Return,
#you backsliding children,
#and I will heal your backsliding.
#
#``Behold,
#we have come to you;
#for you are Yahweh our God.
#
## Jeremiah 03:23
#Truly help from the hills,
#the tumult on the mountains,
#is in vain.
#
#Truly the salvation of Israel is in Yahweh our God.
#
## Jeremiah 03:24
#But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth,
#their flocks and their herds,
#their sons and their daughters.
#
## Jeremiah 03:25
#Let us lie down in our shame,
#and let our confusion cover us;
#for we have sinned against Yahweh our God,
#we and our fathers,
#from our youth even to this day.
#
#We have not obeyed Yahweh our God's voice.''
#
## Jeremiah 04:01
#``If you will return,
#Israel,'' says Yahweh,
#``if you will return to me,
#and if you will put away your abominations out of my sight;
#then you will not be removed;
#
## Jeremiah 04:02
#and you will swear,
#‘As Yahweh lives,’ in truth,
#in justice,
#and in righteousness.
#
#The nations will bless themselves in him,
#and they will glory in him.''
#
## Jeremiah 04:03
#For Yahweh says to the men of Judah and to Jerusalem,
#``Break up your fallow ground,
#and don’t sow among thorns.
#
## Jeremiah 04:04
#Circumcise yourselves to Yahweh,
#and take away the foreskins of your heart,
#you men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem;
#lest my wrath go out like fire,
#and burn so that no one can quench it,
#because of the evil of your doings.
#
## Jeremiah 04:05
#Declare in Judah,
#and publish in Jerusalem;
#and say,
#‘Blow the trumpet in the land!’ Cry aloud and say,
#‘Assemble yourselves!
#
#Let's go into the fortified cities!’
#
## Jeremiah 04:06
#Set up a standard toward Zion.
#
#Flee for safety!
#
#Don’t wait;
#for I will bring evil from the north,
#and a great destruction.''
#
## Jeremiah 04:07
#A lion has gone up from his thicket,
#and a destroyer of nations.
#
#He is on his way.
#
#He has gone out from his place,
#to make your land desolate,
#that your cities be laid waste,
#without inhabitant.
#
## Jeremiah 04:08
#For this,
#clothe yourself with sackcloth,
#lament and wail;
#for the fierce anger of Yahweh hasn’t turned back from us.
#
## Jeremiah 04:09
#``It will happen at that day,'' says Yahweh,
#``that the heart of the king will perish,
#along with the heart of the princes.
#
#The priests will be astonished,
#and the prophets will wonder.''
#
## Jeremiah 04:10
#Then I said,
#``Ah,
#Lord Yahweh!
#
#Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem,
#saying,
#‘You will have peace;’ whereas the sword reaches to the heart.''
#
## Jeremiah 04:11
#At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem,
#``A hot wind blows from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people,
#not to winnow,
#nor to cleanse.
#
## Jeremiah 04:12
#A full wind from these will come for me.
#
#Now I will also utter judgments against them.''
#
## Jeremiah 04:13
#Behold,
#he will come up as clouds,
#and his chariots will be as the whirlwind.
#
#His horses are swifter than eagles.
#
#Woe to us!
#
#For we are ruined.
#
## Jeremiah 04:14
#Jerusalem,
#wash your heart from wickedness,
#that you may be saved.
#
#How long will your evil thoughts lodge within you?
#
## Jeremiah 04:15
#For a voice declares from Dan,
#and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:
#
## Jeremiah 04:16
#``Tell the nations,
#behold,
#publish against Jerusalem,
#‘Watchers come from a far country,
#and raise their voice against the cities of Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 04:17
#As keepers of a field,
#they are against her all around,
#because she has been rebellious against me,’'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 04:18
#``Your way and your doings have brought these things to you.
#
#This is your wickedness,
#for it is bitter,
#for it reaches to your heart.''
#
## Jeremiah 04:19
#My anguish,
#my anguish!
#
#I am pained at my very heart!
#
#My heart trembles within me.
#
#I can’t hold my peace,
#because you have heard,
#O my soul,
#the sound of the trumpet,
#the alarm of war.
#
## Jeremiah 04:20
#Destruction on destruction is decreed,
#for the whole land is laid waste.
#
#Suddenly my tents are destroyed,
#and my curtains gone in a moment.
#
## Jeremiah 04:21
#How long will I see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet?
#
## Jeremiah 04:22
#``For my people are foolish.
#
#They don’t know me.
#
#They are foolish children,
#and they have no understanding.
#
#They are skillful in doing evil,
#but they don’t know how to do good.''
#
## Jeremiah 04:23
#I saw the earth and,
#behold,
#it was waste and void,
#and the heavens,
#and they had no light.
#
## Jeremiah 04:24
#I saw the mountains,
#and behold,
#they trembled,
#and all the hills moved back and forth.
#
## Jeremiah 04:25
#I saw,
#and behold,
#there was no man,
#and all the birds of the sky had fled.
#
## Jeremiah 04:26
#I saw,
#and behold,
#the fruitful field was a wilderness,
#and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh,
#before his fierce anger.
#
## Jeremiah 04:27
#For Yahweh says,
#``The whole land will be a desolation;
#yet I will not make a full end.
#
## Jeremiah 04:28
#For this the earth will mourn,
#and the heavens above be black,
#because I have spoken it.
#
#I have planned it,
#and I have not repented,
#neither will I turn back from it.''
#
## Jeremiah 04:29
#Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and archers.
#
#They go into the thickets and climb up on the rocks.
#
#Every city is forsaken,
#and not a man dwells therein.
#
## Jeremiah 04:30
#You,
#when you are made desolate,
#what will you do?
#
#Though you clothe yourself with scarlet,
#though you deck yourself with ornaments of gold,
#though you enlarge your eyes with makeup,
#you make yourself beautiful in vain.
#
#Your lovers despise you.
#
#They seek your life.
#
## Jeremiah 04:31
#For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail,
#the anguish as of her who gives birth to her first child,
#the voice of the daughter of Zion,
#who gasps for breath,
#who spreads her hands,
#saying,
#``Woe is me now!
#
#For my soul faints before the murderers.''
#
## Jeremiah 05:01
#``Run back and forth through the streets of Jerusalem,
#and see now,
#and know,
#and seek in its wide places,
#if you can find a man,
#if there is anyone who does justly,
#who seeks truth,
#then I will pardon her.
#
## Jeremiah 05:02
#Though they say,
#‘As Yahweh lives,’ surely they swear falsely.''
#
## Jeremiah 05:03
#O Yahweh,
#don’t your eyes look on truth?
#
#You have stricken them,
#but they were not grieved.
#
#You have consumed them,
#but they have refused to receive correction.
#
#They have made their faces harder than a rock.
#
#They have refused to return.
#
## Jeremiah 05:04
#Then I said,
#``Surely these are poor.
#
#They are foolish;
#for they don’t know Yahweh's way,
#nor the law of their God.
#
## Jeremiah 05:05
#I will go to the great men and will speak to them,

#
#But these with one accord have broken the yoke,
#and burst the bonds.
#
## Jeremiah 05:06
#Therefore a lion out of the forest will kill them.
#
#A wolf of the evenings will destroy them.
#
#A leopard will watch against their cities.
#
#Everyone who goes out there will be torn in pieces,
#because their transgressions are many and their backsliding has increased.
#
## Jeremiah 05:07
#``How can I pardon you?
#
#Your children have forsaken me,
#and sworn by what are no gods.
#
#When I had fed them to the full,
#they committed adultery,
#and assembled themselves in troops at the prostitutes’ houses.
#
## Jeremiah 05:08
#They were as fed horses roaming at large.

#Everyone neighed after his neighbor's wife.

## Jeremiah 05:09

## Jeremiah 05:12
#They have denied Yahweh,

#Evil won’t come on us.

## Jeremiah 05:13
#The prophets will become wind,

## Jeremiah 05:14
#Therefore Yahweh,

## Jeremiah 05:15

## Jeremiah 05:17
#They will eat up your harvest and your bread,

## Jeremiah 05:18
#``But even in those days,'' says Yahweh,
#``I will not make a full end of you.

## Jeremiah 05:19

## Jeremiah 07:05
#For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings,
#if you thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor;

## Jeremiah 07:06
#if you don’t oppress the foreigner,
#the fatherless,
#and the widow,
#and don’t shed innocent blood in this place,

#‘We are delivered,’ that you may do all these abominations?

## Jeremiah 07:11
#Has this house,
#which is called by my name,

## Jeremiah 07:12
#``But go now to my place which was in Shiloh,

## Jeremiah 07:21
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel says:
#``Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat meat.

## Jeremiah 07:22
#For I didn’t speak to your fathers or command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices;

#but this thing I commanded them,
#saying,
#‘Listen to my voice,

#Walk in all the way that I command you,
#that it may be well with you.’

## Jeremiah 07:24
#But they didn’t listen or turn their ear,

## Jeremiah 07:25
#Since the day that your fathers came out of the land of Egypt to this day,
#I have sent to you all my servants the prophets,
#daily rising up early and sending them.

## Jeremiah 07:26
#Yet they didn’t listen to me or incline their ear,
#but made their neck stiff.

#They did worse than their fathers.

## Jeremiah 07:27
#``You shall speak all these words to them,
#but they will not listen to you.
#
#You shall also call to them,
#but they will not answer you.

## Jeremiah 07:29
#Cut off your hair,

## Jeremiah 07:30
#``For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight,'' says Yahweh.

#``They have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name,
#to defile it.

## Jeremiah 07:31
#They have built the high places of Topheth,
#which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
#to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire,
#which I didn’t command,
#nor did it come into my mind.
#
## Jeremiah 07:32
#Therefore behold,
#the days come'',

## Jeremiah 08:01
#``At that time,'' says Yahweh,

#I will send the sword after them,
#until I have consumed them.''
#
## Jeremiah 09:17
#Yahweh of Armies says,
#``Consider,
#and call for the mourning women,
#that they may come.
#
#Send for the skillful women,
#that they may come.
#
## Jeremiah 09:18
#Let them make haste and take up a wailing for us,
#that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with waters.
#
## Jeremiah 09:19
#For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion,
#‘How we are ruined!
#
#We are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land,
#because they have cast down our dwellings.’''
#
## Jeremiah 09:20
#Yet hear Yahweh's word,
#you women.
#
#Let your ear receive the word of his mouth.
#
#Teach your daughters wailing.
#
#Everyone teach her neighbor a lamentation.
#
## Jeremiah 09:21
#For death has come up into our windows.
#
#It has entered into our palaces to cut off the children from outside,
#and the young men from the streets.
#
## Jeremiah 09:22
#Speak,
#``Yahweh says,
#``‘The dead bodies of men will fall as dung on the open field,
#and as the handful after the harvester.
#
#No one will gather them.’''
#
## Jeremiah 09:23
#Yahweh says,
#``Don’t let the wise man glory in his wisdom.
#
#Don’t let the mighty man glory in his might.
#
#Don’t let the rich man glory in his riches.
#
## Jeremiah 09:24
#But let him who glories glory in this,
#that he has understanding,
#and knows me,
#that I am Yahweh who exercises loving kindness,
#justice,
#and righteousness in the earth,
#for I delight in these things,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 09:25
#``Behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that I will punish all those who are circumcised only in their flesh:
#
## Jeremiah 09:26
#Egypt,
#Judah,
#Edom,
#the children of Ammon,
#Moab,
#and all who have the corners of their hair cut off,
#who dwell in the wilderness,
#for all the nations are uncircumcised,
#and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.''
#
## Jeremiah 10:01
#Hear the word which Yahweh speaks to you,
#house of Israel!
#
## Jeremiah 10:02
#Yahweh says,
#``Don’t learn the way of the nations,
#and don’t be dismayed at the signs of the sky;
#for the nations are dismayed at them.
#
## Jeremiah 10:03
#For the customs of the peoples are vanity;
#for one cuts a tree out of the forest,
#the work of the hands of the workman with the ax.
#
## Jeremiah 10:04
#They deck it with silver and with gold.
#
#They fasten it with nails and with hammers,
#so that it can’t move.
#
## Jeremiah 10:05
#They are like a palm tree,
#of turned work,
#and don’t speak.
#
#They must be carried,
#because they can’t move.
#
#Don’t be afraid of them;
#for they can’t do evil,
#neither is it in them to do good.''
#
## Jeremiah 10:06
#There is no one like you,
#Yahweh.
#
#You are great,
#and your name is great in might.
#
## Jeremiah 10:07
#Who shouldn’t fear you,
#King of the nations?
#
#For it belongs to you.
#
#Because among all the wise men of the nations,
#and in all their royal estate,
#there is no one like you.
#
## Jeremiah 10:08
#But they are together brutish and foolish,
#instructed by idols!
#
#It is just wood.
#
## Jeremiah 10:09
#There is silver beaten into plates,
#which is brought from Tarshish,
#and gold from Uphaz,
#the work of the engraver and of the hands of the goldsmith.
#
#Their clothing is blue and purple.
#
#They are all the work of skillful men.
#
## Jeremiah 10:10
#But Yahweh is the true God.
#
#He is the living God,
#and an everlasting King.
#
#At his wrath,
#the earth trembles.
#
#The nations aren’t able to withstand his indignation.
#
## Jeremiah 10:11
#``You shall say this to them:
#‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth,
#and from under the heavens.’''
#
## Jeremiah 10:12
#God has made the earth by his power.
#
#He has established the world by his wisdom,
#and by his understanding has he stretched out the heavens.
#
## Jeremiah 10:13
#When he utters his voice,
#the waters in the heavens roar,
#and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.
#
#He makes lightnings for the rain,
#and brings the wind out of his treasuries.
#
## Jeremiah 10:14
#Every man has become brutish and without knowledge.
#
#Every goldsmith is disappointed by his engraved image;
#for his molten image is falsehood,
#and there is no breath in them.
#
## Jeremiah 10:15
#They are vanity,
#a work of delusion.
#
#In the time of their visitation they will perish.
#
## Jeremiah 10:16
#The portion of Jacob is not like these;
#for he is the maker of all things;
#and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance.
#
#Yahweh of Armies is his name.
#
## Jeremiah 10:17
#Gather up your wares out of the land,
#you who live under siege.
#
## Jeremiah 10:18
#For Yahweh says,
#``Behold,
#I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time,
#and will distress them,
#that they may feel it.''
#
## Jeremiah 10:19
#Woe is me because of my injury!
#
#My wound is serious;
#but I said,
#``Truly this is my grief,
#and I must bear it.''
#
## Jeremiah 10:20
#My tent has been destroyed,
#and all my cords are broken.
#
#My children have gone away from me,
#and they are no more.
#
#There is no one to spread my tent any more,
#to set up my curtains.
#
## Jeremiah 10:21
#For the shepherds have become brutish,
#and have not inquired of Yahweh.
#
#Therefore they have not prospered,
#and all their flocks have scattered.
#
## Jeremiah 10:22
#The voice of news,
#behold,
#it comes,
#and a great commotion out of the north country,
#to make the cities of Judah a desolation,
#a dwelling place of jackals.
#
## Jeremiah 10:23
#Yahweh,
#I know that the way of man is not in himself.
#
#It is not in man who walks to direct his steps.
#
## Jeremiah 10:24
#Yahweh,
#correct me,
#but gently;
#not in your anger,
#lest you reduce me to nothing.
#
## Jeremiah 10:25
#Pour out your wrath on the nations that don’t know you,
#and on the families that don’t call on your name;
#for they have devoured Jacob.
#
#Yes,
#they have devoured him,
#consumed him,
#and have laid waste his habitation.
#
## Jeremiah 11:01
#The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 11:02
#``Hear the words of this covenant,
#and speak to the men of Judah,
#and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
#
## Jeremiah 11:03
#and say to them,
#Yahweh,
#the God of Israel says:
#‘Cursed is the man who doesn’t hear the words of this covenant,
#
## Jeremiah 11:04
#which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt,
#out of the iron furnace,’ saying,
#‘Obey my voice and do them,
#according to all which I command you;
#so you shall be my people,
#and I will be your God;
#
## Jeremiah 11:05
#that I may establish the oath which I swore to your fathers,
#to give them a land flowing with milk and honey,’ as it is today.''
#
#Then I answered,
#and said,
#``Amen,
#Yahweh.''
#
## Jeremiah 11:06
#Yahweh said to me,
#``Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah,
#and in the streets of Jerusalem,
#saying,
#‘Hear the words of this covenant,
#and do them.
#
## Jeremiah 11:07
#For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt,
#even to this day,
#rising early and protesting,
#saying,
#``Obey my voice.''
#
## Jeremiah 11:08
#Yet they didn’t obey,
#nor turn their ear,
#but everyone walked in the stubbornness of their evil heart.
#
#Therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant,
#which I commanded them to do,
#but they didn’t do them.’''
#
## Jeremiah 11:09
#Yahweh said to me,
#``A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah,
#and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
#
## Jeremiah 11:10
#They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers,
#who refused to hear my words.
#
#They have gone after other gods to serve them.
#
#The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
#
## Jeremiah 11:11
#Therefore Yahweh says,
#‘Behold,
#I will bring evil on them which they will not be able to escape;
#and they will cry to me,
#but I will not listen to them.
#
## Jeremiah 11:12
#Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem will go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense,
#but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.
#
## Jeremiah 11:13
#For according to the number of your cities are your gods,
#Judah;
#and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem you have set up altars to the shameful thing,
#even altars to burn incense to Baal.’
#
## Jeremiah 11:14
#``Therefore don’t pray for this people.
#
#Don’t lift up cry or prayer for them;
#for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.
#
## Jeremiah 11:15
#What has my beloved to do in my house,
#since she has behaved lewdly with many,
#and the holy flesh has passed from you?
#
#When you do evil,
#then you rejoice.''
#
## Jeremiah 11:16
#Yahweh called your name,
#``A green olive tree,
#beautiful with goodly fruit.''
#
#With the noise of a great roar he has kindled fire on it,
#and its branches are broken.
#
## Jeremiah 11:17
#For Yahweh of Armies,
#who planted you,
#has pronounced evil against you,
#because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah,
#which they have done to themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.
#
## Jeremiah 11:18
#Yahweh gave me knowledge of it,
#and I knew it.
#
#Then you showed me their doings.
#
## Jeremiah 11:19
#But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.
#
#I didn’t know that they had devised plans against me,
#saying,
#``Let's destroy the tree with its fruit,
#and let's cut him off from the land of the living,
#that his name may be no more remembered.''
#
## Jeremiah 11:20
#But,
#Yahweh of Armies,
#who judges righteously,
#who tests the heart and the mind,
#I will see your vengeance on them;
#for to you I have revealed my cause.
#
## Jeremiah 11:21
#``Therefore Yahweh says concerning the men of Anathoth,
#who seek your life,
#saying,
#‘You shall not prophesy in Yahweh's name,
#that you not die by our hand’ ---
#
## Jeremiah 11:22
#therefore Yahweh of Armies says,
#‘Behold,
#I will punish them.
#
#The young men will die by the sword.
#
#Their sons and their daughters will die by famine.
#
## Jeremiah 11:23
#There will be no remnant to them,
#for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth,
#even the year of their visitation.’''
#
## Jeremiah 12:01
#You are righteous,
#Yahweh,
#when I contend with you;
#yet I would like to plead a case with you.
#
#Why does the way of the wicked prosper?
#
#Why are they all at ease who deal very treacherously?
#
## Jeremiah 12:02
#You have planted them.
#
#Yes,
#they have taken root.
#
#They grow.
#
#Yes,
#they produce fruit.
#
#You are near in their mouth,
#and far from their heart.
#
## Jeremiah 12:03
#But you,
#Yahweh,
#know me.
#
#You see me,
#and test my heart toward you.
#
#Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter,
#and prepare them for the day of slaughter.
#
## Jeremiah 12:04
#How long will the land mourn,
#and the herbs of the whole country wither?
#
#Because of the wickedness of those who dwell therein,
#the animals and birds are consumed;
#because they said,
#``He won’t see our latter end.''
#
## Jeremiah 12:05
#``If you have run with the footmen,
#and they have wearied you,
#then how can you contend with horses?
#
#Though in a land of peace you are secure,
#yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?
#
## Jeremiah 12:06
#For even your brothers,
#and the house of your father,
#even they have dealt treacherously with you!
#
#Even they have cried aloud after you!
#
#Don’t believe them,
#though they speak beautiful words to you.
#
## Jeremiah 12:07
#``I have forsaken my house.
#
#I have cast off my heritage.
#
#I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
#
## Jeremiah 12:08
#My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest.
#
#She has uttered her voice against me.
#
#Therefore I have hated her.
#
## Jeremiah 12:09
#Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey?
#
#Are the birds of prey against her all around?
#
#Go,
#assemble all the animals of the field.
#
#Bring them to devour.
#
## Jeremiah 12:10
#Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard.
#
#They have trodden my portion under foot.
#
#They have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.
#
## Jeremiah 12:11
#They have made it a desolation.
#
#It mourns to me,
#being desolate.
#
#The whole land is made desolate,
#because no one cares.
#
## Jeremiah 12:12
#Destroyers have come on all the bare heights in the wilderness;
#for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land.
#
#No flesh has peace.
#
## Jeremiah 12:13
#They have sown wheat,
#and have reaped thorns.
#
#They have exhausted themselves,
#and profit nothing.
#
#You will be ashamed of your fruits,
#because of Yahweh's fierce anger.''
#
## Jeremiah 12:14
#Yahweh says,
#``Concerning all my evil neighbors,
#who touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit:
#Behold,
#I will pluck them up from off their land,
#and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
#
## Jeremiah 12:15
#It will happen that after I have plucked them up,
#I will return and have compassion on them.
#
#I will bring them again,
#every man to his heritage,
#and every man to his land.
#
## Jeremiah 12:16
#It will happen,
#if they will diligently learn the ways of my people,
#to swear by my name,
#‘As Yahweh lives;’ even as they taught my people to swear by Baal,
#then they will be built up in the middle of my people.
#
## Jeremiah 12:17
#But if they will not hear,
#then I will pluck up that nation,
#plucking up and destroying it,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 13:01
#Yahweh said to me,
#``Go,
#and buy yourself a linen belt,
#and put it on your waist,
#and don’t put it in water.''
#
## Jeremiah 13:02
#So I bought a belt according to Yahweh's word,
#and put it on my waist.
#
## Jeremiah 13:03
#Yahweh's word came to me the second time,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 13:04
#``Take the belt that you have bought,
#which is on your waist,
#and arise,
#go to the Euphrates,
#and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.''
#
## Jeremiah 13:05
#So I went and hid it by the Euphrates,
#as Yahweh commanded me.
#
## Jeremiah 13:06
#After many days,
#Yahweh said to me,
#``Arise,
#go to the Euphrates,
#and take the belt from there,
#which I commanded you to hide there.''
#
## Jeremiah 13:07
#Then I went to the Euphrates,
#and dug,
#and took the belt from the place where I had hidden it;
#and behold,
#the belt was ruined.
#
#It was profitable for nothing.
#
## Jeremiah 13:08
#Then Yahweh's word came to me,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 13:09
#``Yahweh says,
#‘In this way I will ruin the pride of Judah,
#and the great pride of Jerusalem.
#
## Jeremiah 13:10
#This evil people,
#who refuse to hear my words,
#who walk in the stubbornness of their heart,
#and have gone after other gods to serve them and to worship them,
#will even be as this belt,
#which is profitable for nothing.
#
## Jeremiah 13:11
#For as the belt clings to the waist of a man,
#so I have caused the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah to cling to me,’ says Yahweh;
#‘that they may be to me for a people,
#for a name,
#for praise,
#and for glory;
#but they would not hear.’
#
## Jeremiah 13:12
#``Therefore you shall speak to them this word:
#‘Yahweh,
#the God of Israel says,
#``Every container should be filled with wine.''’ They will tell you,
#‘Do we not certainly know that every container should be filled with wine?’
#
## Jeremiah 13:13
#Then tell them,
#‘Yahweh says,
#``Behold,
#I will fill all the inhabitants of this land,
#even the kings who sit on David's throne,
#the priests,
#the prophets,
#and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
#with drunkenness.
#
## Jeremiah 13:14
#I will dash them one against another,
#even the fathers and the sons together,'' says Yahweh:
#``I will not pity,
#spare,
#or have compassion,
#that I should not destroy them.''’''
#
## Jeremiah 13:15
#Hear,
#and give ear.
#
#Don’t be proud,
#for Yahweh has spoken.
#
## Jeremiah 13:16
#Give glory to Yahweh your God,
#before he causes darkness,
#and before your feet stumble on the dark mountains,
#and while you look for light,
#he turns it into the shadow of death,
#and makes it deep darkness.
#
## Jeremiah 13:17
#But if you will not hear it,
#my soul will weep in secret for your pride.
#
#My eye will weep bitterly,
#and run down with tears,
#because Yahweh's flock has been taken captive.
#
## Jeremiah 13:18
#Say to the king and to the queen mother,
#``Humble yourselves.
#
#Sit down,
#for your crowns have come down,
#even the crown of your glory.
#
## Jeremiah 13:19
#The cities of the South are shut up,
#and there is no one to open them.
#
#Judah is carried away captive:
#all of them.
#
#They are wholly carried away captive.
#
## Jeremiah 13:20
#Lift up your eyes,
#and see those who come from the north.
#
#Where is the flock that was given to you,
#your beautiful flock?
#
## Jeremiah 13:21
#What will you say when he sets over you as head those whom you have yourself taught to be friends to you?
#
#Won’t sorrows take hold of you,
#as of a woman in travail?
#
## Jeremiah 13:22
#If you say in your heart,
#``Why have these things come on me?''
#
#Your skirts are uncovered because of the greatness of your iniquity,
#and your heels suffer violence.
#
## Jeremiah 13:23
#Can the Ethiopian change his skin,
#or the leopard his spots?
#
#Then may you also do good,
#who are accustomed to do evil.
#
## Jeremiah 13:24
#``Therefore I will scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.
#
## Jeremiah 13:25
#This is your lot,
#the portion measured to you from me,'' says Yahweh,
#``because you have forgotten me,
#and trusted in falsehood.''
#
## Jeremiah 13:26
#Therefore I will also uncover your skirts on your face,
#and your shame will appear.
#
## Jeremiah 13:27
#I have seen your abominations,
#even your adulteries and your neighing,
#the lewdness of your prostitution,
#on the hills in the field.
#
#Woe to you,
#Jerusalem!
#
#You will not be made clean.
#
#How long will it yet be?''
#
## Jeremiah 14:01
#This is Yahweh's word that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought:
#
## Jeremiah 14:02
#``Judah mourns,
#and its gates languish.
#
#They sit in black on the ground.
#
#The cry of Jerusalem goes up.
#
## Jeremiah 14:03
#Their nobles send their little ones to the waters.
#
#They come to the cisterns,
#and find no water.
#
#They return with their vessels empty.
#
#They are disappointed and confounded,
#and cover their heads.
#
## Jeremiah 14:04
#Because of the ground which is cracked,
#because no rain has been in the land,
#the plowmen are disappointed.
#
#They cover their heads.
#
## Jeremiah 14:05
#Yes,
#the doe in the field also calves and forsakes her young,
#because there is no grass.
#
## Jeremiah 14:06
#The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights.
#
#They pant for air like jackals.
#
#Their eyes fail,
#because there is no vegetation.
#
## Jeremiah 14:07
#Though our iniquities testify against us,
#work for your name's sake,
#Yahweh;
#for our rebellions are many.
#
#We have sinned against you.
#
## Jeremiah 14:08
#You hope of Israel,
#its Savior in the time of trouble,
#why should you be as a foreigner in the land,
#and as a wayfaring man who turns aside to stay for a night?
#
## Jeremiah 14:09
#Why should you be like a scared man,
#as a mighty man who can’t save?
#
#Yet you,
#Yahweh,
#are in the middle of us,
#and we are called by your name.
#
#Don’t leave us.
#
## Jeremiah 14:10
#Yahweh says to this people:
#``Even so they have loved to wander.
#
#They have not restrained their feet.
#
#Therefore Yahweh does not accept them.
#
#Now he will remember their iniquity,
#and punish them for their sins.''
#
## Jeremiah 14:11
#Yahweh said to me,
#``Don’t pray for this people for their good.
#
## Jeremiah 14:12
#When they fast,
#I will not hear their cry;
#and when they offer burnt offering and meal offering,
#I will not accept them;
#but I will consume them by the sword,
#by famine,
#and by pestilence.''
#
## Jeremiah 14:13
#Then I said,
#``Ah,
#Lord Yahweh!
#
#Behold,
#the prophets tell them,
#‘You will not see the sword,
#neither will you have famine;
#but I will give you assured peace in this place.’''
#
## Jeremiah 14:14
#Then Yahweh said to me,
#``The prophets prophesy lies in my name.
#
#I didn’t send them.
#
#I didn’t command them.
#
#I didn’t speak to them.
#
#They prophesy to you a lying vision,
#divination,
#and a thing of nothing,
#and the deceit of their own heart.
#
## Jeremiah 14:15
#Therefore Yahweh says concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name,
#but I didn’t send them,
#yet they say,
#‘Sword and famine will not be in this land.’ Those prophets will be consumed by sword and famine.
#
## Jeremiah 14:16
#The people to whom they prophesy will be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword.
#
#They will have no one to bury them --- them,
#their wives,
#their sons,
#or their daughters,
#for I will pour their wickedness on them.
#
## Jeremiah 14:17
#``You shall say this word to them:
#``‘Let my eyes run down with tears night and day,

#If I go out into the field,
#then behold,
#the slain with the sword!

#If I enter into the city,
#then behold,
#those who are sick with famine!

#For both the prophet and the priest go about in the land,
#and have no knowledge.’''
#
## Jeremiah 14:19
#Have you utterly rejected Judah?
#
#Has your soul loathed Zion?
#
#Why have you struck us,
#and there is no healing for us?
#
#We looked for peace,
#but no good came;
#and for a time of healing,
#and behold,
#dismay!

## Jeremiah 14:20
#We acknowledge,

#Therefore we will wait for you;

## Jeremiah 15:01
#Then Yahweh said to me,
#``Though Moses and Samuel stood before me,
#yet my mind would not turn toward this people.
#
#Cast them out of my sight,
#and let them go out!
#
## Jeremiah 15:02
#It will happen when they ask you,
#‘Where shall we go out?’ then you shall tell them,
#‘Yahweh says:
#``Such as are for death,
#to death;
#such as are for the sword,
#to the sword;
#such as are for the famine,
#to the famine;
#and such as are for captivity,
#to captivity.''’
#
## Jeremiah 15:03
#``I will appoint over them four kinds,'' says Yahweh:
#``the sword to kill,
#the dogs to tear,
#the birds of the sky,
#and the animals of the earth,
#to devour and to destroy.
#
## Jeremiah 15:04
#I will cause them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth,
#because of Manasseh,
#the son of Hezekiah,
#king of Judah,
#for that which he did in Jerusalem.
#
## Jeremiah 15:05
#For who will have pity on you,
#Jerusalem?
#
#Who will mourn you?
#
#Who will come to ask of your welfare?
#
## Jeremiah 15:06
#You have rejected me,'' says Yahweh.
#
#``You have gone backward.
#
#Therefore I have stretched out my hand against you and destroyed you.
#
#I am weary of showing compassion.
#
## Jeremiah 15:07
#I have winnowed them with a fan in the gates of the land.
#
#I have bereaved them of children.
#
#I have destroyed my people.
#
#They didn’t return from their ways.
#
## Jeremiah 15:08
#Their widows are increased more than the sand of the seas.
#
#I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a destroyer at noonday.
#
#I have caused anguish and terrors to fall on her suddenly.
#
## Jeremiah 15:09
#She who has borne seven languishes.
#
#She has given up the spirit.
#
#Her sun has gone down while it was yet day.
#
#She has been disappointed and confounded.
#
#I will deliver their residue to the sword before their enemies,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 15:10
#Woe is me,
#my mother,
#that you have borne me,
#a man of strife,
#and a man of contention to the whole earth!
#
#I have not lent,
#neither have men lent to me;
#yet every one of them curses me.
#
## Jeremiah 15:11
#Yahweh said,
#``Most certainly I will strengthen you for good.
#
#Most certainly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.
#
## Jeremiah 15:12
#Can one break iron,
#even iron from the north,
#and bronze?
#
## Jeremiah 15:13
#I will give your substance and your treasures for a plunder without price,
#and that for all your sins,
#even in all your borders.
#
## Jeremiah 15:14
#I will make them to pass with your enemies into a land which you don’t know;
#for a fire is kindled in my anger,
#which will burn on you.''
#
## Jeremiah 15:15
#Yahweh,
#you know.
#
#Remember me,
#visit me,
#and avenge me of my persecutors.
#
#You are patient,
#so don’t take me away.
#
#Know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.
#
## Jeremiah 15:16
#Your words were found,
#and I ate them.
#
#Your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart,
#for I am called by your name,
#Yahweh,
#God of Armies.
#
## Jeremiah 15:17
#I didn’t sit in the assembly of those who make merry and rejoice.
#
#I sat alone because of your hand,
#for you have filled me with indignation.
#
## Jeremiah 15:18
#Why is my pain perpetual,
#and my wound incurable,
#which refuses to be healed?
#
#Will you indeed be to me as a deceitful brook,
#like waters that fail?
#
## Jeremiah 15:19
#Therefore Yahweh says,
#``If you return,
#then I will bring you again,
#that you may stand before me;
#and if you take out the precious from the vile,
#you will be as my mouth.
#
#They will return to you,
#but you will not return to them.
#
## Jeremiah 15:20
#I will make you to this people a fortified bronze wall.
#
#They will fight against you,
#but they will not prevail against you;
#for I am with you to save you and to deliver you,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 15:21
#``I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked,
#and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.''
#
## Jeremiah 16:01
#Then Yahweh's word came to me,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 16:02
#``You shall not take a wife,
#neither shall you have sons or daughters,
#in this place.''
#
## Jeremiah 16:03
#For Yahweh says concerning the sons and concerning the daughters who are born in this place,
#and concerning their mothers who bore them,
#and concerning their fathers who became their father in this land:
#
## Jeremiah 16:04
#``They will die grievous deaths.
#
#They will not be lamented,
#neither will they be buried.
#
#They will be as dung on the surface of the ground.
#
#They will be consumed by the sword and by famine.
#
#Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.''
#
## Jeremiah 16:05
#For Yahweh says,
#``Don’t enter into the house of mourning.
#
#Don’t go to lament.
#
#Don’t bemoan them,
#for I have taken away my peace from this people,'' says Yahweh,
#``even loving kindness and tender mercies.
#
## Jeremiah 16:06
#Both great and small will die in this land.
#
#They will not be buried.
#
#Men won’t lament for them,
#cut themselves,
#or make themselves bald for them.
#
## Jeremiah 16:07
#Men won’t break bread for them in mourning,
#to comfort them for the dead.
#
#Men won’t give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
#
## Jeremiah 16:08
#``You shall not go into the house of feasting to sit with them,
#to eat and to drink.''
#
## Jeremiah 16:09
#For Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel says:
#``Behold,
#I will cause to cease out of this place,
#before your eyes and in your days,
#the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness,
#the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride.
#
## Jeremiah 16:10
#It will happen,
#when you tell this people all these words,
#and they ask you,
#‘Why has Yahweh pronounced all this great evil against us?’ or ‘What is our iniquity?’ or ‘What is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?’
#
## Jeremiah 16:11
#then you shall tell them,
#‘Because your fathers have forsaken me,’ says Yahweh,
#‘and have walked after other gods,
#have served them,
#have worshiped them,
#have forsaken me,
#and have not kept my law.
#
## Jeremiah 16:12
#You have done evil more than your fathers,
#for behold,
#you each walk after the stubbornness of his evil heart,
#so that you don’t listen to me.
#
## Jeremiah 16:13
#Therefore I will cast you out of this land into the land that you have not known,
#neither you nor your fathers.
#
#There you will serve other gods day and night,
#for I will show you no favor.’
#
## Jeremiah 16:14
#``Therefore behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that it will no more be said,
#‘As Yahweh lives,
#who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’
#
## Jeremiah 16:15
#but,
#‘As Yahweh lives,
#who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north,
#and from all the countries where he had driven them.’ I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.
#
## Jeremiah 16:16
#``Behold,
#I will send for many fishermen,'' says Yahweh,
#``and they will fish them up.
#
#Afterward I will send for many hunters,
#and they will hunt them from every mountain,
#from every hill,
#and out of the clefts of the rocks.
#
## Jeremiah 16:17
#For my eyes are on all their ways.
#
#They are not hidden from my face.
#
#Their iniquity isn’t concealed from my eyes.
#
## Jeremiah 16:18
#First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double,
#because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things,
#and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.''
#
## Jeremiah 16:19
#Yahweh,
#my strength,
#my stronghold,
#and my refuge in the day of affliction,
#the nations will come to you from the ends of the earth,
#and will say,
#``Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies,
#vanity and things in which there is no profit.
#
## Jeremiah 16:20
#Should a man make to himself gods which yet are no gods?''
#
## Jeremiah 16:21
#``Therefore behold,
#I will cause them to know,
#this once I will cause them to know my hand and my might.
#
#Then they will know that my name is Yahweh.''
#
## Jeremiah 17:01
#``The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron,
#and with the point of a diamond.
#
#It is engraved on the tablet of their heart,
#and on the horns of your altars.
#
## Jeremiah 17:02
#Even their children remember their altars and their Asherah poles by the green trees on the high hills.
#
## Jeremiah 17:03
#My mountain in the field,
#I will give your substance and all your treasures for a plunder,
#and your high places,
#because of sin,
#throughout all your borders.
#
## Jeremiah 17:04
#You,
#even of yourself,
#will discontinue from your heritage that I gave you.
#
#I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you don’t know,
#for you have kindled a fire in my anger which will burn forever.''
#
## Jeremiah 17:05
#Yahweh says:
#``Cursed is the man who trusts in man,
#relies on strength of flesh,
#and whose heart departs from Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 17:06
#For he will be like a bush in the desert,
#and will not see when good comes,
#but will inhabit the parched places in the wilderness,
#an uninhabited salt land.
#
## Jeremiah 17:07
#``Blessed is the man who trusts in Yahweh,
#and whose confidence is in Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 17:08
#For he will be as a tree planted by the waters,
#who spreads out its roots by the river,
#and will not fear when heat comes,
#but its leaf will be green,
#and will not be concerned in the year of drought.
#
#It won’t cease from yielding fruit.
#
## Jeremiah 17:09
#The heart is deceitful above all things and it is exceedingly corrupt.
#
#Who can know it?
#
## Jeremiah 17:10
#``I,
#Yahweh,
#search the mind.
#
#I try the heart,
#even to give every man according to his ways,
#according to the fruit of his doings.''
#
## Jeremiah 17:11
#As the partridge that sits on eggs which she has not laid,
#so is he who gets riches,
#and not by right.
#
#In the middle of his days,
#they will leave him.
#
#At his end,
#he will be a fool.
#
## Jeremiah 17:12
#A glorious throne,
#set on high from the beginning,
#is the place of our sanctuary.
#
## Jeremiah 17:13
#Yahweh,
#the hope of Israel,
#all who forsake you will be disappointed.
#
#Those who depart from me will be written in the earth,
#because they have forsaken Yahweh,
#the spring of living waters.
#
## Jeremiah 17:14
#Heal me,
#O Yahweh,
#and I will be healed.
#
#Save me,
#and I will be saved;
#for you are my praise.
#
## Jeremiah 17:15
#Behold,
#they ask me,
#``Where is Yahweh's word?
#
#Let it be fulfilled now.''
#
## Jeremiah 17:16
#As for me,
#I have not hurried from being a shepherd after you.
#
#I haven’t desired the woeful day.
#
#You know.
#
#That which came out of my lips was before your face.
#
## Jeremiah 17:17
#Don’t be a terror to me.
#
#You are my refuge in the day of evil.
#
## Jeremiah 17:18
#Let them be disappointed who persecute me,
#but don’t let me be disappointed.
#
#Let them be dismayed,
#but don’t let me be dismayed.
#
#Bring on them the day of evil,
#and destroy them with double destruction.
#
## Jeremiah 17:19
#Yahweh said this to me:
#``Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people,
#through which the kings of Judah come in and by which they go out,
#and in all the gates of Jerusalem.
#
## Jeremiah 17:20
#Tell them,
#‘Hear Yahweh's word,
#you kings of Judah,
#all Judah,
#and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
#that enter in by these gates:
#
## Jeremiah 17:21
#Yahweh says,
#``Be careful,
#and bear no burden on the Sabbath day,
#nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem.
#
## Jeremiah 17:22
#Don’t carry a burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day.
#
#Don’t do any work,
#but make the Sabbath day holy,
#as I commanded your fathers.
#
## Jeremiah 17:23
#But they didn’t listen.
#
#They didn’t turn their ear,
#but made their neck stiff,
#that they might not hear,
#and might not receive instruction.
#
## Jeremiah 17:24
#It will happen,
#if you diligently listen to me,'' says Yahweh,
#``to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day,
#but to make the Sabbath day holy,
#to do no work therein;
#
## Jeremiah 17:25
#then there will enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on David's throne,
#riding in chariots and on horses,
#they and their princes,
#the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
#and this city will remain forever.
#
## Jeremiah 17:26
#They will come from the cities of Judah,
#and from the places around Jerusalem,
#from the land of Benjamin,
#from the lowland,
#from the hill country,
#and from the South,
#bringing burnt offerings,
#sacrifices,
#meal offerings,
#and frankincense,
#and bringing sacrifices of thanksgiving to Yahweh's house.
#
## Jeremiah 17:27
#But if you will not listen to me to make the Sabbath day holy,
#and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day,
#then I will kindle a fire in its gates,
#and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
#
#It will not be quenched.''’''
#
## Jeremiah 18:01
#The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 18:02
#``Arise,
#and go down to the potter's house,
#and there I will cause you to hear my words.''
#
## Jeremiah 18:03
#Then I went down to the potter's house,
#and behold,
#he was making something on the wheels.
#
## Jeremiah 18:04
#When the vessel that he made of the clay was marred in the hand of the potter,
#he made it again another vessel,
#as seemed good to the potter to make it.
#
## Jeremiah 18:05
#Then Yahweh's word came to me,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 18:06
#``House of Israel,
#can’t I do with you as this potter?''
#
#says Yahweh.
#
#``Behold,
#as the clay in the potter's hand,
#so are you in my hand,
#house of Israel.
#
## Jeremiah 18:07
#At the instant I speak concerning a nation,
#and concerning a kingdom,
#to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it,
#
## Jeremiah 18:08
#if that nation,
#concerning which I have spoken,
#turns from their evil,
#I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.
#
## Jeremiah 18:09
#At the instant I speak concerning a nation,
#and concerning a kingdom,
#to build and to plant it,
#
## Jeremiah 18:10
#if they do that which is evil in my sight,
#that they not obey my voice,
#then I will repent of the good with which I said I would benefit them.
#
## Jeremiah 18:11
#``Now therefore,
#speak to the men of Judah,
#and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
#saying,
#‘Yahweh says:
#``Behold,
#I frame evil against you,
#and devise a plan against you.
#
#Everyone return from his evil way now,
#and amend your ways and your doings.''’
#
## Jeremiah 18:12
#But they say,
#‘It is in vain;
#for we will walk after our own plans,
#and we will each follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.’''
#
## Jeremiah 18:13
#Therefore Yahweh says:
#``Ask now among the nations,
#‘Who has heard such things?’ The virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.
#
## Jeremiah 18:14
#Will the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of the field?
#
#Will the cold waters that flow down from afar be dried up?
#
## Jeremiah 18:15
#For my people have forgotten me.
#
#They have burned incense to false gods.
#
#They have been made to stumble in their ways in the ancient paths,
#to walk in byways,
#in a way not built up,
#
## Jeremiah 18:16
#to make their land an astonishment,
#and a perpetual hissing.
#
#Everyone who passes by it will be astonished,
#and shake his head.
#
## Jeremiah 18:17
#I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy.
#
#I will show them the back,
#and not the face,
#in the day of their calamity.
#
## Jeremiah 18:18
#Then they said,
#``Come!
#
#Let's devise plans against Jeremiah;
#for the law won’t perish from the priest,
#nor counsel from the wise,
#nor the word from the prophet.
#
#Come,
#and let's strike him with the tongue,
#and let's not give heed to any of his words.''
#
## Jeremiah 18:19
#Give heed to me,
#Yahweh,
#and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.
#
## Jeremiah 18:20
#Should evil be recompensed for good?
#
#For they have dug a pit for my soul.
#
#Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them,
#to turn away your wrath from them.
#
## Jeremiah 18:21
#Therefore deliver up their children to the famine,
#and give them over to the power of the sword.
#
#Let their wives become childless and widows.
#
#Let their men be killed and their young men struck by the sword in battle.
#
## Jeremiah 18:22
#Let a cry be heard from their houses when you bring a troop suddenly on them;
#for they have dug a pit to take me and hidden snares for my feet.
#
## Jeremiah 18:23
#Yet,
#Yahweh,
#you know all their counsel against me to kill me.
#
#Don’t forgive their iniquity.
#
#Don’t blot out their sin from your sight,
#Let them be overthrown before you.
#
#Deal with them in the time of your anger.
#
## Jeremiah 19:01
#Thus said Yahweh,
#``Go,
#and buy a potter's earthen container,
#and take some of the elders of the people and of the elders of the priests;
#
## Jeremiah 19:02
#and go out to the valley of the son of Hinnom,
#which is by the entry of the gate Harsith,
#and proclaim there the words that I will tell you.
#
## Jeremiah 19:03
#Say,
#‘Hear Yahweh's word,
#kings of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem:
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel says,
#``Behold,
#I will bring evil on this place,
#which whoever hears,
#his ears will tingle.
#
## Jeremiah 19:04
#Because they have forsaken me,
#and have defiled this place,
#and have burned incense in it to other gods that they didn’t know --- they,
#their fathers,
#and the kings of Judah --- and have filled this place with the blood of innocents,
#
## Jeremiah 19:05
#and have built the high places of Baal to burn their children in the fire for burnt offerings to Baal,
#which I didn’t command,
#nor speak,
#which didn’t even enter into my mind.
#
## Jeremiah 19:06
#Therefore,
#behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that this place will no more be called ‘Topheth’,
#nor ‘The Valley of the son of Hinnom’,
#but ‘The valley of Slaughter’.
#
## Jeremiah 19:07
#``‘``I will make the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem void in this place.
#
#I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies,
#and by the hand of those who seek their life.
#
#I will give their dead bodies to be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.
#
## Jeremiah 19:08
#I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing.
#
#Everyone who passes by it will be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.
#
## Jeremiah 19:09
#I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters.
#
#They will each eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and in the distress with which their enemies,
#and those who seek their life,
#will distress them.''’
#
## Jeremiah 19:10
#``Then you shall break the container in the sight of the men who go with you,
#
## Jeremiah 19:11
#and shall tell them,
#‘Yahweh of Armies says:
#``Even so I will break this people and this city as one breaks a potter's vessel,
#that can’t be made whole again.
#
#They will bury in Topheth until there is no place to bury.
#
## Jeremiah 19:12
#This is what I will do to this place,'' says Yahweh,
#``and to its inhabitants,
#even making this city as Topheth.
#
## Jeremiah 19:13
#The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah,
#which are defiled,
#will be as the place of Topheth,
#even all the houses on whose roofs they have burned incense to all the army of the sky and have poured out drink offerings to other gods.''’''
#
## Jeremiah 19:14
#Then Jeremiah came from Topheth,
#where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy,
#and he stood in the court of Yahweh's house,
#and said to all the people:
#
## Jeremiah 19:15
#``Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel says,
#‘Behold,
#I will bring on this city and on all its towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it,
#because they have made their neck stiff,
#that they may not hear my words.’''
#
## Jeremiah 20:01
#Now Pashhur,
#the son of Immer the priest,
#who was chief officer in Yahweh's house,
#heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
#
## Jeremiah 20:02
#Then Pashhur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin,
#which was in Yahweh's house.
#
## Jeremiah 20:03
#On the next day,
#Pashhur released Jeremiah out of the stocks.
#
#Then Jeremiah said to him,
#``Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur,
#but Magormissabib.
#
## Jeremiah 20:04
#For Yahweh says,
#‘Behold,
#I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends.
#
#They will fall by the sword of their enemies,
#and your eyes will see it.
#
#I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon,
#and he will carry them captive to Babylon,
#and will kill them with the sword.
#
## Jeremiah 20:05
#Moreover I will give all the riches of this city,
#and all its gains,
#and all its precious things,
#yes,
#I will give all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies.
#
#They will make them captives,
#take them,
#and carry them to Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 20:06
#You,
#Pashhur,
#and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity.
#
#You will come to Babylon,
#and there you will die,
#and there you will be buried,
#you,
#and all your friends,
#to whom you have prophesied falsely.’''
#
## Jeremiah 20:07
#Yahweh,
#you have persuaded me,
#and I was persuaded.
#
#You are stronger than I,
#and have prevailed.
#
#I have become a laughingstock all day.
#
#Everyone mocks me.
#
## Jeremiah 20:08
#For as often as I speak,
#I cry out;
#I cry,
#``Violence and destruction!''
#
#because Yahweh's word has been made a reproach to me,
#and a derision,
#all day.
#
## Jeremiah 20:09
#If I say that I will not make mention of him,
#or speak any more in his name,
#then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones.
#
#I am weary with holding it in.
#
#I can’t.
#
## Jeremiah 20:10
#For I have heard the defaming of many:
#``Terror on every side!
#
#Denounce,
#and we will denounce him!''
#
#say all my familiar friends,
#those who watch for my fall.
#
#``Perhaps he will be persuaded,
#and we will prevail against him,
#and we will take our revenge on him.''
#
## Jeremiah 20:11
#But Yahweh is with me as an awesome mighty one.
#
#Therefore my persecutors will stumble,
#and they won’t prevail.
#
#They will be utterly disappointed because they have not dealt wisely,
#even with an everlasting dishonor which will never be forgotten.
#
## Jeremiah 20:12
#But Yahweh of Armies,
#who tests the righteous,
#who sees the heart and the mind,
#let me see your vengeance on them,
#for I have revealed my cause to you.
#
## Jeremiah 20:13
#Sing to Yahweh!
#
#Praise Yahweh,
#for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.
#
## Jeremiah 20:14
#Cursed is the day in which I was born.
#
#Don’t let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.
#
## Jeremiah 20:15
#Cursed is the man who brought news to my father,
#saying,
#``A boy is born to you,'' making him very glad.
#
## Jeremiah 20:16
#Let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew,
#and didn’t repent.
#
#Let him hear a cry in the morning,
#and shouting at noontime,
#
## Jeremiah 20:17
#because he didn’t kill me from the womb.
#
#So my mother would have been my grave,
#and her womb always great.
#
## Jeremiah 20:18
#Why did I come out of the womb to see labor and sorrow,
#that my days should be consumed with shame?
#
## Jeremiah 21:01
#The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah,
#and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah,
#the priest,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 21:02
#``Please inquire of Yahweh for us;
#for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon makes war against us.
#
#Perhaps Yahweh will deal with us according to all his wondrous works,
#that he may withdraw from us.''
#
## Jeremiah 21:03
#Then Jeremiah said to them,
#``Tell Zedekiah:
#
## Jeremiah 21:04
#‘Yahweh,
#the God of Israel says,
#``Behold,
#I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands,
#with which you fight against the king of Babylon,
#and against the Chaldeans who besiege you outside the walls;
#and I will gather them into the middle of this city.
#
## Jeremiah 21:05
#I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm,
#even in anger,
#in wrath,
#and in great indignation.
#
## Jeremiah 21:06
#I will strike the inhabitants of this city,
#both man and animal.
#
#They will die of a great pestilence.
#
## Jeremiah 21:07
#Afterward,'' says Yahweh,
#``I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah,
#his servants,
#and the people,
#even those who are left in this city from the pestilence,
#from the sword,
#and from the famine,
#into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
#and into the hand of their enemies,
#and into the hand of those who seek their life.
#
#He will strike them with the edge of the sword.
#
#He will not spare them,
#have pity,
#or have mercy.''’
#
## Jeremiah 21:08
#``You shall say to this people,
#‘Yahweh says:
#``Behold,
#I set before you the way of life and the way of death.
#
## Jeremiah 21:09
#He who remains in this city will die by the sword,
#by the famine,
#and by the pestilence,
#but he who goes out and passes over to the Chaldeans who besiege you,
#he will live,
#and he will escape with his life.
#
## Jeremiah 21:10
#For I have set my face on this city for evil,
#and not for good,'' says Yahweh.
#
#``It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon,
#and he will burn it with fire.''’
#
## Jeremiah 21:11
#``Concerning the house of the king of Judah,
#hear Yahweh's word:
#
## Jeremiah 21:12
#House of David,
#Yahweh says,
#‘Execute justice in the morning,
#and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor,
#lest my wrath go out like fire,
#and burn so that no one can quench it,
#because of the evil of your doings.
#
## Jeremiah 21:13
#Behold,
#I am against you,
#O inhabitant of the valley,
#and of the rock of the plain,’ says Yahweh.
#
#‘You that say,
#``Who would come down against us?''
#
#or,
#``Who would enter into our homes?''
#
## Jeremiah 21:14
#I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings,
#says Yahweh;
#and I will kindle a fire in her forest,
#and it will devour all that is around her.’''
#
## Jeremiah 22:01
#Yahweh said,
#``Go down to the house of the king of Judah,
#and speak this word there:
#
## Jeremiah 22:02
#‘Hear Yahweh's word,
#king of Judah,
#who sits on David's throne --- you,
#your servants,
#and your people who enter in by these gates.
#
## Jeremiah 22:03
#Yahweh says:
#``Execute justice and righteousness,
#and deliver him who is robbed out of the hand of the oppressor.
#
#Do no wrong.
#
#Do no violence to the foreigner,
#the fatherless,
#or the widow.
#
#Don’t shed innocent blood in this place.
#
## Jeremiah 22:04
#For if you do this thing indeed,
#then kings sitting on David's throne will enter in by the gates of this house,
#riding in chariots and on horses --- they,
#their servants,
#and their people.
#
## Jeremiah 22:05
#But if you will not hear these words,
#I swear by myself,'' says Yahweh,
#``that this house will become a desolation.''’''
#
## Jeremiah 22:06
#For Yahweh says concerning the house of the king of Judah:
#``You are Gilead to me,
#the head of Lebanon.
#
#Yet surely I will make you a wilderness,
#cities which are not inhabited.
#
## Jeremiah 22:07
#I will prepare destroyers against you,
#everyone with his weapons,
#and they will cut down your choice cedars,
#and cast them into the fire.
#
## Jeremiah 22:08
#``Many nations will pass by this city,
#and they will each ask his neighbor,
#‘Why has Yahweh done this to this great city?’
#
## Jeremiah 22:09
#Then they will answer,
#‘Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God,
#worshiped other gods,
#and served them.’''
#
## Jeremiah 22:10
#Don’t weep for the dead.
#
#Don’t bemoan him;
#but weep bitterly for him who goes away,
#for he will return no more,
#and not see his native country.
#
## Jeremiah 22:11
#For Yahweh says touching Shallum the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah,
#who reigned instead of Josiah his father,
#and who went out of this place:
#``He won’t return there any more.
#
## Jeremiah 22:12
#But he will die in the place where they have led him captive.
#
#He will see this land no more.''
#
## Jeremiah 22:13
#``Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness,
#and his rooms by injustice;
#who uses his neighbor's service without wages,
#and doesn’t give him his hire;
#
## Jeremiah 22:14
#who says,
#‘I will build myself a wide house and spacious rooms,’ and cuts out windows for himself,
#with a cedar ceiling,
#and painted with red.
#
## Jeremiah 22:15
#``Should you reign because you strive to excel in cedar?
#
#Didn’t your father eat and drink,
#and do justice and righteousness?
#
#Then it was well with him.
#
## Jeremiah 22:16
#He judged the cause of the poor and needy;
#so then it was well.
#
#Wasn’t this to know me?''
#
#says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 22:17
#But your eyes and your heart are only for your covetousness,
#for shedding innocent blood,
#for oppression,
#and for doing violence.''
#
## Jeremiah 22:18
#Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah:
#``They won’t lament for him,
#saying,
#‘Ah my brother!’ or,
#‘Ah sister!’ They won’t lament for him,
#saying ‘Ah lord!’ or,
#‘Ah his glory!’
#
## Jeremiah 22:19
#He will be buried with the burial of a donkey,
#drawn and cast out beyond the gates of Jerusalem.''
#
## Jeremiah 22:20
#``Go up to Lebanon,
#and cry out.
#
#Lift up your voice in Bashan,
#and cry from Abarim;
#for all your lovers have been destroyed.
#
## Jeremiah 22:21
#I spoke to you in your prosperity,
#but you said,
#‘I will not listen.’ This has been your way from your youth,
#that you didn’t obey my voice.
#
## Jeremiah 22:22
#The wind will feed all your shepherds,
#and your lovers will go into captivity.
#
#Surely then you will be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.
#
## Jeremiah 22:23
#Inhabitant of Lebanon,
#who makes your nest in the cedars,
#how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs come on you,
#the pain as of a woman in travail!
#
## Jeremiah 22:24
#``As I live,'' says Yahweh,
#``though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand,
#I would still pluck you from there.
#
## Jeremiah 22:25
#I would give you into the hand of those who seek your life,
#and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid,
#even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
#and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
#
## Jeremiah 22:26
#I will cast you out with your mother who bore you into another country,
#where you were not born;
#and there you will die.
#
## Jeremiah 22:27
#But to the land to which their soul longs to return,
#there they will not return.''
#
## Jeremiah 22:28
#Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel?
#
#Is he a vessel in which no one delights?
#
#Why are they cast out,
#he and his offspring,
#and cast into a land which they don’t know?
#
## Jeremiah 22:29
#O earth,
#earth,
#earth,
#hear Yahweh's word!
#
## Jeremiah 22:30
#Yahweh says,
#``Record this man as childless,
#a man who will not prosper in his days;
#for no more will a man of his offspring prosper,
#sitting on David's throne and ruling in Judah.''
#
## Jeremiah 23:01
#``Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!''
#
#says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 23:02
#Therefore Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#says against the shepherds who feed my people:
#``You have scattered my flock,
#driven them away,
#and have not visited them.
#
#Behold,
#I will visit on you the evil of your doings,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 23:03
#``I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I have driven them,
#and will bring them again to their folds;
#and they will be fruitful and multiply.
#
## Jeremiah 23:04
#I will set up shepherds over them who will feed them.
#
#They will no longer be afraid or dismayed,
#neither will any be lacking,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 23:05
#``Behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that I will raise to David a righteous Branch;
#and he will reign as king and deal wisely,
#and will execute justice and righteousness in the land.
#
## Jeremiah 23:06
#In his days Judah will be saved,
#and Israel will dwell safely.
#
#This is his name by which he will be called:
#Yahweh our righteousness.
#
## Jeremiah 23:07
#``Therefore,
#behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that they will no more say,
#‘As Yahweh lives,
#who brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;’
#
## Jeremiah 23:08
#but,
#‘As Yahweh lives,
#who brought up and who led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country,
#and from all the countries where I had driven them.’ Then they will dwell in their own land.''
#
## Jeremiah 23:09
#Concerning the prophets:
#My heart within me is broken.
#
#All my bones shake.
#
#I am like a drunken man,
#and like a man whom wine has overcome,
#because of Yahweh,
#and because of his holy words.
#
## Jeremiah 23:10
#``For the land is full of adulterers;
#for because of the curse the land mourns.
#
#The pastures of the wilderness have dried up.
#
#Their course is evil,
#and their might is not right;
#
## Jeremiah 23:11
#for both prophet and priest are profane.
#
#Yes,
#in my house I have found their wickedness,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 23:12
#Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness.
#
#They will be driven on,
#and fall therein;
#for I will bring evil on them,
#even the year of their visitation,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 23:13
#``I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria.
#
#They prophesied by Baal,
#and caused my people Israel to err.
#
## Jeremiah 23:14
#In the prophets of Jerusalem I have also seen a horrible thing:
#they commit adultery and walk in lies.
#
#They strengthen the hands of evildoers,
#so that no one returns from his wickedness.
#
#They have all become to me as Sodom,
#and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.''
#
## Jeremiah 23:15
#Therefore Yahweh of Armies says concerning the prophets:
#``Behold,
#I will feed them with wormwood,
#and make them drink poisoned water;
#for from the prophets of Jerusalem ungodliness has gone out into all the land.''
#
## Jeremiah 23:16
#Yahweh of Armies says,
#``Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you.
#
#They teach you vanity.
#
#They speak a vision of their own heart,
#and not out of the mouth of Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 23:17
#They say continually to those who despise me,
#‘Yahweh has said,
#``You will have peace;''’ and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say,
#‘No evil will come on you.’
#
## Jeremiah 23:18
#For who has stood in the council of Yahweh,
#that he should perceive and hear his word?
#
#Who has listened to my word,
#and heard it?
#
## Jeremiah 23:19
#Behold,
#Yahweh's storm,
#his wrath,
#has gone out.
#
#Yes,
#a whirling storm!
#
#It will burst on the head of the wicked.
#
## Jeremiah 23:20
#Yahweh's anger will not return until he has executed and performed the intents of his heart.
#
#In the latter days,
#you will understand it perfectly.
#
## Jeremiah 23:21
#I didn’t send these prophets,
#yet they ran.
#
#I didn’t speak to them,
#yet they prophesied.
#
## Jeremiah 23:22
#But if they had stood in my council,
#then they would have caused my people to hear my words,
#and would have turned them from their evil way,
#and from the evil of their doings.
#
## Jeremiah 23:23
#``Am I a God at hand,'' says Yahweh,
#``and not a God afar off?
#
## Jeremiah 23:24
#Can anyone hide himself in secret places so that I can’t see him?''
#
#says Yahweh.
#
#``Don’t I fill heaven and earth?''
#
#says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 23:25
#``I have heard what the prophets have said,
#who prophesy lies in my name,
#saying,
#‘I had a dream!
#
#I had a dream!’
#
## Jeremiah 23:26
#How long will this be in the heart of the prophets who prophesy lies,
#even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?
#
## Jeremiah 23:27
#They intend to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they each tell his neighbor,
#as their fathers forgot my name because of Baal.
#
## Jeremiah 23:28
#The prophet who has a dream,
#let him tell a dream;
#and he who has my word,
#let him speak my word faithfully.
#
#What is the straw to the wheat?''
#
#says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 23:29
#``Isn’t my word like fire?''
#
#says Yahweh;
#``and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?
#
## Jeremiah 23:30
#``Therefore behold,
#I am against the prophets,'' says Yahweh,
#``who each steal my words from his neighbor.
#
## Jeremiah 23:31
#Behold,
#I am against the prophets,'' says Yahweh,
#``who use their tongues,
#and say,
#‘He says.’
#
## Jeremiah 23:32
#Behold,
#I am against those who prophesy lying dreams,'' says Yahweh,
#``who tell them,
#and cause my people to err by their lies,
#and by their vain boasting;
#yet I didn’t send them or command them.
#
#They don’t profit this people at all,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 23:33
#``When this people,
#or the prophet,
#or a priest,
#asks you,
#saying,
#‘What is the message from Yahweh?’ Then you shall tell them,
#‘``What message?
#
#I will cast you off,'' says Yahweh.’
#
## Jeremiah 23:34
#As for the prophet,
#the priest,
#and the people,
#who say,
#‘The message from Yahweh,’ I will even punish that man and his household.
#
## Jeremiah 23:35
#You will say everyone to his neighbor,
#and everyone to his brother,
#‘What has Yahweh answered?’ and,
#‘What has Yahweh said?’
#
## Jeremiah 23:36
#You will mention the message from Yahweh no more,
#for every man's own word has become his message;
#for you have perverted the words of the living God,
#of Yahweh of Armies,
#our God.
#
## Jeremiah 23:37
#You will say to the prophet,
#‘What has Yahweh answered you?’ and,
#‘What has Yahweh spoken?’
#
## Jeremiah 23:38
#Although you say,
#‘The message from Yahweh,’ therefore Yahweh says:
#‘Because you say this word,
#``The message from Yahweh,'' and I have sent to you,
#telling you not to say,
#``The message from Yahweh,''
#
## Jeremiah 23:39
#therefore behold,
#I will utterly forget you,
#and I will cast you off with the city that I gave to you and to your fathers,
#away from my presence.
#
## Jeremiah 23:40
#I will bring an everlasting reproach on you,
#and a perpetual shame,
#which will not be forgotten.’''
#
## Jeremiah 24:01
#Yahweh showed me,
#and behold,
#two baskets of figs were set before Yahweh's temple,
#after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim,
#king of Judah,
#and the princes of Judah,
#with the craftsmen and smiths,
#from Jerusalem,
#and had brought them to Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 24:02
#One basket had very good figs,
#like the figs that are first-ripe;
#and the other basket had very bad figs,
#which could not be eaten,
#they were so bad.
#
## Jeremiah 24:03
#Then Yahweh asked me,
#``What do you see,
#Jeremiah?''
#
#I said,
#``Figs.
#
#The good figs are very good,
#and the bad are very bad,
#so bad that they can’t be eaten.''
#
## Jeremiah 24:04
#Yahweh's word came to me,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 24:05
#``Yahweh,
#the God of Israel says:
#‘Like these good figs,
#so I will regard the captives of Judah,
#whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans,
#as good.
#
## Jeremiah 24:06
#For I will set my eyes on them for good,
#and I will bring them again to this land.
#
#I will build them,
#and not pull them down.
#
#I will plant them,
#and not pluck them up.
#
## Jeremiah 24:07
#I will give them a heart to know me,
#that I am Yahweh.
#
#They will be my people,
#and I will be their God;
#for they will return to me with their whole heart.
#
## Jeremiah 24:08
#``‘As the bad figs,
#which can’t be eaten,
#they are so bad,’ surely Yahweh says,
#‘So I will give up Zedekiah the king of Judah,
#and his princes,
#and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this land,
#and those who dwell in the land of Egypt.
#
## Jeremiah 24:09
#I will even give them up to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth for evil,
#to be a reproach and a proverb,
#a taunt and a curse,
#in all places where I will drive them.

## Jeremiah 24:10
#I will send the sword,
#the famine,
#and the pestilence among them,
#until they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers.’''
#
## Jeremiah 25:01
#The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah,
#in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah (this was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon),
#
## Jeremiah 25:02
#which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah,
#and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
#
## Jeremiah 25:03
#From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon,
#king of Judah,
#even to this day,
#these twenty-three years,
#Yahweh's word has come to me,
#and I have spoken to you,
#rising up early and speaking;
#but you have not listened.
#
## Jeremiah 25:04
#Yahweh has sent to you all his servants the prophets,
#rising up early and sending them (but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear),
#
## Jeremiah 25:05
#saying,
#``Return now everyone from his evil way,
#and from the evil of your doings,
#and dwell in the land that Yahweh has given to you and to your fathers,
#from of old and even forever more.
#
## Jeremiah 25:06
#Don’t go after other gods to serve them or worship them,
#and don’t provoke me to anger with the work of your hands;
#then I will do you no harm.''
#
## Jeremiah 25:07
#``Yet you have not listened to me,'' says Yahweh,
#``that you may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.''
#
## Jeremiah 25:08
#Therefore Yahweh of Armies says:
#``Because you have not heard my words,
#
## Jeremiah 25:09
#behold,
#I will send and take all the families of the north,'' says Yahweh,
#``and I will send to Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,
#my servant,
#and will bring them against this land,
#and against its inhabitants,
#and against all these nations around.
#
#I will utterly destroy them,
#and make them an astonishment,
#and a hissing,
#and perpetual desolations.
#
## Jeremiah 25:10
#Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness,
#the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride,
#the sound of the millstones,
#and the light of the lamp.
#
## Jeremiah 25:11
#This whole land will be a desolation,
#and an astonishment;
#and these nations will serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
#
## Jeremiah 25:12
#``It will happen,
#when seventy years are accomplished,
#that I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation,'' says Yahweh,
#``for their iniquity.
#
#I will make the land of the Chaldeans desolate forever.
#
## Jeremiah 25:13
#I will bring on that land all my words which I have pronounced against it,
#even all that is written in this book,
#which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.
#
## Jeremiah 25:14
#For many nations and great kings will make bondservants of them,
#even of them.

#I will recompense them according to their deeds,

## Jeremiah 25:15
#For Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#says to me:

## Jeremiah 25:16
#They will drink,
#and reel back and forth,
#and be insane,
#because of the sword that I will send among them.''

## Jeremiah 25:17
#Then I took the cup at Yahweh's hand,
#and made all the nations to drink,

#A noise will come even to the end of the earth;
#for Yahweh has a controversy with the nations.
#
#He will enter into judgment with all flesh.
#
#As for the wicked,
#he will give them to the sword,''’ says Yahweh.''
#
## Jeremiah 25:32
#Yahweh of Armies says,
#``Behold,
#evil will go out from nation to nation,
#and a great storm will be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.''
#
## Jeremiah 25:33
#The slain of Yahweh will be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth.
#
#They won’t be lamented.
#
#They won’t be gathered or buried.
#
#They will be dung on the surface of the ground.
#
## Jeremiah 25:34
#Wail,
#you shepherds,
#and cry.
#
#Wallow in dust,
#you leader of the flock;
#for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions have fully come,
#and you will fall like fine pottery.
#
## Jeremiah 25:35
#The shepherds will have no way to flee.
#
#The leader of the flock will have no escape.
#
## Jeremiah 25:36
#A voice of the cry of the shepherds,
#and the wailing of the leader of the flock,
#for Yahweh destroys their pasture.
#
## Jeremiah 25:37
#The peaceful folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 25:38
#He has left his covert,
#as the lion;
#for their land has become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppression,
#and because of his fierce anger.
#
## Jeremiah 26:01
#In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah,
#this word came from Yahweh:
#
## Jeremiah 26:02
#``Yahweh says:
#‘Stand in the court of Yahweh's house,
#and speak to all the cities of Judah which come to worship in Yahweh's house,
#all the words that I command you to speak to them.
#
#Don’t omit a word.
#
## Jeremiah 26:03
#It may be they will listen,
#and every man turn from his evil way,
#that I may relent from the evil which I intend to do to them because of the evil of their doings.’''
#
## Jeremiah 26:04
#You shall tell them,
#``Yahweh says:
#‘If you will not listen to me,
#to walk in my law which I have set before you,
#
## Jeremiah 26:05
#to listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom I send to you,
#even rising up early and sending them --- but you have not listened ---
#
## Jeremiah 26:06
#then I will make this house like Shiloh,
#and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.’''
#
## Jeremiah 26:07
#The priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in Yahweh's house.
#
## Jeremiah 26:08
#When Jeremiah had finished speaking all that Yahweh had commanded him to speak to all the people,
#the priests and the prophets and all the people seized him,
#saying,
#``You shall surely die!
#
## Jeremiah 26:09
#Why have you prophesied in Yahweh's name,
#saying,
#‘This house will be like Shiloh,
#and this city will be desolate,
#without inhabitant?’'' All the people were crowded around Jeremiah in Yahweh's house.
#
## Jeremiah 26:10
#When the princes of Judah heard these things,
#they came up from the king's house to Yahweh's house;
#and they sat in the entry of the new gate of Yahweh's house.
#
## Jeremiah 26:11
#Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people,
#saying,
#``This man is worthy of death,
#for he has prophesied against this city,
#as you have heard with your ears.''
#
## Jeremiah 26:12
#Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people,
#saying,
#``Yahweh sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that you have heard.
#
## Jeremiah 26:13
#Now therefore amend your ways and your doings,
#and obey Yahweh your God's voice;
#then Yahweh will relent from the evil that he has pronounced against you.
#
## Jeremiah 26:14
#But as for me,
#behold,
#I am in your hand.
#
#Do with me what is good and right in your eyes.
#
## Jeremiah 26:15
#Only know for certain that if you put me to death,
#you will bring innocent blood on yourselves,
#on this city,
#and on its inhabitants;
#for in truth Yahweh has sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears.''
#
## Jeremiah 26:16
#Then the princes and all the people said to the priests and to the prophets:
#``This man is not worthy of death;
#for he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God.''
#
## Jeremiah 26:17
#Then certain of the elders of the land rose up,
#and spoke to all the assembly of the people,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 26:18
#``Micah the Morashtite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah;
#and he spoke to all the people of Judah,
#saying,
#‘Yahweh of Armies says:
#``‘Zion will be plowed as a field,
#and Jerusalem will become heaps,
#and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.’
#
## Jeremiah 26:19
#Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death?
#
#Didn’t he fear Yahweh,
#and entreat the favor of Yahweh,
#and Yahweh relented of the disaster which he had pronounced against them?
#
#We would commit great evil against our own souls that way!''
#
## Jeremiah 26:20
#There was also a man who prophesied in Yahweh's name,
#Uriah the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath Jearim;
#and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah.
#
## Jeremiah 26:21
#When Jehoiakim the king,
#with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words,
#the king sought to put him to death;
#but when Uriah heard it,
#he was afraid,
#and fled,
#and went into Egypt.
#
## Jeremiah 26:22
#Then Jehoiakim the king sent Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him into Egypt.
#
## Jeremiah 26:23
#They fetched Uriah out of Egypt and brought him to Jehoiakim the king,
#who killed him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
#
## Jeremiah 26:24
#But the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah,
#so that they didn’t give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
#
## Jeremiah 27:01
#In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah,
#this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 27:02
#Yahweh says to me:
#``Make bonds and bars,
#and put them on your neck.
#
## Jeremiah 27:03
#Then send them to the king of Edom,
#to the king of Moab,
#to the king of the children of Ammon,
#to the king of Tyre,
#and to the king of Sidon,
#by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 27:04
#Give them a command to their masters,
#saying,
#‘Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel says,
#``You shall tell your masters:
#
## Jeremiah 27:05
#‘I have made the earth,
#the men,
#and the animals that are on the surface of the earth by my great power and by my outstretched arm.
#
#I give it to whom it seems right to me.
#
## Jeremiah 27:06
#Now I have given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,
#my servant.
#
#I have also given the animals of the field to him to serve him.
#
## Jeremiah 27:07
#All the nations will serve him,
#his son,
#and his son's son,
#until the time of his own land comes.
#
#Then many nations and great kings will make him their bondservant.
#
## Jeremiah 27:08
#``‘``‘It will happen that I will punish the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
#and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon,’ says Yahweh,
#‘with the sword,
#with famine,
#and with pestilence,
#until I have consumed them by his hand.
#
## Jeremiah 27:09
#But as for you,
#don’t listen to your prophets,
#to your diviners,
#to your dreams,
#to your soothsayers,
#or to your sorcerers,
#who speak to you,
#saying,
#``You shall not serve the king of Babylon;''
#
## Jeremiah 27:10
#for they prophesy a lie to you,
#to remove you far from your land,
#so that I would drive you out,
#and you would perish.
#
## Jeremiah 27:11
#But the nation that brings their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him,
#that nation I will let remain in their own land,’ says Yahweh;
#‘and they will till it and dwell in it.’''’''
#
## Jeremiah 27:12
#I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words,
#saying,
#``Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
#and serve him and his people,
#and live.
#
## Jeremiah 27:13
#Why will you die,
#you and your people,
#by the sword,
#by the famine,
#and by the pestilence,
#as Yahweh has spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?
#
## Jeremiah 27:14
#Don’t listen to the words of the prophets who speak to you,
#saying,
#‘You shall not serve the king of Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you.
#
## Jeremiah 27:15
#For I have not sent them,'' says Yahweh,
#``but they prophesy falsely in my name;
#that I may drive you out,
#and that you may perish,
#you,
#and the prophets who prophesy to you.''
#
## Jeremiah 27:16
#Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people,
#saying,
#Yahweh says,
#``Don’t listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you,
#saying,
#‘Behold,
#the vessels of Yahweh's house will now shortly be brought again from Babylon;’ for they prophesy a lie to you.
#
## Jeremiah 27:17
#Don’t listen to them.
#
#Serve the king of Babylon,
#and live.
#
#Why should this city become a desolation?
#
## Jeremiah 27:18
#But if they are prophets,
#and if Yahweh's word is with them,
#let them now make intercession to Yahweh of Armies,
#that the vessels which are left in Yahweh's house,
#in the house of the king of Judah,
#and at Jerusalem,
#don’t go to Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 27:19
#For Yahweh of Armies says concerning the pillars,
#concerning the sea,
#concerning the bases,
#and concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,
#
## Jeremiah 27:20
#which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn’t take when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim,
#king of Judah,
#from Jerusalem to Babylon,
#and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem ---
#
## Jeremiah 27:21
#yes,
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says concerning the vessels that are left in Yahweh's house,
#and in the house of the king of Judah,
#and at Jerusalem:
#
## Jeremiah 27:22
#‘They will be carried to Babylon,
#and there they will be,
#until the day that I visit them,’ says Yahweh;
#‘then I will bring them up,
#and restore them to this place.’''
#
## Jeremiah 28:01
#That same year,
#in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,
#in the fourth year,
#in the fifth month,
#Hananiah the son of Azzur,
#the prophet,
#who was of Gibeon,
#spoke to me in Yahweh's house,
#in the presence of the priests and of all the people,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 28:02
#``Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says,
#‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 28:03
#Within two full years I will bring again into this place all the vessels of Yahweh's house that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place and carried to Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 28:04
#I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim,
#king of Judah,
#with all the captives of Judah,
#who went to Babylon,’ says Yahweh;
#‘for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.’''
#
## Jeremiah 28:05
#Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests,
#and in the presence of all the people who stood in Yahweh's house,
#
## Jeremiah 28:06
#even the prophet Jeremiah said,
#``Amen!
#
#May Yahweh do so.
#
#May Yahweh perform your words which you have prophesied,
#to bring again the vessels of Yahweh's house,
#and all those who are captives,
#from Babylon to this place.
#
## Jeremiah 28:07
#Nevertheless listen now to this word that I speak in your ears,
#and in the ears of all the people:
#
## Jeremiah 28:08
#The prophets who have been before me and before you of old prophesied against many countries,
#and against great kingdoms,
#of war,
#of evil,
#and of pestilence.
#
## Jeremiah 28:09
#As for prophet who prophesies of peace,
#when the word of the prophet happens,
#then the prophet will be known,
#that Yahweh has truly sent him.''
#
## Jeremiah 28:10
#Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck,
#and broke it.
#
## Jeremiah 28:11
#Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people,
#saying,
#``Yahweh says:
#‘Even so I will break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from off the neck of all the nations within two full years.’'' Then the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
#
## Jeremiah 28:12
#Then Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah,
#after Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 28:13
#``Go,
#and tell Hananiah,
#saying,
#‘Yahweh says,
#``You have broken the bars of wood,
#but you have made in their place bars of iron.''
#
## Jeremiah 28:14
#For Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel says,
#``I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations,
#that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;
#and they will serve him.
#
#I have also given him the animals of the field.''’''
#
## Jeremiah 28:15
#Then the prophet Jeremiah said to Hananiah the prophet,
#``Listen,
#Hananiah!
#
#Yahweh has not sent you,
#but you make this people trust in a lie.
#
## Jeremiah 28:16
#Therefore Yahweh says,
#‘Behold,
#I will send you away from off the surface of the earth.
#
#This year you will die,
#because you have spoken rebellion against Yahweh.’''
#
## Jeremiah 28:17
#So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
#
## Jeremiah 29:01
#Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of the captivity,
#and to the priests,
#to the prophets,
#and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon,
#
## Jeremiah 29:02
#(after Jeconiah the king,
#the queen mother,
#the eunuchs,
#the princes of Judah and Jerusalem,
#the craftsmen,
#and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem),
#
## Jeremiah 29:03
#by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah,
#(whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon).
#
#It said:
#
## Jeremiah 29:04
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says to all the captives whom I have caused to be carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon:
#
## Jeremiah 29:05
#``Build houses and dwell in them.
#
#Plant gardens and eat their fruit.
#
## Jeremiah 29:06
#Take wives and father sons and daughters.
#
#Take wives for your sons,
#and give your daughters to husbands,
#that they may bear sons and daughters.
#
#Multiply there,
#and don’t be diminished.
#
## Jeremiah 29:07
#Seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captive,
#and pray to Yahweh for it;
#for in its peace you will have peace.''
#
## Jeremiah 29:08
#For Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel says:
#``Don’t let your prophets who are among you and your diviners deceive you.
#
#Don’t listen to your dreams which you cause to be dreamed.
#
## Jeremiah 29:09
#For they prophesy falsely to you in my name.
#
#I have not sent them,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 29:10
#For Yahweh says,
#``After seventy years are accomplished for Babylon,
#I will visit you and perform my good word toward you,
#in causing you to return to this place.
#
## Jeremiah 29:11
#For I know the thoughts that I think toward you,'' says Yahweh,
#``thoughts of peace,
#and not of evil,
#to give you hope and a future.
#
## Jeremiah 29:12
#You shall call on me,
#and you shall go and pray to me,
#and I will listen to you.
#
## Jeremiah 29:13
#You shall seek me and find me,
#when you search for me with all your heart.
#
## Jeremiah 29:14
#I will be found by you,'' says Yahweh,
#``and I will turn again your captivity,
#and I will gather you from all the nations,
#and from all the places where I have driven you,
#says Yahweh.
#
#I will bring you again to the place from where I caused you to be carried away captive.''
#
## Jeremiah 29:15
#Because you have said,
#``Yahweh has raised us up prophets in Babylon,''
#
## Jeremiah 29:16
#Yahweh says concerning the king who sits on David's throne,
#and concerning all the people who dwell in this city,
#your brothers who haven’t gone with you into captivity,
#
## Jeremiah 29:17
#Yahweh of Armies says:
#``Behold,
#I will send on them the sword,
#the famine,
#and the pestilence,
#and will make them like rotten figs that can’t be eaten,
#they are so bad.
#
## Jeremiah 29:18
#I will pursue after them with the sword,
#with the famine,
#and with the pestilence,
#and will deliver them to be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth,
#to be an object of horror,
#an astonishment,
#a hissing,
#and a reproach among all the nations where I have driven them,
#
## Jeremiah 29:19
#because they have not listened to my words,'' says Yahweh,
#``with which I sent to them my servants the prophets,
#rising up early and sending them;
#but you would not hear,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 29:20
#Hear therefore Yahweh's word,
#all you captives whom I have sent away from Jerusalem to Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 29:21
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah,
#and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah,
#who prophesy a lie to you in my name:
#``Behold,
#I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;
#and he will kill them before your eyes.
#
## Jeremiah 29:22
#A curse will be taken up about them by all the captives of Judah who are in Babylon,
#saying,
#‘Yahweh make you like Zedekiah and like Ahab,
#whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;’
#
## Jeremiah 29:23
#because they have done foolish things in Israel,
#and have committed adultery with their neighbors’ wives,
#and have spoken words in my name falsely,
#which I didn’t command them.
#
#I am he who knows,
#and am witness,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 29:24
#Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 29:25
#``Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says,
#‘Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people who are at Jerusalem,
#and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah,
#the priest,
#and to all the priests,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 29:26
#``Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest,
#that there may be officers in Yahweh's house,
#for every man who is crazy and makes himself a prophet,
#that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.
#
## Jeremiah 29:27
#Now therefore,
#why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth,
#who makes himself a prophet to you,
#
## Jeremiah 29:28
#because he has sent to us in Babylon,
#saying,
#The captivity is long.
#
#Build houses,
#and dwell in them.
#
#Plant gardens,
#and eat their fruit?''’''
#
## Jeremiah 29:29
#Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
#
## Jeremiah 29:30
#Then Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 29:31
#``Send to all of the captives,
#saying,
#‘Yahweh says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite:
#``Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you,
#and I didn’t send him,
#and he has caused you to trust in a lie,''
#
## Jeremiah 29:32
#therefore Yahweh says,
#``Behold,
#I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his offspring.
#
#He will not have a man to dwell among this people.
#
#He won’t see the good that I will do to my people,'' says Yahweh,
#``because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh.''’''
#
## Jeremiah 30:01
#The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 30:02
#``Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#says,
#‘Write all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.
#
## Jeremiah 30:03
#For,
#behold,
#the days come,’ says Yahweh,
#‘that I will reverse the captivity of my people Israel and Judah,’ says Yahweh.
#
#‘I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers,
#and they will possess it.’''
#
## Jeremiah 30:04
#These are the words that Yahweh spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 30:05
#For Yahweh says:
#``We have heard a voice of trembling;
#a voice of fear,
#and not of peace.
#
## Jeremiah 30:06
#Ask now,
#and see whether a man travails with child.
#
#Why do I see every man with his hands on his waist,
#as a woman in travail,
#and all faces are turned pale?
#
## Jeremiah 30:07
#Alas,
#for that day is great,
#so that none is like it!
#
#It is even the time of Jacob's trouble;
#but he will be saved out of it.
#
## Jeremiah 30:08
#It will come to pass in that day,
#says Yahweh of Armies,
#that I will break his yoke from off your neck,
#and will burst your bonds.
#
#Strangers will no more make them their bondservants;
#
## Jeremiah 30:09
#but they will serve Yahweh their God,
#and David their king,
#whom I will raise up to them.
#
## Jeremiah 30:10
#Therefore don’t be afraid,
#O Jacob my servant,
#says Yahweh.
#
#Don’t be dismayed,
#Israel.
#
#For,
#behold,
#I will save you from afar,
#and save your offspring from the land of their captivity.
#
#Jacob will return,
#and will be quiet and at ease.
#
#No one will make him afraid.
#
## Jeremiah 30:11
#For I am with you,
#says Yahweh,
#to save you;
#for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you,
#but I will not make a full end of you;
#but I will correct you in measure,
#and will in no way leave you unpunished.''
#
## Jeremiah 30:12
#For Yahweh says,
#``Your hurt is incurable.
#
#Your wound is grievous.
#
## Jeremiah 30:13
#There is no one to plead your cause,
#that you may be bound up.
#
#You have no healing medicines.
#
## Jeremiah 30:14
#All your lovers have forgotten you.
#
#They don’t seek you.
#
#For I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy,
#with the chastisement of a cruel one,
#for the greatness of your iniquity,
#because your sins were increased.
#
## Jeremiah 30:15
#Why do you cry over your injury?
#
#Your pain is incurable.
#
#For the greatness of your iniquity,
#because your sins have increased,
#I have done these things to you.
#
## Jeremiah 30:16
#Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured.
#
#All your adversaries,
#everyone of them,
#will go into captivity.
#
#Those who plunder you will be plunder.
#
#I will make all who prey on you become prey.
#
## Jeremiah 30:17
#For I will restore health to you,
#and I will heal you of your wounds,'' says Yahweh,
#``because they have called you an outcast,
#saying,
#‘It is Zion,
#whom no man seeks after.’''
#
## Jeremiah 30:18
#Yahweh says:
#``Behold,
#I will reverse the captivity of Jacob's tents,
#and have compassion on his dwelling places.
#
#The city will be built on its own hill,
#and the palace will be inhabited in its own place.
#
## Jeremiah 30:19
#Thanksgiving will proceed out of them with the voice of those who make merry.
#
#I will multiply them,
#and they will not be few;
#I will also glorify them,
#and they will not be small.
#
## Jeremiah 30:20
#Their children also will be as before,
#and their congregation will be established before me.
#
#I will punish all who oppress them.
#
## Jeremiah 30:21
#Their prince will be one of them,
#and their ruler will proceed from among them.
#
#I will cause him to draw near,
#and he will approach me;
#for who is he who has had boldness to approach me?''
#
#says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 30:22
#``You shall be my people,
#and I will be your God.
#
## Jeremiah 30:23
#Behold,
#Yahweh's storm,
#his wrath,
#has gone out,
#a sweeping storm;
#it will burst on the head of the wicked.
#
## Jeremiah 30:24
#The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return until he has accomplished,
#and until he has performed the intentions of his heart.
#
#In the latter days you will understand it.''
#
## Jeremiah 31:01
#``At that time,'' says Yahweh,
#``I will be the God of all the families of Israel,
#and they will be my people.''
#
## Jeremiah 31:02
#Yahweh says,
#``The people who survive the sword found favor in the wilderness;
#even Israel,
#when I went to cause him to rest.''
#
## Jeremiah 31:03
#Yahweh appeared of old to me,
#saying,
#``Yes,
#I have loved you with an everlasting love.
#
#Therefore I have drawn you with loving kindness.
#
## Jeremiah 31:04
#I will build you again,
#and you will be built,
#O virgin of Israel.
#
#You will again be adorned with your tambourines,
#and will go out in the dances of those who make merry.
#
## Jeremiah 31:05
#Again you will plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria.
#
#The planters will plant,
#and will enjoy its fruit.
#
## Jeremiah 31:06
#For there will be a day that the watchmen on the hills of Ephraim cry,
#‘Arise!
#
#Let's go up to Zion to Yahweh our God.’''
#
## Jeremiah 31:07
#For Yahweh says,
#``Sing with gladness for Jacob,
#and shout for the chief of the nations.
#
#Publish,
#praise,
#and say,
#‘Yahweh,
#save your people,
#the remnant of Israel!’
#
## Jeremiah 31:08
#Behold,
#I will bring them from the north country,
#and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth,
#along with the blind and the lame,
#the woman with child and her who travails with child together.
#
#They will return as a great company.
#
## Jeremiah 31:09
#They will come with weeping.
#
#I will lead them with petitions.
#
#I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters,
#in a straight way in which they won’t stumble;
#for I am a father to Israel.
#
#Ephraim is my firstborn.
#
## Jeremiah 31:10
#``Hear Yahweh's word,
#you nations,
#and declare it in the distant islands.
#
#Say,
#‘He who scattered Israel will gather him,
#and keep him,
#as a shepherd does his flock.’
#
## Jeremiah 31:11
#For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob,
#and redeemed him from the hand of him who was stronger than he.
#
## Jeremiah 31:12
#They will come and sing in the height of Zion,
#and will flow to the goodness of Yahweh,
#to the grain,
#to the new wine,
#to the oil,
#and to the young of the flock and of the herd.
#
#Their soul will be as a watered garden.
#
#They will not sorrow any more at all.
#
## Jeremiah 31:13
#Then the virgin will rejoice in the dance,
#the young men and the old together;
#for I will turn their mourning into joy,
#and will comfort them,
#and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
#
## Jeremiah 31:14
#I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,
#and my people will be satisfied with my goodness,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 31:15
#Yahweh says:
#``A voice is heard in Ramah,
#lamentation and bitter weeping,
#Rachel weeping for her children.
#
#She refuses to be comforted for her children,
#because they are no more.''
#
## Jeremiah 31:16
#Yahweh says:
#``Refrain your voice from weeping,
#and your eyes from tears,
#for your work will be rewarded,'' says Yahweh.
#
#``They will come again from the land of the enemy.
#
## Jeremiah 31:17
#There is hope for your latter end,'' says Yahweh.
#
#``Your children will come again to their own territory.
#
## Jeremiah 31:18
#``I have surely heard Ephraim grieving thus,
#‘You have chastised me,
#and I was chastised,
#as an untrained calf.
#
#Turn me,
#and I will be turned,
#for you are Yahweh my God.
#
## Jeremiah 31:19
#Surely after that I was turned.
#
#I repented.
#
#After that I was instructed.
#
#I struck my thigh.
#
#I was ashamed,
#yes,
#even confounded,
#because I bore the reproach of my youth.’
#
## Jeremiah 31:20
#Is Ephraim my dear son?
#
#Is he a darling child?
#
#For as often as I speak against him,
#I still earnestly remember him.
#
#Therefore my heart yearns for him.
#
#I will surely have mercy on him,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 31:21
#``Set up road signs.
#
#Make guideposts.
#
#Set your heart toward the highway,
#even the way by which you went.
#
#Turn again,
#virgin of Israel.
#
#Turn again to these your cities.
#
## Jeremiah 31:22
#How long will you go here and there,
#you backsliding daughter?
#
#For Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth:
#a woman will encompass a man.''
#
## Jeremiah 31:23
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#``Yet again they will use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities,
#when I reverse their captivity:
#‘Yahweh bless you,
#habitation of righteousness,
#mountain of holiness.’
#
## Jeremiah 31:24
#Judah and all its cities will dwell therein together,
#the farmers,
#and those who go about with flocks.
#
## Jeremiah 31:25
#For I have satiated the weary soul,
#and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.''
#
## Jeremiah 31:26
#On this I awakened,
#and saw;
#and my sleep was sweet to me.
#
## Jeremiah 31:27
#``Behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of animal.
#
## Jeremiah 31:28
#It will happen that,
#like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict,
#so I will watch over them to build and to plant,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 31:29
#``In those days they will say no more,
#``‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
#and the children's teeth are set on edge.’
#
## Jeremiah 31:30
#But everyone will die for his own iniquity.
#
#Every man who eats the sour grapes,
#his teeth will be set on edge.
#
## Jeremiah 31:31
#``Behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel,
#and with the house of Judah,
#
## Jeremiah 31:32
#not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt,
#which covenant of mine they broke,
#although I was a husband to them,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 31:33
#``But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days,'' says Yahweh:
#``I will put my law in their inward parts,
#and I will write it in their heart.
#
#I will be their God,
#and they shall be my people.
#
## Jeremiah 31:34
#They will no longer each teach his neighbor,
#and every man teach his brother,
#saying,
#‘Know Yahweh;’ for they will all know me,
#from their least to their greatest,'' says Yahweh,
#``for I will forgive their iniquity,
#and I will remember their sin no more.''
#
## Jeremiah 31:35
#Yahweh,
#who gives the sun for a light by day,
#and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,
#who stirs up the sea,
#so that its waves roar ---  Yahweh of Armies is his name,
#says:
#
## Jeremiah 31:36
#``If these ordinances depart from before me,'' says Yahweh,
#``then the offspring of Israel also will cease from being a nation before me forever.''
#
## Jeremiah 31:37
#Yahweh says:
#``If heaven above can be measured,
#and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,
#then I will also cast off all the offspring of Israel for all that they have done,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 31:38
#``Behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that the city will be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.
#
## Jeremiah 31:39
#The measuring line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb,
#and will turn toward Goah.
#
## Jeremiah 31:40
#The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes,
#and all the fields to the brook Kidron,
#to the corner of the horse gate toward the east,
#will be holy to Yahweh.
#
#It will not be plucked up or thrown down any more forever.''
#
## Jeremiah 32:01
#This is the word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah,
#which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.
#
## Jeremiah 32:02
#Now at that time the king of Babylon's army was besieging Jerusalem.
#
#Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard,
#which was in the king of Judah's house.
#
## Jeremiah 32:03
#For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up,
#saying,
#``Why do you prophesy,
#and say,
#‘Yahweh says,
#``Behold,
#I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon,
#and he will take it;
#
## Jeremiah 32:04
#and Zedekiah king of Judah won’t escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans,
#but will surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon,
#and will speak with him mouth to mouth,
#and his eyes will see his eyes;
#
## Jeremiah 32:05
#and he will bring Zedekiah to Babylon,
#and he will be there until I visit him,'' says Yahweh,
#``though you fight with the Chaldeans,
#you will not prosper?''’''
#
## Jeremiah 32:06
#Jeremiah said,
#``Yahweh's word came to me,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 32:07
#‘Behold,
#Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you,
#saying,
#``Buy my field that is in Anathoth;
#for the right of redemption is yours to buy it.''’''
#
## Jeremiah 32:08
#``So Hanamel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the guard according to Yahweh's word,
#and said to me,
#‘Please buy my field that is in Anathoth,
#which is in the land of Benjamin;
#for the right of inheritance is yours,
#and the redemption is yours.
#
#Buy it for yourself.’
#``
#Then I knew that this was Yahweh's word.
#
## Jeremiah 32:09
#I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel my uncle's son,
#and weighed him the money,
#even seventeen shekels of silver.
#
## Jeremiah 32:10
#I signed the deed,
#sealed it,
#called witnesses,
#and weighed the money in the balances to him.
#
## Jeremiah 32:11
#So I took the deed of the purchase,
#both that which was sealed,
#containing the terms and conditions,
#and that which was open;
#
## Jeremiah 32:12
#and I delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah,
#the son of Mahseiah,
#in the presence of Hanamel my uncle's son,
#and in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of the purchase,
#before all the Jews who sat in the court of the guard.
#
## Jeremiah 32:13
#``I commanded Baruch before them,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 32:14
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘Take these deeds,
#this deed of the purchase which is sealed,
#and this deed which is open,
#and put them in an earthen vessel,
#that they may last many days.’
#
## Jeremiah 32:15
#For Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel says:
#‘Houses and fields and vineyards will yet again be bought in this land.’
#
## Jeremiah 32:16
#Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah,
#I prayed to Yahweh,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 32:17
#``Ah Lord Yahweh!
#
#Behold,
#you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and by your outstretched arm.
#
#There is nothing too hard for you.
#
## Jeremiah 32:18
#You show loving kindness to thousands,
#and repay the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them.
#
#The great,
#the mighty God,
#Yahweh of Armies is your name:
#
## Jeremiah 32:19
#great in counsel,
#and mighty in work;
#whose eyes are open to all the ways of the children of men,
#to give everyone according to his ways,
#and according to the fruit of his doings;
#
## Jeremiah 32:20
#who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt,
#even to this day,
#both in Israel and among other men;
#and made yourself a name,
#as it is today;
#
## Jeremiah 32:21
#and brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs,
#with wonders,
#with a strong hand,
#with an outstretched arm,
#and with great terror;
#
## Jeremiah 32:22
#and gave them this land,
#which you swore to their fathers to give them,
#a land flowing with milk and honey.
#
## Jeremiah 32:23
#They came in and possessed it,
#but they didn’t obey your voice and didn’t walk in your law.
#
#They have done nothing of all that you commanded them to do.
#
#Therefore you have caused all this evil to come upon them.
#
## Jeremiah 32:24
#``Behold,
#siege ramps have been built against the city to take it.
#
#The city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans who fight against it,
#because of the sword,
#of the famine,
#and of the pestilence.
#
#What you have spoken has happened.
#
#Behold,
#you see it.
#
## Jeremiah 32:25
#You have said to me,
#Lord Yahweh,
#‘Buy the field for money,
#and call witnesses;’ whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.''
#
## Jeremiah 32:26
#Then Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 32:27
#``Behold,
#I am Yahweh,
#the God of all flesh.
#
#Is there anything too hard for me?
#
## Jeremiah 32:28
#Therefore Yahweh says:
#Behold,
#I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans,
#and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
#and he will take it.
#
## Jeremiah 32:29
#The Chaldeans,
#who fight against this city,
#will come and set this city on fire,
#and burn it with the houses on whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal,
#and poured out drink offerings to other gods,
#to provoke me to anger.
#
## Jeremiah 32:30
#``For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done only that which was evil in my sight from their youth;
#for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands,
#says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 32:31
#For this city has been to me a provocation of my anger and of my wrath from the day that they built it even to this day,
#so that I should remove it from before my face,
#
## Jeremiah 32:32
#because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah,
#which they have done to provoke me to anger --- they,
#their kings,
#their princes,
#their priests,
#their prophets,
#the men of Judah,
#and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
#
## Jeremiah 32:33
#They have turned their backs to me,
#and not their faces.
#
#Although I taught them,
#rising up early and teaching them,
#yet they have not listened to receive instruction.
#
## Jeremiah 32:34
#But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name,
#to defile it.
#
## Jeremiah 32:35
#They built the high places of Baal,
#which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
#to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through fire to Molech,
#which I didn’t command them.
#
#It didn’t even come into my mind,
#that they should do this abomination,
#to cause Judah to sin.''
#
## Jeremiah 32:36
#Now therefore Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#says concerning this city,
#about which you say,
#``It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword,
#by the famine,
#and by the pestilence:''
#
## Jeremiah 32:37
#``Behold,
#I will gather them out of all the countries where I have driven them in my anger,
#and in my wrath,
#and in great indignation;
#and I will bring them again to this place.
#
#I will cause them to dwell safely.
#
## Jeremiah 32:38
#Then they will be my people,
#and I will be their God.
#
## Jeremiah 32:39
#I will give them one heart and one way,
#that they may fear me forever,
#for their good and the good of their children after them.
#
## Jeremiah 32:40
#I will make an everlasting covenant with them,
#that I will not turn away from following them,
#to do them good.
#
#I will put my fear in their hearts,
#that they may not depart from me.
#
## Jeremiah 32:41
#Yes,
#I will rejoice over them to do them good,
#and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.''
#
## Jeremiah 32:42
#For Yahweh says:
#``Just as I have brought all this great evil on this people,
#so I will bring on them all the good that I have promised them.
#
## Jeremiah 32:43
#Fields will be bought in this land,
#about which you say,
#‘It is desolate,
#without man or animal.
#
#It is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.’
#
## Jeremiah 32:44
#Men will buy fields for money,
#sign the deeds,
#seal them,
#and call witnesses,
#in the land of Benjamin,
#and in the places around Jerusalem,
#in the cities of Judah,
#in the cities of the hill country,
#in the cities of the lowland,
#and in the cities of the South;
#for I will cause their captivity to be reversed,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 33:01
#Moreover Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah the second time,
#while he was still locked up in the court of the guard,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 33:02
#``Yahweh who does it,
#Yahweh who forms it to establish it --- Yahweh is his name,
#says:
#
## Jeremiah 33:03
#‘Call to me,
#and I will answer you,
#and will show you great and difficult things,
#which you don’t know.’
#
## Jeremiah 33:04
#For Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#says concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah,
#which are broken down to make a defense against the mounds and against the sword:
#
## Jeremiah 33:05
#‘While men come to fight with the Chaldeans,
#and to fill them with the dead bodies of men,
#whom I have killed in my anger and in my wrath,
#and for all whose wickedness I have hidden my face from this city,
#
## Jeremiah 33:06
#behold,
#I will bring it health and healing,
#and I will cure them;
#and I will reveal to them abundance of peace and truth.
#
## Jeremiah 33:07
#I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel,
#and will build them as at the first.
#
## Jeremiah 33:08
#I will cleanse them from all their iniquity by which they have sinned against me.
#
#I will pardon all their iniquities by which they have sinned against me and by which they have transgressed against me.
#
## Jeremiah 33:09
#This city will be to me for a name of joy,
#for praise,
#and for glory,
#before all the nations of the earth,
#which will hear all the good that I do to them,
#and will fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I provide to it.’''
#
## Jeremiah 33:10
#Yahweh says:
#``Yet again there will be heard in this place,
#about which you say,
#‘It is waste,
#without man and without animal,
#even in the cities of Judah,
#and in the streets of Jerusalem,
#that are desolate,
#without man and without inhabitant and without animal,’
#
## Jeremiah 33:11
#the voice of joy and the voice of gladness,
#the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride,
#the voice of those who say,
#‘Give thanks to Yahweh of Armies,
#for Yahweh is good,
#for his loving kindness endures forever;’ who bring thanksgiving into Yahweh's house.
#
#For I will cause the captivity of the land to be reversed as at the first,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 33:12
#Yahweh of Armies says:
#``Yet again there will be in this place,
#which is waste,
#without man and without animal,
#and in all its cities,
#a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
#
## Jeremiah 33:13
#In the cities of the hill country,
#in the cities of the lowland,
#in the cities of the South,
#in the land of Benjamin,
#in the places around Jerusalem,
#and in the cities of Judah,
#the flocks will again pass under the hands of him who counts them,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 33:14
#``Behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 33:15
#``In those days and at that time,
#I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David.
#
#He will execute justice and righteousness in the land.
#
## Jeremiah 33:16
#In those days Judah will be saved,
#and Jerusalem will dwell safely.
#
#This is the name by which she will be called:
#Yahweh our righteousness.''
#
## Jeremiah 33:17
#For Yahweh says:
#``David will never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel.
#
## Jeremiah 33:18
#The Levitical priests won’t lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings,
#to burn meal offerings,
#and to do sacrifice continually.''
#
## Jeremiah 33:19
#Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 33:20
#``Yahweh says:
#‘If you can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night,
#so that there will not be day and night in their time,
#
## Jeremiah 33:21
#then my covenant could also be broken with David my servant,
#that he won’t have a son to reign on his throne;
#and with the Levitical priests,
#my ministers.
#
## Jeremiah 33:22
#As the army of the sky can’t be counted,
#and the sand of the sea can’t be measured,
#so I will multiply the offspring of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me.’''
#
## Jeremiah 33:23
#Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 33:24
#``Don’t consider what this people has spoken,
#saying,
#‘Has Yahweh cast off the two families which he chose?’ Thus they despise my people,
#that they should be no more a nation before them.''
#
## Jeremiah 33:25
#Yahweh says:
#``If my covenant of day and night fails,
#if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth,
#
## Jeremiah 33:26
#then I will also cast away the offspring of Jacob,
#and of David my servant,
#so that I will not take of his offspring to be rulers over the offspring of Abraham,
#Isaac,
#and Jacob;
#for I will cause their captivity to be reversed and will have mercy on them.''
#
## Jeremiah 34:01
#The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
#with all his army,
#all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his dominion,
#and all the peoples,
#were fighting against Jerusalem and against all its cities,
#saying:
#
## Jeremiah 34:02
#``Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#says,
#‘Go,
#and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah,
#and tell him,
#Yahweh says,
#``Behold,
#I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon and he will burn it with fire.
#
## Jeremiah 34:03
#You won’t escape out of his hand,
#but will surely be taken and delivered into his hand.
#
#Your eyes will see the eyes of the king of Babylon,
#and he will speak with you mouth to mouth.
#
#You will go to Babylon.''’
#
## Jeremiah 34:04
#``Yet hear Yahweh's word,
#O Zedekiah king of Judah.
#
#Yahweh says concerning you,
#‘You won’t die by the sword.
#
## Jeremiah 34:05
#You will die in peace;
#and with the burnings of your fathers,
#the former kings who were before you,
#so they will make a burning for you.
#
#They will lament you,
#saying,
#``Ah Lord!''
#
#for I have spoken the word,’ says Yahweh.''
#
## Jeremiah 34:06
#Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,
#
## Jeremiah 34:07
#when the king of Babylon's army was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left,
#against Lachish and against Azekah;
#for these alone remained of the cities of Judah as fortified cities.
#
## Jeremiah 34:08
#The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem,
#to proclaim liberty to them,
#
## Jeremiah 34:09
#that every man should let his male servant,
#and every man his female servant,
#who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess,
#go free,
#that no one should make bondservants of them,
#of a Jew his brother.
#
## Jeremiah 34:10
#All the princes and all the people obeyed who had entered into the covenant,
#that everyone should let his male servant and everyone his female servant go free,
#that no one should make bondservants of them any more.
#
#They obeyed and let them go,
#
## Jeremiah 34:11
#but afterwards they turned,
#and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return,
#and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.
#
## Jeremiah 34:12
#Therefore Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 34:13
#``Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt,
#out of the house of bondage,
#saying:
#
## Jeremiah 34:14
#At the end of seven years,
#every man of you shall release his brother who is a Hebrew,
#who has been sold to you,
#and has served you six years.
#
#You shall let him go free from you.
#
#But your fathers didn’t listen to me,
#and didn’t incline their ear.
#
## Jeremiah 34:15
#You had now turned,
#and had done that which is right in my eyes,
#in every man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor.
#
#You had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name;
#
## Jeremiah 34:16
#but you turned and profaned my name,
#and every man caused his servant and every man his handmaid,
#whom you had let go free at their pleasure,
#to return.
#
#You brought them into subjection,
#to be to you for servants and for handmaids.’''
#
## Jeremiah 34:17
#Therefore Yahweh says:
#``You have not listened to me,
#to proclaim liberty,
#every man to his brother,
#and every man to his neighbor.
#
#Behold,
#I proclaim to you a liberty,'' says Yahweh,
#``to the sword,
#to the pestilence,
#and to the famine.
#
#I will make you be tossed back and forth among all the kingdoms of the earth.
#
## Jeremiah 34:18
#I will give the men who have transgressed my covenant,
#who have not performed the words of the covenant which they made before me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts:
#
## Jeremiah 34:19
#the princes of Judah,
#the princes of Jerusalem,
#the eunuchs,
#the priests,
#and all the people of the land,
#who passed between the parts of the calf.
#
## Jeremiah 34:20
#I will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those who seek their life.
#
#Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.
#
## Jeremiah 34:21
#``I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes into the hands of their enemies,
#into the hands of those who seek their life and into the hands of the king of Babylon's army,
#who has gone away from you.
#
## Jeremiah 34:22
#Behold,
#I will command,'' says Yahweh,
#``and cause them to return to this city.
#
#They will fight against it,
#take it,
#and burn it with fire.
#
#I will make the cities of Judah a desolation,
#without inhabitant.''
#
## Jeremiah 35:01
#The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 35:02
#``Go to the house of the Rechabites,
#and speak to them,
#and bring them into Yahweh's house,
#into one of the rooms,
#and give them wine to drink.''
#
## Jeremiah 35:03
#Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah,
#the son of Habazziniah,
#with his brothers,
#all his sons,
#and the whole house of the Rechabites;
#
## Jeremiah 35:04
#and I brought them into Yahweh's house,
#into the room of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah,
#the man of God,
#which was by the room of the princes,
#which was above the room of Maaseiah the son of Shallum,
#the keeper of the threshold.
#
## Jeremiah 35:05
#I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine,
#and cups;
#and I said to them,
#``Drink wine!''
#
## Jeremiah 35:06
#But they said,
#``We will drink no wine;
#for Jonadab the son of Rechab,
#our father,
#commanded us,
#saying,
#‘You shall drink no wine,
#neither you nor your children,
#forever.
#
## Jeremiah 35:07
#You shall not build a house,
#sow seed,
#plant a vineyard,
#or have any;
#but all your days you shall dwell in tents,
#that you may live many days in the land in which you live as nomads.’
#
## Jeremiah 35:08
#We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab,
#our father,
#in all that he commanded us,
#to drink no wine all our days,
#we,
#our wives,
#our sons,
#or our daughters;
#
## Jeremiah 35:09
#and not to build houses for ourselves to dwell in.
#
#We have no vineyard,
#field,
#or seed;
#
## Jeremiah 35:10
#but we have lived in tents,
#and have obeyed,
#and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
#
## Jeremiah 35:11
#But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up into the land,
#we said,
#‘Come!
#
#Let's go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans,
#and for fear of the army of the Syrians;
#so we will dwell at Jerusalem.’''
#
## Jeremiah 35:12
#Then Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 35:13
#``Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
#``Will you not receive instruction to listen to my words?''
#
#says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 35:14
#``The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab that he commanded his sons,
#not to drink wine,
#are performed;
#and to this day they drink none,
#for they obey their father's commandment;
#but I have spoken to you,
#rising up early and speaking,
#and you have not listened to me.
#
## Jeremiah 35:15
#I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets,
#rising up early and sending them,
#saying,
#‘Every one of you must return now from his evil way,
#amend your doings,
#and don’t go after other gods to serve them.
#
#Then you will dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers;’ but you have not inclined your ear,
#nor listened to me.
#
## Jeremiah 35:16
#The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them,
#but this people has not listened to me.''’
#
## Jeremiah 35:17
#``Therefore Yahweh,
#the God of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘Behold,
#I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them,
#because I have spoken to them,
#but they have not heard;
#and I have called to them,
#but they have not answered.’''
#
## Jeremiah 35:18
#Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites,
#``Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘Because you have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father,
#and kept all his precepts,
#and done according to all that he commanded you,’
#
## Jeremiah 35:19
#therefore Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘Jonadab the son of Rechab will not lack a man to stand before me forever.’''
#
## Jeremiah 36:01
#In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah,
#this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 36:02
#``Take a scroll of a book,
#and write in it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel,
#against Judah,
#and against all the nations,
#from the day I spoke to you,
#from the days of Josiah even to this day.
#
## Jeremiah 36:03
#It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I intend to do to them,
#that they may each return from his evil way;
#that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.''
#
## Jeremiah 36:04
#Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah;
#and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all Yahweh's words,
#which he had spoken to him,
#on a scroll of a book.
#
## Jeremiah 36:05
#Jeremiah commanded Baruch,
#saying,
#``I am restricted.
#
#I can’t go into Yahweh's house.
#
## Jeremiah 36:06
#Therefore you go,
#and read from the scroll which you have written from my mouth,
#Yahweh's words,
#in the ears of the people in Yahweh's house on the fast day.
#
#Also you shall read them in the ears of all Judah who come out of their cities.
#
## Jeremiah 36:07
#It may be they will present their supplication before Yahweh,
#and will each return from his evil way;
#for Yahweh has pronounced great anger and wrath against this people.''
#
## Jeremiah 36:08
#Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him,
#reading in the book Yahweh's words in Yahweh's house.
#
## Jeremiah 36:09
#Now in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah,
#in the ninth month,
#all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem,
#proclaimed a fast before Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 36:10
#Then Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the book in Yahweh's house,
#in the room of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe,
#in the upper court,
#at the entry of the new gate of Yahweh's house,
#in the ears of all the people.
#
## Jeremiah 36:11
#When Micaiah the son of Gemariah,
#the son of Shaphan,
#had heard out of the book all Yahweh's words,
#
## Jeremiah 36:12
#he went down into the king's house,
#into the scribe's room;
#and behold,
#all the princes were sitting there,
#Elishama the scribe,
#Delaiah the son of Shemaiah,
#Elnathan the son of Achbor,
#Gemariah the son of Shaphan,
#Zedekiah the son of Hananiah,
#and all the princes.
#
## Jeremiah 36:13
#Then Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard,
#when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
#
## Jeremiah 36:14
#Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah,
#the son of Shelemiah,
#the son of Cushi,
#to Baruch,
#saying,
#``Take in your hand the scroll in which you have read in the ears of the people,
#and come.''
#
#So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand,
#and came to them.
#
## Jeremiah 36:15
#They said to him,
#``Sit down now,
#and read it in our hearing.''
#
#So Baruch read it in their hearing.
#
## Jeremiah 36:16
#Now when they had heard all the words,
#they turned in fear one toward another,
#and said to Baruch,
#``We will surely tell the king of all these words.''
#
## Jeremiah 36:17
#They asked Baruch,
#saying,
#``Tell us now,
#how did you write all these words at his mouth?''
#
## Jeremiah 36:18
#Then Baruch answered them,
#``He dictated all these words to me with his mouth,
#and I wrote them with ink in the book.''
#
## Jeremiah 36:19
#Then the princes said to Baruch,
#``You and Jeremiah go hide.
#
#Don’t let anyone know where you are.''
#
## Jeremiah 36:20
#They went in to the king into the court,
#but they had laid up the scroll in the room of Elishama the scribe.
#
#Then they told all the words in the hearing of the king.
#
## Jeremiah 36:21
#So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll,
#and he took it out of the room of Elishama the scribe.
#
#Jehudi read it in the hearing of the king,
#and in the hearing of all the princes who stood beside the king.
#
## Jeremiah 36:22
#Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the ninth month,
#and there was a fire in the brazier burning before him.
#
## Jeremiah 36:23
#When Jehudi had read three or four columns,
#the king cut it with the penknife,
#and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier,
#until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
#
## Jeremiah 36:24
#The king and his servants who heard all these words were not afraid,
#and didn’t tear their garments.
#
## Jeremiah 36:25
#Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll;
#but he would not listen to them.
#
## Jeremiah 36:26
#The king commanded Jerahmeel the king's son,
#and Seraiah the son of Azriel,
#and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel,
#to arrest Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet;
#but Yahweh hid them.
#
## Jeremiah 36:27
#Then Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah,
#after the king had burned the scroll,
#and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 36:28
#``Take again another scroll,
#and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll,
#which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
#
## Jeremiah 36:29
#Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say,
#‘Yahweh says:
#``You have burned this scroll,
#saying,
#``Why have you written therein,
#saying,
#‘The king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land,
#and will cause to cease from there man and animal?’''’
#
## Jeremiah 36:30
#Therefore Yahweh says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah:
#``He will have no one to sit on David's throne.
#
#His dead body will be cast out in the day to the heat,
#and in the night to the frost.
#
## Jeremiah 36:31
#I will punish him,
#his offspring,
#and his servants for their iniquity.
#
#I will bring on them,
#on the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
#and on the men of Judah,
#all the evil that I have pronounced against them,
#but they didn’t listen.''’''
#
## Jeremiah 36:32
#Then Jeremiah took another scroll,
#and gave it to Baruch the scribe,
#the son of Neriah,
#who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire;
#and many similar words were added to them.
#
## Jeremiah 37:01
#Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned as king instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim,
#whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 37:02
#But neither he,
#nor his servants,
#nor the people of the land,
#listened to Yahweh's words,
#which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah.
#
## Jeremiah 37:03
#Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah,
#the priest,
#to the prophet Jeremiah,
#saying,
#``Pray now to Yahweh our God for us.''
#
## Jeremiah 37:04
#Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people,
#for they had not put him into prison.
#
## Jeremiah 37:05
#Pharaoh's army had come out of Egypt;
#and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them,
#they withdrew from Jerusalem.
#
## Jeremiah 37:06
#Then Yahweh's word came to the prophet Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 37:07
#``Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#says,
#‘You shall tell the king of Judah,
#who sent you to me to inquire of me:
#``Behold,
#Pharaoh's army,
#which has come out to help you,
#will return to Egypt into their own land.
#
## Jeremiah 37:08
#The Chaldeans will come again,
#and fight against this city.
#
#They will take it and burn it with fire.''’
#
## Jeremiah 37:09
#``Yahweh says,
#‘Don’t deceive yourselves,
#saying,
#``The Chaldeans will surely depart from us;'' for they will not depart.
#
## Jeremiah 37:10
#For though you had struck the whole army of the Chaldeans who fight against you,
#and only wounded men remained among them,
#they would each rise up in his tent and burn this city with fire.’''
#
## Jeremiah 37:11
#When the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army,
#
## Jeremiah 37:12
#then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin,
#to receive his portion there,
#in the middle of the people.
#
## Jeremiah 37:13
#When he was in Benjamin's gate,
#a captain of the guard was there,
#whose name was Irijah,
#the son of Shelemiah,
#the son of Hananiah;
#and he seized Jeremiah the prophet,
#saying,
#``You are defecting to the Chaldeans!''
#
## Jeremiah 37:14
#Then Jeremiah said,
#``That is false!
#
#I am not defecting to the Chaldeans.''
#
#But he didn’t listen to him;
#so Irijah seized Jeremiah,
#and brought him to the princes.
#
## Jeremiah 37:15
#The princes were angry with Jeremiah,
#and struck him,
#and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe;
#for they had made that the prison.
#
## Jeremiah 37:16
#When Jeremiah had come into the dungeon house and into the cells,
#and Jeremiah had remained there many days,
#
## Jeremiah 37:17
#then Zedekiah the king sent and had him brought out.
#
#The king asked him secretly in his house,
#``Is there any word from Yahweh?''
#
#Jeremiah said,
#``There is.''
#
#He also said,
#``You will be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.''
#
## Jeremiah 37:18
#Moreover Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah,
#``How have I sinned against you,
#against your servants,
#or against this people,
#that you have put me in prison?
#
## Jeremiah 37:19
#Now where are your prophets who prophesied to you,
#saying,
#‘The king of Babylon will not come against you,
#nor against this land?’
#
## Jeremiah 37:20
#Now please hear,
#my lord the king:
#please let my supplication be presented before you,
#that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe,
#lest I die there.''
#
## Jeremiah 37:21
#Then Zedekiah the king commanded,
#and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard.
#
#They gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers’ street,
#until all the bread in the city was gone.
#
#Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
#
## Jeremiah 38:01
#Shephatiah the son of Mattan,
#Gedaliah the son of Pashhur,
#Jucal the son of Shelemiah,
#and Pashhur the son of Malchijah heard the words that Jeremiah spoke to all the people,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 38:02
#``Yahweh says,
#‘He who remains in this city will die by the sword,
#by the famine,
#and by the pestilence,
#but he who goes out to the Chaldeans will live.
#
#He will escape with his life and he will live.’
#
## Jeremiah 38:03
#Yahweh says,
#‘This city will surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon,
#and he will take it.’''
#
## Jeremiah 38:04
#Then the princes said to the king,
#``Please let this man be put to death,
#because he weakens the hands of the men of war who remain in this city,
#and the hands of all the people,
#in speaking such words to them;
#for this man doesn’t seek the welfare of this people,
#but harm.''
#
## Jeremiah 38:05
#Zedekiah the king said,
#``Behold,
#he is in your hand;
#for the king can’t do anything to oppose you.''
#
## Jeremiah 38:06
#Then they took Jeremiah and threw him into the dungeon of Malchijah the king's son,
#that was in the court of the guard.
#
#They let down Jeremiah with cords.
#
#In the dungeon there was no water,
#but mire;
#and Jeremiah sank in the mire.
#
## Jeremiah 38:07
#Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian,
#a eunuch,
#who was in the king's house,
#heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king was then sitting in Benjamin's gate),
#
## Jeremiah 38:08
#Ebedmelech went out of the king's house,
#and spoke to the king,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 38:09
#``My lord the king,
#these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet,
#whom they have cast into the dungeon.
#
#He is likely to die in the place where he is,
#because of the famine;
#for there is no more bread in the city.''
#
## Jeremiah 38:10
#Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian,
#saying,
#``Take from here thirty men with you,
#and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon,
#before he dies.''
#
## Jeremiah 38:11
#So Ebedmelech took the men with him,
#and went into the house of the king under the treasury,
#and took from there rags and worn-out garments,
#and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
#
## Jeremiah 38:12
#Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah,
#``Now put these rags and worn-out garments under your armpits under the cords.''
#
#Jeremiah did so.
#
## Jeremiah 38:13
#So they lifted Jeremiah up with the cords,
#and took him up out of the dungeon;
#and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
#
## Jeremiah 38:14
#Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet to himself into the third entry that is in Yahweh's house.
#
#Then the king said to Jeremiah,
#``I will ask you something.
#
#Hide nothing from me.''
#
## Jeremiah 38:15
#Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah,
#``If I declare it to you,
#will you not surely put me to death?
#
#If I give you counsel,
#you will not listen to me.''
#
## Jeremiah 38:16
#So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah,
#saying,
#``As Yahweh lives,
#who made our souls,
#I will not put you to death,
#neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.''
#
## Jeremiah 38:17
#Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah,
#``Yahweh,
#the God of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘If you will go out to the king of Babylon's princes,
#then your soul will live,
#and this city will not be burned with fire.
#
#You will live,
#along with your house.
#
## Jeremiah 38:18
#But if you will not go out to the king of Babylon's princes,
#then this city will be given into the hand of the Chaldeans,
#and they will burn it with fire,
#and you won’t escape out of their hand.’''
#
## Jeremiah 38:19
#Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah,
#``I am afraid of the Jews who have defected to the Chaldeans,
#lest they deliver me into their hand,
#and they mock me.''
#
## Jeremiah 38:20
#But Jeremiah said,
#``They won’t deliver you.
#
#Obey,
#I beg you,
#Yahweh's voice,
#in that which I speak to you;
#so it will be well with you,
#and your soul will live.
#
## Jeremiah 38:21
#But if you refuse to go out,
#this is the word that Yahweh has shown me:
#
## Jeremiah 38:22
#‘Behold,
#all the women who are left in the king of Judah's house will be brought out to the king of Babylon's princes,
#and those women will say,
#``Your familiar friends have turned on you,
#and have prevailed over you.
#
#Your feet are sunk in the mire,
#they have turned away from you.''
#
## Jeremiah 38:23
#They will bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans.
#
#You won’t escape out of their hand,
#but will be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon.
#
#You will cause this city to be burned with fire.’''
#
## Jeremiah 38:24
#Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah,
#``Let no man know of these words,
#and you won’t die.
#
## Jeremiah 38:25
#But if the princes hear that I have talked with you,
#and they come to you,
#and tell you,
#‘Declare to us now what you have said to the king;
#don’t hide it from us,
#and we will not put you to death;
#also tell us what the king said to you;’
#
## Jeremiah 38:26
#then you shall tell them,
#‘I presented my supplication before the king,
#that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house,
#to die there.’''
#
## Jeremiah 38:27
#Then all the princes came to Jeremiah,
#and asked him;
#and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded.
#
#So they stopped speaking with him,
#for the matter was not perceived.
#
## Jeremiah 38:28
#So Jeremiah stayed in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.
#
## Jeremiah 39:01
#In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah,
#in the tenth month,
#Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem,
#and besieged it.
#
## Jeremiah 39:02
#In the eleventh year of Zedekiah,
#in the fourth month,
#the ninth day of the month,
#a breach was made in the city.
#
## Jeremiah 39:03
#All the princes of the king of Babylon came in,
#and sat in the middle gate:
#Nergal Sharezer,
#Samgarnebo,
#Sarsechim the Rabsaris,
#Nergal Sharezer the Rabmag,
#with all the rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 39:04
#When Zedekiah the king of Judah and all the men of war saw them,
#then they fled and went out of the city by night,
#by the way of the king's garden,
#through the gate between the two walls;
#and he went out toward the Arabah.
#
## Jeremiah 39:05
#But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them,
#and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho.
#
#When they had taken him,
#they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath;
#and he pronounced judgment on him.
#
## Jeremiah 39:06
#Then the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah's sons in Riblah before his eyes.
#
#The king of Babylon also killed all the nobles of Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 39:07
#Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him in fetters,
#to carry him to Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 39:08
#The Chaldeans burned the king's house and the people's houses with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
#
## Jeremiah 39:09
#Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city,
#the deserters also who fell away to him,
#and the rest of the people who remained.
#
## Jeremiah 39:10
#But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people,
#who had nothing,
#in the land of Judah,
#and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
#
## Jeremiah 39:11
#Now Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard concerning Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 39:12
#``Take him and take care of him.
#
#Do him no harm;
#but do to him even as he tells you.''
#
## Jeremiah 39:13
#So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard,
#Nebushazban,
#Rabsaris,
#and Nergal Sharezer,
#Rabmag,
#and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon
#
## Jeremiah 39:14
#sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard,
#and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
#the son of Shaphan,
#that he should bring him home.
#
#So he lived among the people.
#
## Jeremiah 39:15
#Now Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the guard,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 39:16
#``Go,
#and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian,
#saying,
#‘Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#``Behold,
#I will bring my words on this city for evil,
#and not for good;
#and they will be accomplished before you in that day.
#
## Jeremiah 39:17
#But I will deliver you in that day,'' says Yahweh;
#``and you will not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.
#
## Jeremiah 39:18
#For I will surely save you.
#
#You won’t fall by the sword,
#but you will escape with your life,
#because you have put your trust in me,'' says Yahweh.’''
#
## Jeremiah 40:01
#The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
#after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah,
#when he had taken him being bound in chains among all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were carried away captive to Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 40:02
#The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him,
#``Yahweh your God pronounced this evil on this place;
#
## Jeremiah 40:03
#and Yahweh has brought it,
#and done according as he spoke.
#
#Because you have sinned against Yahweh,
#and have not obeyed his voice,
#therefore this thing has come on you.
#
## Jeremiah 40:04
#Now,
#behold,
#I release you today from the chains which are on your hand.
#
#If it seems good to you to come with me into Babylon,
#come,
#and I will take care of you;
#but if it seems bad to you to come with me into Babylon,
#don’t.
#
#Behold,
#all the land is before you.
#
#Where it seems good and right to you to go,
#go there.''
#
## Jeremiah 40:05
#Now while he had not yet gone back,
#``Go back then,'' he said,
#``to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
#the son of Shaphan,
#whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah,
#and dwell with him among the people;
#or go wherever it seems right to you to go.''
#
#So the captain of the guard gave him food and a present,
#and let him go.
#
## Jeremiah 40:06
#Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah,
#and lived with him among the people who were left in the land.
#
## Jeremiah 40:07
#Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields,
#even they and their men,
#heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land,
#and had committed to him men,
#women,
#children,
#and of the poorest of the land,
#of those who were not carried away captive to Babylon,
#
## Jeremiah 40:08
#then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
#and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah,
#and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth,
#and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite,
#and Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite,
#they and their men came to Gedaliah to Mizpah.
#
## Jeremiah 40:09
#Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore to them and to their men,
#saying,
#``Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans.
#
#Dwell in the land,
#and serve the king of Babylon,
#and it will be well with you.
#
## Jeremiah 40:10
#As for me,
#behold,
#I will dwell at Mizpah,
#to stand before the Chaldeans who will come to us;
#but you,
#gather wine and summer fruits and oil,
#and put them in your vessels,
#and dwell in your cities that you have taken.''
#
## Jeremiah 40:11
#Likewise when all the Jews who were in Moab,
#and among the children of Ammon,
#and in Edom,
#and who were in all the countries,
#heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah,
#and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
#the son of Shaphan,
#
## Jeremiah 40:12
#then all the Jews returned out of all places where they were driven,
#and came to the land of Judah,
#to Gedaliah,
#to Mizpah,
#and gathered very much wine and summer fruits.
#
## Jeremiah 40:13
#Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah,
#and all the captains of the forces who were in the fields,
#came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
#
## Jeremiah 40:14
#and said to him,
#``Do you know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?''
#
#But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam didn’t believe them.
#
## Jeremiah 40:15
#Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly,
#saying,
#``Please let me go,
#and I will kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
#and no man will know it.
#
#Why should he take your life,
#that all the Jews who are gathered to you should be scattered,
#and the remnant of Judah perish?''
#
## Jeremiah 40:16
#But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah,
#``You shall not do this thing,
#for you speak falsely of Ishmael.''
#
## Jeremiah 41:01
#Now in the seventh month,
#Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
#the son of Elishama,
#of the royal offspring and one of the chief officers of the king,
#and ten men with him,
#came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
#and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.
#
## Jeremiah 41:02
#Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose,
#and the ten men who were with him,
#and struck Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and killed him,
#whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
#
## Jeremiah 41:03
#Ishmael also killed all the Jews who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah,
#and the Chaldean men of war who were found there.
#
## Jeremiah 41:04
#The second day after he had killed Gedaliah,
#and no man knew it,
#
## Jeremiah 41:05
#men came from Shechem,
#from Shiloh,
#and from Samaria,
#even eighty men,
#having their beards shaved and their clothes torn,
#and having cut themselves,
#with meal offerings and frankincense in their hand,
#to bring them to Yahweh's house.
#
## Jeremiah 41:06
#Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them,
#weeping all along as he went,
#and as he met them,
#he said to them,
#``Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.''
#
## Jeremiah 41:07
#It was so,
#when they came into the middle of the city,
#that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah killed them,
#and cast them into the middle of the pit,
#he,
#and the men who were with him.
#
## Jeremiah 41:08
#But ten men were found among those who said to Ishmael,
#``Don’t kill us;
#for we have stores hidden in the field,
#of wheat,
#and of barley,
#and of oil,
#and of honey.''
#
#So he stopped,
#and didn’t kill them among their brothers.
#
## Jeremiah 41:09
#Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had killed,
#by the side of Gedaliah (this was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel),
#Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were killed.
#
## Jeremiah 41:10
#Then Ishmael carried away captive all of the people who were left in Mizpah,
#even the king's daughters,
#and all the people who remained in Mizpah,
#whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
#
#Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive,
#and departed to go over to the children of Ammon.
#
## Jeremiah 41:11
#But when Johanan the son of Kareah,
#and all the captains of the forces who were with him,
#heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
#
## Jeremiah 41:12
#then they took all the men,
#and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
#and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
#
## Jeremiah 41:13
#Now when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah,
#and all the captains of the forces who were with him,
#then they were glad.
#
## Jeremiah 41:14
#So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back,
#and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
#
## Jeremiah 41:15
#But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men,
#and went to the children of Ammon.
#
## Jeremiah 41:16
#Then Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces who were with him took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
#from Mizpah,
#after he had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam --- the men of war,
#with the women,
#the children,
#and the eunuchs,
#whom he had brought back from Gibeon.
#
## Jeremiah 41:17
#They departed and lived in Geruth Chimham,
#which is by Bethlehem,
#to go to enter into Egypt
#
## Jeremiah 41:18
#because of the Chaldeans;
#for they were afraid of them,
#because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
#whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.
#
## Jeremiah 42:01
#Then all the captains of the forces,
#and Johanan the son of Kareah,
#and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah,
#and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
#came near,
#
## Jeremiah 42:02
#and said to Jeremiah the prophet,
#``Please let our supplication be presented before you,
#and pray for us to Yahweh your God,
#even for all this remnant,
#for we are left but a few of many,
#as your eyes see us,
#
## Jeremiah 42:03
#that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk,
#and the things that we should do.''
#
## Jeremiah 42:04
#Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them,
#``I have heard you.
#
#Behold,
#I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words;
#and it will happen that whatever thing Yahweh answers you,
#I will declare it to you.
#
#I will keep nothing back from you.''
#
## Jeremiah 42:05
#Then they said to Jeremiah,
#``May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us,
#if we don’t do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God sends you to tell us.
#
## Jeremiah 42:06
#Whether it is good,
#or whether it is bad,
#we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God,
#to whom we send you;
#that it may be well with us,
#when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.''
#
## Jeremiah 42:07
#After ten days,
#Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah.
#
## Jeremiah 42:08
#Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah,
#and all the captains of the forces who were with him,
#and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
#
## Jeremiah 42:09
#and said to them,
#``Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him,
#says:
#
## Jeremiah 42:10
#‘If you will still live in this land,
#then I will build you,
#and not pull you down,
#and I will plant you,
#and not pluck you up;
#for I grieve over the distress that I have brought on you.
#
## Jeremiah 42:11
#Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon,
#of whom you are afraid.
#
#Don’t be afraid of him,’ says Yahweh,
#‘for I am with you to save you,
#and to deliver you from his hand.
#
## Jeremiah 42:12
#I will grant you mercy,
#that he may have mercy on you,
#and cause you to return to your own land.
#
## Jeremiah 42:13
#``‘But if you say,
#``We will not dwell in this land,'' so that you don’t obey Yahweh your God's voice,
#
## Jeremiah 42:14
#saying,
#``No,
#but we will go into the land of Egypt,
#where we will see no war,
#nor hear the sound of the trumpet,
#nor have hunger of bread;
#and there we will dwell;''’
#
## Jeremiah 42:15
#now therefore hear Yahweh's word,
#O remnant of Judah!
#
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says,
#‘If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt,
#and go to live there,
#
## Jeremiah 42:16
#then it will happen that the sword,
#which you fear,
#will overtake you there in the land of Egypt;
#and the famine,
#about which you are afraid,
#will follow close behind you there in Egypt;
#and you will die there.
#
## Jeremiah 42:17
#So will it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to live there.
#
#They will die by the sword,
#by the famine,
#and by the pestilence.
#
#None of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.’
#
## Jeremiah 42:18
#For Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘As my anger and my wrath has been poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
#so my wrath will be poured out on you,
#when you enter into Egypt;
#and you will be an object of horror,
#an astonishment,
#a curse,
#and a reproach;
#and you will see this place no more.’
#
## Jeremiah 42:19
#``Yahweh has spoken concerning you,
#remnant of Judah,
#‘Don’t go into Egypt!’ Know certainly that I have testified to you today.
#
## Jeremiah 42:20
#For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls;
#for you sent me to Yahweh your God,
#saying,
#‘Pray for us to Yahweh our God;
#and according to all that Yahweh our God says,
#so declare to us,
#and we will do it.’
#
## Jeremiah 42:21
#I have declared it to you today;
#but you have not obeyed Yahweh your God's voice in anything for which he has sent me to you.
#
## Jeremiah 42:22
#Now therefore know certainly that you will die by the sword,
#by the famine,
#and by the pestilence in the place where you desire to go to live.''
#
## Jeremiah 43:01
#When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of Yahweh their God,
#with which Yahweh their God had sent him to them,
#even all these words,
#
## Jeremiah 43:02
#then Azariah the son of Hoshaiah,
#Johanan the son of Kareah,
#and all the proud men spoke,
#saying to Jeremiah,
#``You speak falsely.
#
#Yahweh our God has not sent you to say,
#‘You shall not go into Egypt to live there;’
#
## Jeremiah 43:03
#but Baruch the son of Neriah has turned you against us,
#to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans,
#that they may put us to death or carry us away captive to Babylon.''
#
## Jeremiah 43:04
#So Johanan the son of Kareah,
#and all the captains of the forces,
#and all the people,
#didn’t obey Yahweh's voice,
#to dwell in the land of Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 43:05
#But Johanan the son of Kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of Judah,
#who had returned from all the nations where they had been driven,
#to live in the land of Judah ---
#
## Jeremiah 43:06
#the men,
#the women,
#the children,
#the king's daughters,
#and every person who Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam,
#the son of Shaphan;
#and Jeremiah the prophet,
#and Baruch the son of Neriah.
#
## Jeremiah 43:07
#They came into the land of Egypt,
#for they didn’t obey Yahweh's voice;
#and they came to Tahpanhes.
#
## Jeremiah 43:08
#Then Yahweh's word came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 43:09
#``Take great stones in your hand and hide them in mortar in the brick work which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes,
#in the sight of the men of Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 43:10
#Tell them,
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘Behold,
#I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon,
#my servant,
#and will set his throne on these stones that I have hidden;
#and he will spread his royal pavilion over them.
#
## Jeremiah 43:11
#He will come,
#and will strike the land of Egypt;
#such as are for death will be put to death,
#and such as are for captivity to captivity,
#and such as are for the sword to the sword.
#
## Jeremiah 43:12
#I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt.
#
#He will burn them,
#and carry them away captive.
#
#He will array himself with the land of Egypt,
#as a shepherd puts on his garment;
#and he will go out from there in peace.
#
## Jeremiah 43:13
#He will also break the pillars of Beth Shemesh that is in the land of Egypt;
#and he will burn the houses of the gods of Egypt with fire.’''
#
## Jeremiah 44:01
#The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who lived in the land of Egypt,
#who lived at Migdol,
#and at Tahpanhes,
#and at Memphis,
#and in the country of Pathros,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 44:02
#``Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘You have seen all the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem,
#and on all the cities of Judah.
#
#Behold,
#today they are a desolation,
#and no man dwells in them,
#
## Jeremiah 44:03
#because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger,
#in that they went to burn incense,
#to serve other gods that they didn’t know,
#neither they,
#nor you,
#nor your fathers.
#
## Jeremiah 44:04
#However I sent to you all my servants the prophets,
#rising up early and sending them,
#saying,
#``Oh,
#don’t do this abominable thing that I hate.''
#
## Jeremiah 44:05
#But they didn’t listen and didn’t incline their ear.
#
#They didn’t turn from their wickedness,
#to stop burning incense to other gods.
#
## Jeremiah 44:06
#Therefore my wrath and my anger was poured out,
#and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem;
#and they are wasted and desolate,
#as it is today.’
#
## Jeremiah 44:07
#``Therefore now Yahweh,
#the God of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘Why do you commit great evil against your own souls,
#to cut off from yourselves man and woman,
#infant and nursing child out of the middle of Judah,
#to leave yourselves no one remaining,
#
## Jeremiah 44:08
#in that you provoke me to anger with the works of your hands,
#burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to live,
#that you may be cut off,
#and that you may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
#
## Jeremiah 44:09
#Have you forgotten the wickedness of your fathers,
#the wickedness of the kings of Judah,
#the wickedness of their wives,
#your own wickedness,
#and the wickedness of your wives which they committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
#
## Jeremiah 44:10
#They are not humbled even to this day,
#neither have they feared,
#nor walked in my law,
#nor in my statutes,
#that I set before you and before your fathers.’
#
## Jeremiah 44:11
#``Therefore Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#‘Behold,
#I will set my face against you for evil,
#even to cut off all Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 44:12
#I will take the remnant of Judah that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to live there,
#and they will all be consumed.
#
#They will fall in the land of Egypt.
#
#They will be consumed by the sword and by the famine.
#
#They will die,
#from the least even to the greatest,
#by the sword and by the famine.
#
#They will be an object of horror,
#an astonishment,
#a curse,

#
## Jeremiah 44:13
#For I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt,
#as I have punished Jerusalem,
#by the sword,
#by the famine,
#and by the pestilence;
#
## Jeremiah 44:14
#so that none of the remnant of Judah,
#who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there,
#will escape or be left to return into the land of Judah,
#to which they have a desire to return to dwell there;
#for no one will return except those who will escape.’''
#
## Jeremiah 44:15
#Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense to other gods,
#and all the women who stood by,
#a great assembly,
#even all the people who lived in the land of Egypt,
#in Pathros,
#answered Jeremiah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 44:16
#``As for the word that you have spoken to us in Yahweh's name,
#we will not listen to you.
#
## Jeremiah 44:17
#But we will certainly perform every word that has gone out of our mouth,
#to burn incense to the queen of the sky and to pour out drink offerings to her,
#as we have done,
#we and our fathers,
#our kings and our princes,
#in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem;
#for then we had plenty of food,
#and were well,
#and saw no evil.
#
## Jeremiah 44:18
#But since we stopped burning incense to the queen of the sky,
#and pouring out drink offerings to her,
#we have lacked all things,
#and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.''
#
## Jeremiah 44:19
#The women said,
#``When we burned incense to the queen of the sky and poured out drink offerings to her,
#did we make her cakes to worship her,
#and pour out drink offerings to her,
#without our husbands?''
#
## Jeremiah 44:20
#Then Jeremiah said to all the people --- to the men and to the women,
#even to all the people who had given him an answer,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 44:21
#``The incense that you burned in the cities of Judah,
#and in the streets of Jerusalem,
#you and your fathers,
#your kings and your princes,
#and the people of the land,
#didn’t Yahweh remember them,
#and didn’t it come into his mind?
#
## Jeremiah 44:22
#Thus Yahweh could no longer bear it,
#because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which you have committed.
#
#Therefore your land has become a desolation,
#an astonishment,
#and a curse,
#without inhabitant,
#as it is today.
#
## Jeremiah 44:23
#Because you have burned incense and because you have sinned against Yahweh,
#and have not obeyed Yahweh's voice,
#nor walked in his law,
#nor in his statutes,
#nor in his testimonies;
#therefore this evil has happened to you,
#as it is today.''
#
## Jeremiah 44:24
#Moreover Jeremiah said to all the people,
#including all the women,
#``Hear Yahweh's word,
#all Judah who are in the land of Egypt!
#
## Jeremiah 44:25
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says,
#‘You and your wives have both spoken with your mouths,
#and with your hands have fulfilled it,
#saying,
#``We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed,
#to burn incense to the queen of the sky,
#and to pour out drink offerings to her.''
#
#``‘Establish then your vows,
#and perform your vows.’
#
## Jeremiah 44:26
#``Therefore hear Yahweh's word,
#all Judah who dwell in the land of Egypt:
#‘Behold,
#I have sworn by my great name,’ says Yahweh,
#‘that my name will no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt,
#saying,
#``As the Lord Yahweh lives.''
#
## Jeremiah 44:27
#Behold,
#I watch over them for evil,
#and not for good;
#and all the men of Judah who are in the land of Egypt will be consumed by the sword and by the famine,
#until they are all gone.
#
## Jeremiah 44:28
#Those who escape the sword will return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah few in number.
#
#All the remnant of Judah,
#who have gone into the land of Egypt to live there,
#will know whose word will stand,
#mine or theirs.
#
## Jeremiah 44:29
#``‘This will be the sign to you,’ says Yahweh,
#‘that I will punish you in this place,
#that you may know that my words will surely stand against you for evil.’
#
## Jeremiah 44:30
#Yahweh says,
#‘Behold,
#I will give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of those who seek his life,
#just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
#who was his enemy and sought his life.’''
#
## Jeremiah 45:01
#The message that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah,
#when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah,
#in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah,
#saying,
#
## Jeremiah 45:02
#``Yahweh,
#the God of Israel,
#says to you,
#Baruch:

## Jeremiah 45:04
#``You shall tell him,

## Jeremiah 45:05

#
## Jeremiah 46:01

#
## Jeremiah 46:02
#Of Egypt:
#concerning the army of Pharaoh Necoh king of Egypt,
#which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish,
#which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon struck in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
#king of Judah.
#
## Jeremiah 46:03
#``Prepare the buckler and shield,
#and draw near to battle!
#
## Jeremiah 46:04
#Harness the horses,
#and get up,
#you horsemen,
#and stand up with your helmets.

#Polish the spears,
#put on the coats of mail.
#
## Jeremiah 46:05
#Why have I seen it?
#
#They are dismayed and are turned backward.
#
#Their mighty ones are beaten down,
#have fled in haste,
#and don’t look back.
#
#Terror is on every side,'' says Yahweh.
#
## Jeremiah 46:06
#``Don’t let the swift flee away,
#nor the mighty man escape.
#
#In the north by the river Euphrates they have stumbled and fallen.
#
## Jeremiah 46:07
#``Who is this who rises up like the Nile,
#like rivers whose waters surge?
#
## Jeremiah 46:08
#Egypt rises up like the Nile,
#like rivers whose waters surge.
#
#He says,
#‘I will rise up.
#
#I will cover the earth.
#
#I will destroy cities and its inhabitants.’
#
## Jeremiah 46:09
#Go up,
#you horses!
#
#Rage,
#you chariots!
#
#Let the mighty men go out:
#Cush and Put,
#who handle the shield;
#and the Ludim,
#who handle and bend the bow.
#
## Jeremiah 46:10
#For that day is of the Lord,
#Yahweh of Armies,
#a day of vengeance,
#that he may avenge himself of his adversaries.
#
#The sword will devour and be satiated,
#and will drink its fill of their blood;
#for the Lord,
#Yahweh of Armies,
#has a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
#
## Jeremiah 46:11
#Go up into Gilead,
#and take balm,
#virgin daughter of Egypt.
#
#You use many medicines in vain.
#
#There is no healing for you.
#
## Jeremiah 46:12
#The nations have heard of your shame,
#and the earth is full of your cry;
#for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty,
#they both fall together.''
#
## Jeremiah 46:13
#The word that Yahweh spoke to Jeremiah the prophet,
#how that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon should come and strike the land of Egypt:
#
## Jeremiah 46:14
#``Declare in Egypt,
#publish in Migdol,
#and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes;
#say,
#‘Stand up,
#and prepare,
#for the sword has devoured around you.’
#
## Jeremiah 46:15
#Why are your strong ones swept away?
#
#They didn’t stand,
#because Yahweh pushed them.
#
## Jeremiah 46:16
#He made many to stumble.
#
#Yes,
#they fell on one another.
#
#They said,
#‘Arise!
#
#Let's go again to our own people,
#and to the land of our birth,
#from the oppressing sword.’
#
## Jeremiah 46:17
#They cried there,
#‘Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise;
#he has let the appointed time pass by.’
#
## Jeremiah 46:18
#``As I live,'' says the King,
#whose name is Yahweh of Armies,
#``surely like Tabor among the mountains,
#and like Carmel by the sea,
#so he will come.
#
## Jeremiah 46:19
#You daughter who dwells in Egypt,
#furnish yourself to go into captivity;
#for Memphis will become a desolation,
#and will be burned up,
#without inhabitant.
#
## Jeremiah 46:20
#``Egypt is a very beautiful heifer;
#but destruction out of the north has come.
#
#It has come.

## Jeremiah 46:21
#Also her hired men in the middle of her are like calves of the stall,
#for they also are turned back.
#
#They have fled away together.
#
#They didn’t stand,
#for the day of their calamity has come on them,
#the time of their visitation.
#
## Jeremiah 46:22
#Its sound will go like the serpent,
#for they will march with an army,
#and come against her with axes,
#as wood cutters.
#
## Jeremiah 46:23
#They will cut down her forest,'' says Yahweh,
#``though it can’t be searched;
#because they are more than the locusts,
#and are innumerable.
#
## Jeremiah 46:24
#The daughter of Egypt will be disappointed;
#she will be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.''
#
## Jeremiah 46:25
#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#``Behold,
#I will punish Amon of No,
#and Pharaoh,
#and Egypt,
#with her gods and her kings,
#even Pharaoh,
#and those who trust in him.
#
## Jeremiah 46:26
#I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives,

#Afterwards it will be inhabited,
#as in the days of old,'' says Yahweh.

## Jeremiah 46:27
#``But don’t you be afraid,
#Jacob my servant.
#
#Don’t be dismayed,
#Israel;

#and your offspring from the land of their captivity.
#
#Jacob will return,
#and will be quiet and at ease.
#
#No one will make him afraid.
#
## Jeremiah 46:28
#Don’t be afraid,
#O Jacob my servant,'' says Yahweh,
#``for I am with you;

#but I will not make a full end of you,
#but I will correct you in measure,
#and will in no way leave you unpunished.''
#
## Jeremiah 47:01
#Yahweh's word that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines,
#before Pharaoh struck Gaza.
#
## Jeremiah 47:02
#Yahweh says:
#``Behold,
#waters rise up out of the north,
#and will become an overflowing stream,
#and will overflow the land and all that is therein,
#the city and those who dwell therein.
#
#The men will cry,
#and all the inhabitants of the land will wail.
#
## Jeremiah 47:03
#At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones,
#at the rushing of his chariots,
#at the rumbling of his wheels,
#the fathers don’t look back for their children because their hands are so feeble,
#
## Jeremiah 47:04
#because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines,
#to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains;
#for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines,
#the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.
#
## Jeremiah 47:05
#Baldness has come on Gaza;
#Ashkelon is brought to nothing.
#
#You remnant of their valley,

## Jeremiah 47:06
#``‘You sword of Yahweh,
#how long will it be before you are quiet?

#Put yourself back into your scabbard;

#and be still.’

#since Yahweh has given you a command?
#
#Against Ashkelon,

## Jeremiah 48:01
#Of Moab.

#Yahweh of Armies,
#the God of Israel,
#says:
#``Woe to Nebo!
#
#For it is laid waste.
#
#Kiriathaim is disappointed.
#
#It is taken.
#
#Misgab is put to shame and broken down.
#
## Jeremiah 48:02
#The praise of Moab is no more.
#
#In Heshbon they have devised evil against her:
#‘Come!
#
#Let's cut her off from being a nation.’ You also,
#Madmen,
#will be brought to silence.
#
#The sword will pursue you.
#
## Jeremiah 48:03
#The sound of a cry from Horonaim,
#desolation and great destruction!
#
## Jeremiah 48:04
#Moab is destroyed.
#
#Her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.
#
## Jeremiah 48:05
#For they will go up by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping.
#
#For at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.
#
## Jeremiah 48:06
#Flee!
#
#Save your lives!
#
#Be like the juniper bush in the wilderness.
#
## Jeremiah 48:07
#For,
#because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures,
#you also will be taken.
#
#Chemosh will go out into captivity,
#his priests and his princes together.
#
## Jeremiah 48:08
#The destroyer will come on every city,
#and no city will escape;
#the valley also will perish,
#and the plain will be destroyed,
#as Yahweh has spoken.

## Jeremiah 48:09
#Give wings to Moab,
#that she may fly and get herself away:
#and her cities will become a desolation,

## Jeremiah 48:10
#``Cursed is he who does the work of Yahweh negligently;

#
## Jeremiah 48:11
#``Moab has been at ease from his youth,
#and he has settled on his dregs,
#and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel,
#neither has he gone into captivity;
#therefore his taste remains in him,
#and his scent is not changed.
#
## Jeremiah 48:12
#Therefore behold,
#the days come,'' says Yahweh,
#``that I will send to him those who pour off,
#and they will pour him off;
#and they will empty his vessels,
#and break their containers in pieces.

## Jeremiah 48:13
#Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh,

## Jeremiah 48:14
#``How do you say,
#‘We are mighty men,
#and valiant men for the war’?

## Jeremiah 48:26
#``Make him drunk,

#Moab will wallow in his vomit,
#and he also will be in derision.

## Jeremiah 48:27
#For wasn’t Israel a derision to you?

#Was he found among thieves?

#For as often as you speak of him,
#you shake your head.

## Jeremiah 48:28
#You inhabitants of Moab,
#leave the cities,

#Be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.

## Jeremiah 48:29
#``We have heard of the pride of Moab.

#He is very proud in his loftiness,
#his pride,
#his arrogance,

## Jeremiah 48:31
#Therefore I will wail for Moab.

#Yes,
#I will cry out for all Moab.

## Jeremiah 48:32
#With more than the weeping of Jazer I will weep for you,

#The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruits and on your vintage.

## Jeremiah 48:33
#Gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab.

#I have caused wine to cease from the wine presses.

## Jeremiah 48:34
#From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh,
#even to Jahaz they have uttered their voice,
#from Zoar even to Horonaim,
#to Eglath Shelishiyah;
#for the waters of Nimrim will also become desolate.
#
## Jeremiah 48:35
#Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab,'' says Yahweh,
#``him who offers in the high place,
#and him who burns incense to his gods.
#
## Jeremiah 48:36
#Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like flutes,
#and my heart sounds like flutes for the men of Kir Heres.
#
#Therefore the abundance that he has gotten has perished.

## Jeremiah 48:37
#For every head is bald,
#and every beard clipped.

#There are cuttings on all the hands,
#and sackcloth on the waist.

## Jeremiah 48:38
#On all the housetops of Moab,
#and in its streets,
#there is lamentation everywhere;

## Jeremiah 48:39
#``How it is broken down!

#How they wail!

## Jeremiah 48:44
#``He who flees from the terror will fall into the pit;

## Jeremiah 48:45
#``Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;

#``Yet I will reverse the captivity of Moab in the latter days,'' says Yahweh.

#Thus far is the judgment of Moab.

## Jeremiah 49:02
#Therefore behold,

#``that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon,

#You won’t go unpunished,
#but you will surely drink.

## Jeremiah 50:07

#Their arrows will be as of an expert mighty man.

#you have spoken concerning this place,
#to cut it off,

## Jeremiah 52:02
#He did that which was evil in Yahweh's sight,
#according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

## Jeremiah 52:03
#For through Yahweh's anger this happened in Jerusalem and Judah,
#until he had cast them out from his presence.

## Jeremiah 52:04
#In the ninth year of his reign,
#in the tenth month,

#Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came,
#he and all his army,
#against Jerusalem,
#and encamped against it;
#and they built forts against it round about.

## Jeremiah 52:05
#So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

## Jeremiah 52:06
#In the fourth month,
#in the ninth day of the month,
#the famine was severe in the city,
#so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
#
## Jeremiah 52:07
#Then a breach was made in the city,
#and all the men of war fled,
#and went out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls,
#which was by the king's garden.
#
#Now the Chaldeans were against the city all around.
#
#The men of war went toward the Arabah,

## Jeremiah 52:08
#but the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king,
#and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho;
#and all his army was scattered from him.

## Jeremiah 52:09
#Then they took the king,
#and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath;

## Jeremiah 52:10
#The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes.

#He also killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah.

## Jeremiah 52:11
#He put out the eyes of Zedekiah;
#and the king of Babylon bound him in fetters,
#and carried him to Babylon,
#and put him in prison until the day of his death.
#
## Jeremiah 52:12
#Now in the fifth month,
#in the tenth day of the month,
#which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar,
#king of Babylon,
#Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard,
#who stood before the king of Babylon,
#came into Jerusalem.
#
## Jeremiah 52:13
#He burned Yahweh's house,
#and the king's house;
#and all the houses of Jerusalem,
#even every great house,
#he burned with fire.
#
## Jeremiah 52:14
#All the army of the Chaldeans,
#who were with the captain of the guard,
#broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.
#
## Jeremiah 52:15
#Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the poorest of the people,

#and those who fell away,
#who defected to the king of Babylon,
#and the rest of the multitude.

## Jeremiah 52:16
#But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.

## Jeremiah 52:17
#The Chaldeans broke the pillars of bronze that were in Yahweh's house and the bases and the bronze sea that were in Yahweh's house in pieces,
#and carried all of their bronze to Babylon.
#
## Jeremiah 52:18
#They also took away the pots,
#the shovels,
#the snuffers,
#the basins,
#the spoons,
#and all the vessels of bronze with which they ministered.
#
## Jeremiah 52:19
#The captain of the guard took away the cups,
#the fire pans,
#the basins,
#the pots,
#the lamp stands,
#the spoons,
#and the bowls;
#that which was of gold,
#as gold,
#and that which was of silver,
#as silver.
#
## Jeremiah 52:20
#They took the two pillars,
#the one sea,
#and the twelve bronze bulls that were under the bases,
#which King Solomon had made for Yahweh's house.
#
#The bronze of all these vessels was without weight.
#
## Jeremiah 52:21
#As for the pillars,
#the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits;
#and a line of twelve cubits encircled it;
#and its thickness was four fingers.
#
