A Song of Ascents.

By David.

Yahweh,
my heart isn't arrogant,
nor my eyes lofty;
nor do I concern myself with great matters,
or things too wonderful for me.

# Psalm 131:02
Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul,
like a weaned child with his mother,
like a weaned child is my soul within me.

# Psalm 131:03
Israel,
hope in Yahweh,
from this time forward and forever more.
