  Why haven't you eaten the >>sin offering<<
  in the place of the sanctuary,
  since it is most holy,

  It is unclean.

  # Leviticus 13:52

  Then the priest shall examine it,
  after the plague is washed;
  and behold,
  if the plague hasn't changed its color,
  and the plague hasn't spread,
  it is unclean;
  you shall burn it in the fire.

  It is a mildewed spot,
  whether the bareness is inside or outside.

  # Leviticus 13:56
  If the priest looks,
  and behold,
  the plague has faded after it is washed,
  then he shall tear it out of the garment,
  or out of the skin,
  or out of the warp,
  or out of the woof;
  # Leviticus 13:57
  and if it appears again in the garment,
  either in the warp,
  or in the woof,
  or in anything of skin,
  it is spreading.

  You shall burn what the plague is in with fire.

  # Leviticus 13:58
  The garment,
  either the warp,

  and it will be clean.

  He shall examine the plague;
  and behold,
  if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks,

  then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house,
  and shut up the house seven days.

  The priest shall come again on the seventh day,
  and look.

  If the plague has spread in the walls of the house,
  # Leviticus 14:40
  then the priest shall command that they take out the stones in which is the plague,
  and cast them into an unclean place outside of the city.

  # Leviticus 14:41
  He shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped all over.

  They shall pour out the mortar that they scraped off outside of the city into an unclean place.

  then the priest shall come in and look;
  and behold,
  if the plague has spread in the house,
  it is a destructive mildew in the house.

  It is unclean.

  and say to them,
  {
    This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded:

    # Leviticus 17:03
    Whatever man there is of the house of Israel who kills a bull,
    or lamb,
    or goat in the camp,
    or who kills it outside the camp,
    # Leviticus 17:04
    and hasn't brought it to the door of the Tent of Meeting to offer it as an offering to Yahweh before Yahweh's tabernacle:
    blood shall be imputed to that man.

    He has shed blood.

    That man shall be cut off from among his people.

    # Leviticus 17:05
    This is to the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices,
    which they sacrifice in the open field,
    that they may bring them to Yahweh,
    to the door of the Tent of Meeting,
    to the priest,
    and sacrifice them for sacrifices of >>peace offerings<< to Yahweh.

    # Leviticus 17:06
    The priest shall sprinkle the blood on Yahweh's altar at the door of the Tent of Meeting,
    and burn the fat for a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.

    # Leviticus 17:07
    They shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat idols,
    after which they play the prostitute.

    This shall be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.

    # Leviticus 17:10
    Any man of the house of Israel,
    or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them,
    who eats any kind of blood,
    I will set my face against that soul who eats blood,
    and will cut him off from among his people.

    # Leviticus 17:11
    For the life of the flesh is in the blood.

    I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls;
    for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life.

    # Leviticus 17:12
    Therefore I have said to the children of Israel,

    he shall pour out its blood,
    and cover it with dust.

    # Leviticus 17:14
    For as to the life of all flesh,
    its blood is with its life.

    Therefore I said to the children of Israel,
    {
      You shall not eat the blood of any kind of flesh;
      for the life of all flesh is its blood.

      Whoever eats it shall be cut off.

    # Leviticus 17:15
    Every person that eats what dies of itself,
    or that which is torn by animals,
    whether he is native-born or a foreigner,
    shall wash his clothes,
    and bathe himself in water,
    and be unclean until the evening.

    he shall not draw near:
    a blind man,
    or a lame,
    or he who has a flat nose,
    or any deformity,
    # Leviticus 21:19
    or a man who has an injured foot,
    or an injured hand,

    or hunchbacked,
    or a dwarf,
    or one who has a defect in his eye,

    or scabs,
    or who has damaged testicles.

    # Leviticus 21:21
    No man of the offspring of Aaron the priest who has a defect shall come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.

    Since he has a defect,
    he shall not come near to offer the bread of his God.

    # Leviticus 21:22
    He shall eat the bread of his God,
    both of the most holy,
    and of the holy.

    # Leviticus 21:23
    He shall not come near to the veil,
    nor come near to the altar,

# Leviticus 21:24
So Moses spoke to Aaron,
and to his sons,
and to all the children of Israel.

# Leviticus 22:01
Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,
# Leviticus 22:02
{
  Tell Aaron and his sons to separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel,
  which they make holy to me,
  and that they not profane my holy name.

  I am Yahweh.

  # Leviticus 22:03
  Tell them,
  {
    If anyone of all your offspring
    throughout your generations
    approaches the holy things
    which the children of Israel make holy to Yahweh,
    having his uncleanness on him,
    that soul shall be cut off from before me.

    I am Yahweh.

    # Leviticus 22:04
    Whoever of the offspring of Aaron is a leper or has a discharge shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean.

    Whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead,
    or a man who has a seminal emission,

    # Leviticus 22:05
    or whoever touches any creeping thing by which he may be made unclean,
    or a man from whom he may become unclean,
    whatever uncleanness he has ---

    # Leviticus 22:06
    the person that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening,
    and shall not eat of the holy things unless he bathes his body in water.

    # Leviticus 22:07
    When the sun is down,
    he shall be clean;
    and afterward he shall eat of the holy things,
    because it is his bread.

    # Leviticus 22:08
    He shall not eat that which dies of itself or is torn by animals,
    defiling himself by it.

    I am Yahweh.

    # Leviticus 22:09
    They shall therefore follow my commandment,
    lest they bear sin for it and die in it,
    if they profane it.

    I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.

    # Leviticus 22:10
    No stranger shall eat of the holy thing:
    a foreigner living with the priests,
    or a hired servant,
    shall not eat of the holy thing.

    # Leviticus 22:11
    But if a priest buys a slave,
    purchased by his money,
    he shall eat of it;
    and those who are born in his house shall eat of his bread.

    # Leviticus 22:12
    If a priest's daughter is married to an outsider,
    she shall not eat of the >>heave offering<< of the holy things.

    # Leviticus 22:13
    But if a priest's daughter is a widow,
    or divorced,
    and has no child,
    and has returned to her father's house as in her youth,
    she may eat of her father's bread;
    but no stranger shall eat any of it.

    # Leviticus 22:14
    If a man eats something holy unwittingly,
    then he shall add the fifth part of its value to it,
    and shall give the holy thing to the priest.

    # Leviticus 22:15
    The priests shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel,
    which they offer to Yahweh,

    # Leviticus 22:16
    and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt when they eat their holy things;
    for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.

    You must not offer to Yahweh that which has its testicles bruised,
    crushed,
    broken,
    or cut.

    You must not do this in your land.

    # Leviticus 22:25

Yahweh spoke to Moses,

  From the eighth day on it shall be accepted for the offering of an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

  Whether it is a cow or ewe,
  you shall not kill it and its young both in one day.

    But if he isn't able to get it back for himself,

    Nevertheless,
    in the cities of the Levites,

    and it shall be released in the Jubilee;
    for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.

    # Leviticus 25:34
    But the field of the pasture lands of their cities may not be sold,
    for it is their perpetual possession.

    # Leviticus 25:35
    If your brother has become poor,
    and his hand can't support himself among you,
    then you shall uphold him.

    He shall live with you like an alien and a temporary resident.

    # Leviticus 25:36
    Take no interest from him or profit;
    but fear your God,
    that your brother may live among you.

    # Leviticus 25:37
    You shall not lend him your money at interest,
    nor give him your food for profit.

    # Leviticus 25:38
    I am Yahweh your God,
    who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
    to give you the land of Canaan,
    and to be your God.

    # Leviticus 25:39
    If your brother has grown poor among you,
    and sells himself to you,
    you shall not make him to serve as a slave.

    # Leviticus 25:40
    As a hired servant,
    and as a temporary resident,
    he shall be with you;
    he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee.

    # Leviticus 25:41
    Then he shall go out from you,
    he and his children with him,
    and shall return to his own family,
    and to the possession of his fathers.

    # Leviticus 25:42
    For they are my servants,
    whom I brought out of the land of Egypt.

    They shall not be sold as slaves.

    # Leviticus 25:43
    You shall not rule over him with harshness,
    but shall fear your God.

    # Leviticus 25:44
    As for your male and your female slaves,
    whom you may have from the nations that are around you,
    from them you may buy male and female slaves.

    # Leviticus 25:45
    Moreover,
    of the children of the aliens who live among you,
    of them you may buy,
    and of their families who are with you,
    which they have conceived in your land;
    and they will be your property.

    # Leviticus 25:46
    You may make them an inheritance for your children after you,
    to hold for a possession.

    Of them you may take your slaves forever,
    but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule,
    one over another,
    with harshness.

    # Leviticus 25:47
    If an alien or temporary resident with you becomes rich,
    and your brother beside him has grown poor,
    and sells himself to the stranger or foreigner living among you,
    or to a member of the stranger's family,

    # Leviticus 25:48
    after he is sold he may be redeemed.

    One of his brothers may redeem him;

    # Leviticus 25:49
    or his uncle,
    or his uncle's son,
    may redeem him,
    or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him;
    or if he has grown rich,
    he may redeem himself.

    # Leviticus 25:50
    He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee.

    The price of his sale shall be according to the number of years;
    he shall be with him according to the time of a hired servant.

    # Leviticus 25:51
    If there are yet many years,
    according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.

    # Leviticus 25:52
    If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee,
    then he shall reckon with him;
    according to his years of service he shall give back the price of his redemption.

    # Leviticus 25:53
    As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him.

    He shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.

    # Leviticus 25:54
    If he isn't redeemed by these means,
    then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee:
    he and his children with him.

    # Leviticus 25:55
    For to me the children of Israel are servants;
    they are my servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt.

    I am Yahweh your God.

    # Leviticus 25:56
    Leviticus.

    # Leviticus 26:01
    You shall make for yourselves no idols,
    and you shall not raise up a carved image or a pillar,
    and you shall not place any figured stone in your land,
    to bow down to it;
    for I am Yahweh your God.

    # Leviticus 26:02
    You shall keep my Sabbaths,
    and have reverence for my sanctuary.

    I am Yahweh.

    # Leviticus 26:03
    If you walk in my statutes and keep my commandments,
    and do them,

    # Leviticus 26:04
    then I will give you your rains in their season,
    and the land shall yield its increase,
    and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

    # Leviticus 26:05
    Your threshing shall continue until the vintage,
    and the vintage shall continue until the sowing time.

    You shall eat your bread to the full,
    and dwell in your land safely.

    # Leviticus 26:06
    I will give peace in the land,
    and you shall lie down,
    and no one will make you afraid.

    I will remove evil animals out of the land,
    neither shall the sword go through your land.

    # Leviticus 26:07
    You shall chase your enemies,
    and they shall fall before you by the sword.

    # Leviticus 26:08
    Five of you shall chase a hundred,
    and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand;
    and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.

    # Leviticus 26:09
    I will have respect for you,
    make you fruitful,
    multiply you,
    and will establish my covenant with you.

    # Leviticus 26:10
    You shall eat old supplies long kept,
    and you shall move out the old because of the new.

    # Leviticus 26:11
    I will set my tent among you,
    and my soul won't abhor you.

    # Leviticus 26:12
    I will walk among you,
    and will be your God,
    and you will be my people.

    # Leviticus 26:13
    I am Yahweh your God,
    who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
    that you should not be their slaves.

    I have broken the bars of your yoke,
    and made you walk upright.

    # Leviticus 26:14
    But if you will not listen to me,
    and will not do all these commandments,

    # Leviticus 26:15
    and if you shall reject my statutes,
    and if your soul abhors my ordinances,
    so that you will not do all my commandments,
    but break my covenant,

    # Leviticus 26:16
    I also will do this to you:
    I will appoint terror over you,
    even consumption and fever,
    that shall consume the eyes,
    and make the soul to pine away.

    You will sow your seed in vain,
    for your enemies will eat it.

    # Leviticus 26:17
    I will set my face against you,
    and you will be struck before your enemies.

    Those who hate you will rule over you;
    and you will flee when no one pursues you.

    # Leviticus 26:18
    If you in spite of these things will not listen to me,
    then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.

    # Leviticus 26:19
    I will break the pride of your power,
    and I will make your sky like iron,
    and your soil like bronze.

    # Leviticus 26:20
    Your strength will be spent in vain;
    for your land won't yield its increase,
    neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit.

    # Leviticus 26:21
    If you walk contrary to me,
    and won't listen to me,
    then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.

    # Leviticus 26:22
    I will send the wild animals among you,
    which will rob you of your children,
    destroy your livestock,
    and make you few in number.

    Your roads will become desolate.

    # Leviticus 26:23
    If by these things you won't be turned back to me,
    but will walk contrary to me,

    # Leviticus 26:24
    then I will also walk contrary to you;
    and I will strike you,
    even I,
    seven times for your sins.

    # Leviticus 26:25
    I will bring a sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant.

    You will be gathered together within your cities,
    and I will send the pestilence among you.

    You will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

    # Leviticus 26:26
    When I break your staff of bread,
    ten women shall bake your bread in one oven,
    and they shall deliver your bread again by weight.

    You shall eat,
    and not be satisfied.

    # Leviticus 26:27
    If you in spite of this won't listen to me,
    but walk contrary to me,

    # Leviticus 26:28
    then I will walk contrary to you in wrath.

    I will also chastise you seven times for your sins.

    # Leviticus 26:29
    You will eat the flesh of your sons,
    and you will eat the flesh of your daughters.

    # Leviticus 26:30
    I will destroy your high places,
    and cut down your incense altars,
    and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols;
    and my soul will abhor you.

    # Leviticus 26:31
    I will lay your cities waste,
    and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation.

    I will not take delight in the sweet fragrance of your offerings.

    # Leviticus 26:32
    I will bring the land into desolation,
    and your enemies who dwell in it will be astonished at it.

    # Leviticus 26:33
    I will scatter you among the nations,
    and I will draw out the sword after you.

    Your land will be a desolation,
    and your cities shall be a waste.

    # Leviticus 26:34
    Then the land will enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate and you are in your enemies' land.

    Even then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.

    # Leviticus 26:35
    As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest,
    even the rest which it didn't have in your Sabbaths when you lived on it.

    # Leviticus 26:36
    As for those of you who are left,
    I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies.

    The sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight;
    and they shall flee,
    as one flees from the sword.

    They will fall when no one pursues.

    # Leviticus 26:37
    They will stumble over one another,
    as it were before the sword,
    when no one pursues.

    You will have no power to stand before your enemies.

    # Leviticus 26:38
    You will perish among the nations.

    The land of your enemies will eat you up.

    # Leviticus 26:39
    Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands;
    and also in the iniquities of their fathers they shall pine away with them.

    # Leviticus 26:40
    If they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers,
    in their trespass which they trespassed against me;
    and also that because they walked contrary to me,

    # Leviticus 26:41
    I also walked contrary to them,
    and brought them into the land of their enemies;
    if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled,
    and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity,
    # Leviticus 26:42
    then I will remember my covenant with Jacob,
    my covenant with Isaac,
    and also my covenant with Abraham;
    and I will remember the land.

    # Leviticus 26:43
    The land also will be left by them,
    and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them;
    and they will accept the punishment of their iniquity because they rejected my ordinances,
    and their soul abhorred my statutes.

    # Leviticus 26:44
    Yet for all that,
    when they are in the land of their enemies,
    I will not reject them,
    neither will I abhor them,
    to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them;
    for I am Yahweh their God.

    # Leviticus 26:45
    But I will for their sake remember the covenant of their ancestors,
    whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations,
    that I might be their God.

    I am Yahweh.

# Leviticus 26:46
These are the statutes,
ordinances,
and laws,
which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.

# Leviticus 26:47
Leviticus.

# Leviticus 27:01
Yahweh spoke to Moses,
saying,
# Leviticus 27:02
{
  Speak to the children of Israel,
  and say to them,
  {
    When a man consecrates a person to Yahweh in a vow,
    according to your valuation,
    # Leviticus 27:03
    your valuation of a male from twenty years old to sixty years old shall be fifty shekels of silver,
    according to the shekel of the sanctuary.

    # Leviticus 27:04
    If she is a female,
    then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.

    # Leviticus 27:05
    If the person is from five years old to twenty years old,
    then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels,
    and for a female ten shekels.

    # Leviticus 27:06
    If the person is from a month old to five years old,
    then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver,
    and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.

    # Leviticus 27:07
    If the person is from sixty years old and upward;
    if he is a male,
    then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels,
    and for a female ten shekels.

    # Leviticus 27:08
    But if he is poorer than your valuation,
    then he shall be set before the priest,
    and the priest shall assign a value to him.

    The priest shall assign a value according to his ability to pay.

    # Leviticus 27:09
    If it is an animal of which men offer an offering to Yahweh,
    all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy.

    # Leviticus 27:10
    He shall not alter it,
    nor exchange it,
    a good for a bad,
    or a bad for a good.

    If he shall at all exchange animal for animal,
    then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.

    # Leviticus 27:11
    If it is any unclean animal,
    of which they do not offer as an offering to Yahweh,
    then he shall set the animal before the priest;
    # Leviticus 27:12
    and the priest shall evaluate it,
    whether it is good or bad.

    As the priest evaluates it,
    so it shall be.

    # Leviticus 27:13
    But if he will indeed redeem it,
    then he shall add the fifth part of it to its valuation.

    # Leviticus 27:14
    When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh,
    then the priest shall evaluate it,
    whether it is good or bad.

    As the priest evaluates it,
    so it shall stand.

    # Leviticus 27:15
    If he who dedicates it will redeem his house,
    then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it,
    and it shall be his.

    # Leviticus 27:16
    If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession,
    then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it.

    The sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.

    # Leviticus 27:17
    If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee,
    according to your valuation it shall stand.

    # Leviticus 27:18
    But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee,
    then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the Year of Jubilee;
    and an abatement shall be made from your valuation.

    # Leviticus 27:19
    If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it,
    then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it,
    and it shall remain his.

    # Leviticus 27:20
    If he will not redeem the field,
    or if he has sold the field to another man,
    it shall not be redeemed any more;
    # Leviticus 27:21
    but the field,
    when it goes out in the Jubilee,
    shall be holy to Yahweh,
    as a devoted field.

    It shall be owned by the priests.

    # Leviticus 27:22
    If he dedicates a field to Yahweh which he has bought,
    which is not of the field of his possession,

    # Leviticus 27:23
    then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee;
    and he shall give your valuation on that day,
    as a holy thing to Yahweh.

    # Leviticus 27:24
    In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought,
    even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.

    # Leviticus 27:25
    All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary:
    twenty gerahs to the shekel.

    # Leviticus 27:26
    However the firstborn among animals,
    which belongs to Yahweh as a firstborn,
    no man may dedicate,
    whether an ox or a sheep.

    It is Yahweh's.

    # Leviticus 27:27
    If it is an unclean animal,
    then he shall buy it back according to your valuation,
    and shall add to it the fifth part of it;
    or if it isn't redeemed,
    then it shall be sold according to your valuation.

    # Leviticus 27:28
    Notwithstanding,
    no devoted thing that a man devotes to Yahweh of all that he has,
    whether of man or animal,
    or of the field of his possession,
    shall be sold or redeemed.

    Everything that is permanently devoted is most holy to Yahweh.

    # Leviticus 27:29
    No one devoted to destruction,
    who shall be devoted from among men,
    shall be ransomed.

    He shall surely be put to death.

    # Leviticus 27:30
    All the tithe of the land,
    whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees,
    is Yahweh's.

    It is holy to Yahweh.

    # Leviticus 27:31
    If a man redeems anything of his tithe,
    he shall add a fifth part to it.

    # Leviticus 27:32
    All the tithe of the herds or the flocks,
    whatever passes under the rod,
    the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.

    # Leviticus 27:33
    He shall not examine whether it is good or bad,
    neither shall he exchange it.

    If he exchanges it at all,
    then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy.

    It shall not be redeemed.

These are the commandments
which Yahweh commanded Moses
for the children of Israel
on Mount Sinai.
