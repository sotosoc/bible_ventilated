Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,
to the assembly of the Thessalonians
in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:

Grace to you and peace
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

# Section: We always give thanks to God
# 1Thessalonians 01:02
We always give thanks to God for all of you,
mentioning you in our prayers,
# 1Thessalonians 01:03
remembering without ceasing
  your work of faith
  and labor of love
  and perseverance of hope
in our Lord Jesus Christ,
before our God and Father.

# Section: We know, brothers loved by God
# 1Thessalonians 01:04
STARTHERE

We know, brothers loved by God,
that you are chosen,
# 1Thessalonians 01:05
and that our Good News came to you not in word only,
but also in power,
and in the Holy Spirit and with much assurance.

You know what kind of men
we showed ourselves to be among you
for your sake.

# 1Thessalonians 01:06
You became imitators of us and of the Lord,
having received the word in much affliction,
with joy of the Holy Spirit,
# 1Thessalonians 01:07
so that you became an example
to all who believe
in Macedonia and in Achaia.

# 1Thessalonians 01:08
For from you the word of the Lord has been declared,
not only in Macedonia and Achaia,
but also in every place your faith toward God has gone out,
so that we need not to say anything.

# 1Thessalonians 01:09
For they themselves report concerning us
what kind of a reception we had from you,
and how you turned to God from idols
to serve a living and true God,
# 1Thessalonians 01:10
and to wait for his Son from heaven,
whom he raised from the dead:

  Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.

# 1Thessalonians 02:01
For you yourselves know, brothers,
our visit to you wasn’t in vain,
# 1Thessalonians 02:02
but having suffered before and been shamefully treated,
as you know,
at Philippi,
we grew bold in our God
to tell you the Good News of God
in much conflict.

# 1Thessalonians 02:03
For our exhortation is not of error,
  nor of uncleanness,
  nor in deception.

# 1Thessalonians 02:04
But even as we have been approved by God
to be entrusted with the Good News,
so we speak ---
not as pleasing men,
but God, who tests our hearts.

# 1Thessalonians 02:05
For neither were we at any time found using words of flattery,
as you know,
nor a cloak of covetousness (God is witness),
# 1Thessalonians 02:06
nor seeking glory from men (neither from you nor from others),
when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Christ.

# 1Thessalonians 02:07
But we were gentle among you,
like a nursing mother cherishes her own children.

# 1Thessalonians 02:08
Even so,
affectionately longing for you,
we were well pleased to impart to you not the Good News of God only,
but also our own souls,
because you had become very dear to us.

# 1Thessalonians 02:09
For you remember,
brothers,
our labor and travail;
for working night and day,
that we might not burden any of you,
we preached to you the Good News of God.

# 1Thessalonians 02:10
You are witnesses with God how holy,
righteously,
and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.

# 1Thessalonians 02:11
As you know,
we exhorted,
comforted,
and implored every one of you,
as a father does his own children,

# 1Thessalonians 02:12
to the end that you should walk worthily of God,
who calls you into his own Kingdom and glory.

# 1Thessalonians 02:13
For this cause we also thank God without ceasing that when you received from us the word of the message of God,
you accepted it not as the word of men,
but as it is in truth,
God's word,
which also works in you who believe.

# 1Thessalonians 02:14
For you,
brothers,
became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus;
for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen,
even as they did from the Jews

# 1Thessalonians 02:15
who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets,
and drove us out,
and don’t please God,
and are contrary to all men,

# 1Thessalonians 02:16
forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved,
to fill up their sins always.

But wrath has come on them to the uttermost.

# 1Thessalonians 02:17
But we,
brothers,
being bereaved of you for a short season in presence,
not in heart,
tried even harder to see your face with great desire,

# 1Thessalonians 02:18
because we wanted to come to you --- indeed,
I,
Paul,
once and again --- but Satan hindered us.

# 1Thessalonians 02:19
For what is our hope,
or joy,
or crown of rejoicing?

Isn’t it even you,
before our Lord Jesus at his coming?

# 1Thessalonians 02:20
For you are our glory and our joy.

# 1Thessalonians 02:21
1 Thessalonians.

# 1Thessalonians 03:01
Therefore when we couldn’t stand it any longer,
we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone,

# 1Thessalonians 03:02
and sent Timothy,
our brother and God's servant in the Good News of Christ,
to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith,

# 1Thessalonians 03:03
that no one would be moved by these afflictions.

For you know that we are appointed to this task.

# 1Thessalonians 03:04
For most certainly,
when we were with you,
we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction,
even as it happened,
and you know.

# 1Thessalonians 03:05
For this cause I also,
when I couldn’t stand it any longer,
sent that I might know your faith,
for fear that by any means the tempter had tempted you,
and our labor would have been in vain.

# 1Thessalonians 03:06
But Timothy has just now come to us from you,
and brought us glad news of your faith and love,
and that you have good memories of us always,
longing to see us,
even as we also long to see you.

# 1Thessalonians 03:07
For this cause,
brothers,
we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith.

# 1Thessalonians 03:08
For now we live,
if you stand fast in the Lord.

# 1Thessalonians 03:09
For what thanksgiving can we render again to God for you,
for all the joy with which we rejoice for your sakes before our God,

# 1Thessalonians 03:10
night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?

# 1Thessalonians 03:11
Now may our God and Father himself,
and our Lord Jesus Christ,
direct our way to you.

# 1Thessalonians 03:12
May the Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all men,
even as we also do toward you,

# 1Thessalonians 03:13
to the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

# 1Thessalonians 03:14
1 Thessalonians.

# 1Thessalonians 04:01
Finally then,
brothers,
we beg and exhort you in the Lord Jesus,
that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God,
that you abound more and more.

# 1Thessalonians 04:02
For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.

# 1Thessalonians 04:03
For this is the will of God:
your sanctification,
that you abstain from sexual immorality,

# 1Thessalonians 04:04
that each one of you know how to control his own body in sanctification and honor,

# 1Thessalonians 04:05
not in the passion of lust,
even as the Gentiles who don’t know God,

# 1Thessalonians 04:06
that no one should take advantage of and wrong a brother or sister in this matter;
because the Lord is an avenger in all these things,
as also we forewarned you and testified.

# 1Thessalonians 04:07
For God called us not for uncleanness,
but in sanctification.

# 1Thessalonians 04:08
Therefore he who rejects this doesn’t reject man,
but God,
who has also given his Holy Spirit to you.

# 1Thessalonians 04:09
But concerning brotherly love,
you have no need that one write to you.

For you yourselves are taught by God to love one another,

# 1Thessalonians 04:10
for indeed you do it toward all the brothers who are in all Macedonia.

But we exhort you,
brothers,
that you abound more and more;

# 1Thessalonians 04:11
and that you make it your ambition to lead a quiet life,
and to do your own business,
and to work with your own hands,
even as we instructed you,

# 1Thessalonians 04:12
that you may walk properly toward those who are outside,
and may have need of nothing.

# 1Thessalonians 04:13
But we don’t want you to be ignorant,
brothers,
concerning those who have fallen asleep,
so that you don’t grieve like the rest,
who have no hope.

# 1Thessalonians 04:14
For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,
even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.

# 1Thessalonians 04:15
For this we tell you by the word of the Lord,
that we who are alive,
who are left until the coming of the Lord,
will in no way precede those who have fallen asleep.

# 1Thessalonians 04:16
For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel and with God's trumpet.

The dead in Christ will rise first,

# 1Thessalonians 04:17
then we who are alive,
who are left,
will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.

So we will be with the Lord forever.

# 1Thessalonians 04:18
Therefore comfort one another with these words.

# 1Thessalonians 04:19
1 Thessalonians.

# 1Thessalonians 05:01
But concerning the times and the seasons,
brothers,
you have no need that anything be written to you.

# 1Thessalonians 05:02
For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.

# 1Thessalonians 05:03
For when they are saying,
``Peace and safety,'' then sudden destruction will come on them,
like birth pains on a pregnant woman.

Then they will in no way escape.

# 1Thessalonians 05:04
But you,
brothers,
aren’t in darkness,
that the day should overtake you like a thief.

# 1Thessalonians 05:05
You are all children of light and children of the day.

We don’t belong to the night,
nor to darkness,

# 1Thessalonians 05:06
so then let's not sleep,
as the rest do,
but let's watch and be sober.

# 1Thessalonians 05:07
For those who sleep,
sleep in the night;
and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.

# 1Thessalonians 05:08
But since we belong to the day,
let's be sober,
putting on the breastplate of faith and love,
and for a helmet,
the hope of salvation.

# 1Thessalonians 05:09
For God didn’t appoint us to wrath,
but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,

# 1Thessalonians 05:10
who died for us,
that,
whether we wake or sleep,
we should live together with him.

# 1Thessalonians 05:11
Therefore exhort one another,
and build each other up,
even as you also do.

# 1Thessalonians 05:12
But we beg you,
brothers,
to know those who labor among you,
and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,

# 1Thessalonians 05:13
and to respect and honor them in love for their work's sake.

Be at peace among yourselves.

# 1Thessalonians 05:14
We exhort you,
brothers:
Admonish the disorderly;
encourage the faint-hearted;
support the weak;
be patient toward all.

# 1Thessalonians 05:15
See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone,
but always follow after that which is good for one another and for all.

# 1Thessalonians 05:16
Always rejoice.

# 1Thessalonians 05:17
Pray without ceasing.

# 1Thessalonians 05:18
In everything give thanks,
for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.

# 1Thessalonians 05:19
Don’t quench the Spirit.

# 1Thessalonians 05:20
Don’t despise prophecies.

# 1Thessalonians 05:21
Test all things,
and hold firmly that which is good.

# 1Thessalonians 05:22
Abstain from every form of evil.

# 1Thessalonians 05:23
May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely.

May your whole spirit,
soul,
and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

# 1Thessalonians 05:24
He who calls you is faithful,
who will also do it.

# 1Thessalonians 05:25
Brothers,
pray for us.

# 1Thessalonians 05:26
Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.

# 1Thessalonians 05:27
I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.

# 1Thessalonians 05:28
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

Amen.
