# Book: Gospel of John

# Section: In the beginning
# John 01:01
In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.

# John 01:02
The same was in the beginning with God.

# John 01:03
All things were made through him.

Without him,
nothing was made that has been made.

# John 01:04
In him was life,
and the life was the light of men.

# John 01:05
The light shines in the darkness,
and the darkness hasn't overcome it.

# Section: There came a man sent from God
# John 01:06
There came a man sent from God
whose name was John.

# John 01:07
The same came as a witness,
that he might testify about the light,
that all might believe through him.

# John 01:08
He was not the light,
but was sent that he might testify about the light.

# Section: The true light
# John 01:09
STARTHERE

The true light that enlightens everyone
was coming into the world.

# John 01:10
He was in the world,
and the world was made through him,
and the world didn't recognize him.

# John 01:11
He came to his own,
and those who were his own didn't receive him.

# John 01:12
But as many as received him,
to them he gave the right to become God's children,
to those who believe in his name:
# John 01:13
who were born,
  not of blood,
  nor of the will of the flesh,
  nor of the will of man,
  but of God.

# Section: The Word became flesh
# John 01:14
The Word became flesh and lived among us.

We saw his glory,
such glory as of the only born Son of the Father,
full of grace and truth.

# Section: John testified
# John 01:15
John testified about him.

He cried out,
saying,
{
  This was he of whom I said,
  {
    He who comes after me has surpassed me,
    for he was before me.
  }
}

# Section: From his fullness
# John 01:16
From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.

# John 01:17
For the law was given through Moses.

Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.

# John 01:18
No one has seen God at any time.

The only born Son,
who is in the bosom of the Father,
has declared him.

# Section: This is John's testimony
# John 01:19
This is John's testimony,
when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him,
{
  Who are you?
}

# John 01:20
He declared,
and didn't deny,
but he declared,
{
  I am not the Christ.
}

# John 01:21
They asked him,
{
  What then?

  Are you Elijah?
}

He said,
{
  I am not.
}

{
  Are you the prophet?
}

He answered,
{
  No.
}

# John 01:22
They said therefore to him,
{
  Who are you?

  Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us.

  What do you say about yourself?
}

# John 01:23
He said,
{
  I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,
  {
    Make straight the way of the Lord,
  }

  as Isaiah the prophet said.
}

# Section: The ones who had been sent
# John 01:24
The ones who had been sent were from the Pharisees.

# John 01:25
They asked him,
{
  Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ,
  nor Elijah,
  nor the prophet?
}

# John 01:26
John answered them,
{
  I baptize in water,
  but among you stands one whom you don't know.

  # John 01:27
  He is the one who comes after me,
  who is preferred before me,
  whose sandal strap I'm not worthy to loosen.
}

# John 01:28
These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan,
where John was baptizing.

# Section: The next day
# John 01:29
The next day,
he saw Jesus coming to him,
and said,
{
  Behold!
  The Lamb of God,
  who takes away the sin of the world!

  # John 01:30
  This is he of whom I said,
  {
    After me comes a man who is preferred before me,
    for he was before me.
  }

  # John 01:31
  I didn't know him,
  but for this reason I came baptizing in water,
  that he would be revealed to Israel.
}

# Section: John testified
# John 01:32
John testified, saying,
{
  I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove out of heaven,
  and it remained on him.

  # John 01:33
  I didn't recognize him,
  but he who sent me to baptize in water said to me,
  {
    On whomever you will see the Spirit descending and remaining on him
    is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.
  }

  # John 01:34
  I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.
}

# Section: Again, the next day
# John 01:35
Again,
the next day,
John was standing with two of his disciples,
# John 01:36
and he looked at Jesus as he walked,
and said,
{
  Behold!
  The Lamb of God!
}

# John 01:37
The two disciples heard him speak,
and they followed Jesus.

# John 01:38
Jesus turned and saw them following,
and said to them,
{
  What are you looking for?
}

They said to him,
{
  Rabbi
}

(which is to say,
being interpreted,
Teacher),
{
  where are you staying?
}

# John 01:39
He said to them,
{
  Come and see.
}

They came and saw where he was staying,
and they stayed with him that day.

It was about the tenth hour.

# Section: One of the two who heard John
# John 01:40
One of the two who heard John and followed him was Andrew,
Simon Peter's brother.

# John 01:41
He first found his own brother, Simon,
and said to him,
{
  We have found the Messiah!
}

(which is, being interpreted, Christ).

# John 01:42
He brought him to Jesus.

Jesus looked at him and said,
{
  You are Simon the son of Jonah.

  You shall be called Cephas
}

(which is by interpretation, Peter).

# Section: On the next day
# John 01:43
On the next day,
he was determined to go out into Galilee,
and he found Philip.

Jesus said to him,
{
  Follow me.
}

# Section: Now Philip was from Bethsaida
# John 01:44
Now Philip was from Bethsaida,
the city of Andrew and Peter.

# John 01:45
Philip found Nathanael,
and said to him,
{
  We have found him
  of whom Moses in the law
  and also the prophets,
  wrote:
  {
    Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
}
}

# John 01:46
Nathanael said to him,
{
  Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?
}

Philip said to him,
{
  Come and see.
}

# Section: Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him
# John 01:47
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him,
and said about him,
{
  Behold!
  An Israelite indeed,
  in whom is no deceit!
}

# John 01:48
Nathanael said to him,
{
  How do you know me?
}

Jesus answered him,
{
  Before Philip called you,
  when you were under the fig tree,
  I saw you.
}

# John 01:49
Nathanael answered him,
{
  Rabbi,
  you are the Son of God!

  You are King of Israel!
}

# John 01:50
Jesus answered him,
{
  Because I told you,
  {
    I saw you underneath the fig tree,
  }

  do you believe?

  You will see greater things than these!
}

# John 01:51
He said to him,
{
  Most certainly,
  I tell you all,
  hereafter you will see heaven opened,
  and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.
}

# Section: The third day
# John 02:01
The third day,
there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee.

Jesus' mother was there.

# John 02:02
Jesus also was invited,
  with his disciples,
to the wedding.

# John 02:03
When the wine ran out,
Jesus' mother said to him,
{
  They have no wine.
}

# John 02:04
Jesus said to her,
{
  Woman,
  what does that have to do with you and me?

  My hour has not yet come.
}

# John 02:05
His mother said to the servants,
{
  Whatever he says to you,
  do it.
}

# Section: Now there were six water pots of stone
# John 02:06
Now there were six water pots of stone
set there after the Jews' way of purifying,
containing two or three metretes apiece.

# John 02:07
Jesus said to them,
{
  Fill the water pots with water.
}

So they filled them up to the brim.

# John 02:08
He said to them,
{
  Now draw some out,
  and take it to the ruler of the feast.
}

So they took it.

# John 02:09
When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine,
and didn't know where it came from
(but the servants who had drawn the water knew),
the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom
# John 02:10
and said to him,
{
  Everyone serves the good wine first,
  and when the guests have drunk freely,
  then that which is worse.

  You have kept the good wine until now!
}

# John 02:11
This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee,
and revealed his glory;
and his disciples believed in him.

# Section: After this, he went down to Capernaum
# John 02:12
After this,
he went down to Capernaum,
  he,
  and his mother,
  his brothers,
  and his disciples;
and they stayed there a few days.

# Section: The Passover of the Jews was at hand
# John 02:13
The Passover of the Jews was at hand,
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

# John 02:14
He found in the temple those who sold
  oxen,
  sheep,
  and doves,
and the changers of money sitting.

# John 02:15
He made a whip of cords
and drove all out of the temple,
both the sheep and the oxen;
and he poured out the changers' money
and overthrew their tables.

# John 02:16
To those who sold the doves,
he said,
{
  Take these things out of here!

  Don't make my Father's house a marketplace!
}

# John 02:17
His disciples remembered that it was written,
{
  Zeal for your house will eat me up.
}

# Section: The Jews therefore answered him
# John 02:18
The Jews therefore answered him,
{
  What sign do you show us,
  seeing that you do these things?
}

# John 02:19
Jesus answered them,
{
  Destroy this temple,
  and in three days I will raise it up.
}

# John 02:20
The Jews therefore said,
{
  It took forty-six years to build this temple!

  Will you raise it up in three days?
}

# John 02:21
But he spoke of the temple of his body.

# John 02:22
When therefore he was raised from the dead,
his disciples remembered that he said this,
and they believed the Scripture
and the word which Jesus had said.

# Section: Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover
# John 02:23
Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover,
during the feast,
many believed in his name,
observing his signs which he did.

# John 02:24
But Jesus didn't entrust himself to them,
because he knew everyone,
# John 02:25
and because he didn't need for anyone to testify concerning man;
for he himself knew what was in man.

# Section: Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus
# John 03:01
Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus,
a ruler of the Jews.

# John 03:02
He came to Jesus by night and said to him,
{
  Rabbi,
  we know that you are a teacher come from God,
  for no one can do these signs that you do,
  unless God is with him.
}

# John 03:03
Jesus answered him,
{
  Most certainly I tell you,
  unless one is born anew,
  he can't see God's Kingdom.
}

# Section: Nicodemus said to him
# John 03:04
Nicodemus said to him,
{
  How can a man be born when he is old?

  Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?
}

# John 03:05
Jesus answered,
{
  Most certainly I tell you,
  unless one is born of water and Spirit,
  he can't enter into God's Kingdom.

  # John 03:06
  That which is born of the flesh is flesh.

  That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.

  # John 03:07
  Don't marvel that I said to you,
  {
    You must be born anew.
  }

  # John 03:08
  The wind blows where it wants to,
  and you hear its sound,
  but don't know where it comes from and where it is going.

  So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.
}

# Section: Nicodemus answered him
# John 03:09
Nicodemus answered him,
{
  How can these things be?
}

# John 03:10
Jesus answered him,
{
  Are you the teacher of Israel,
  and don't understand these things?

  # John 03:11
  Most certainly I tell you,
  we speak that which we know
  and testify of that which we have seen,
  and you don't receive our witness.

  # John 03:12
  If I told you earthly things and you don't believe,
  how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?

  # John 03:13
  No one has ascended into heaven
  but he who descended out of heaven,
  the Son of Man, who is in heaven.

  # John 03:14
  As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
  even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
  # John 03:15
  that whoever believes in him should not perish,
  but have eternal life.

  # John 03:16
  For God so loved the world,
  that he gave his only born Son,
  that whoever believes in him should not perish,
  but have eternal life.

  # John 03:17
  For God didn't send his Son into the world to judge the world,
  but that the world should be saved through him.

  # John 03:18
  He who believes in him is not judged.

  He who doesn't believe has been judged already,
  because he has not believed
  in the name of the only born Son of God.
}

# Section: This is the judgment
{
  # John 03:19
  This is the judgment,
  that the light has come into the world,
  and men loved the darkness rather than the light,
  for their works were evil.

  # John 03:20
  For everyone who does evil hates the light
    and doesn't come to the light,
  lest his works would be exposed.

  # John 03:21
  But he who does the truth comes to the light,
  that his works may be revealed,
  that they have been done in God.
}

# Section: After these things
# John 03:22
After these things,
Jesus came with his disciples
into the land of Judea.

He stayed there with them and baptized.

# John 03:23
John also was baptizing in Enon near Salim,
because there was much water there.

They came and were baptized;
# John 03:24
for John was not yet thrown into prison.

# Section: Therefore a dispute arose
# John 03:25
Therefore a dispute arose on the part of John's disciples
with some Jews about purification.

# John 03:26
They came to John and said to him,
{
  Rabbi,
  he who was with you beyond the Jordan,
  to whom you have testified,
  behold,
  he baptizes,
  and everyone is coming to him.
}

# John 03:27
John answered,
{
  A man can receive nothing
  unless it has been given him from heaven.

  # John 03:28
  You yourselves testify that I said,
  {
    I am not the Christ,
  }

  but,
  {
    I have been sent before him.
  }

  # John 03:29
  He who has the bride is the bridegroom;
  but the friend of the bridegroom,
  who stands and hears him,
  rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice.

  Therefore my joy is made full.

  # John 03:30
  He must increase,
  but I must decrease.
}

# Section: He who comes from above
{
  # John 03:31
  He who comes from above is above all.

  He who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks of the earth.

  He who comes from heaven is above all.

  # John 03:32
  What he has seen and heard,
  of that he testifies;
  and no one receives his witness.

  # John 03:33
  He who has received his witness has set his seal to this,
  that God is true.

  # John 03:34
  For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God;
  for God gives the Spirit without measure.

  # John 03:35
  The Father loves the Son,
  and has given all things into his hand.

  # John 03:36
  One who believes in the Son has eternal life,
  but one who disobeys the Son won't see life,
  but the wrath of God remains on him.
}

# Section: Therefore when the Lord knew
# John 04:01
Therefore when the Lord knew
that the Pharisees had heard
that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John
# John 04:02
(although Jesus himself didn't baptize, but his disciples),
# John 04:03
he left Judea and departed into Galilee.

# Section: He needed to pass through Samaria
# John 04:04
He needed to pass through Samaria.

# John 04:05
So he came to a city of Samaria called Sychar,
near the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.

# John 04:06
Jacob's well was there.

Jesus therefore,
being tired from his journey,
sat down by the well.

It was about the sixth hour.

# Section: A woman of Samaria came to draw water.
# John 04:07
A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

Jesus said to her,
{
  Give me a drink.
}

# John 04:08
For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.

# Section: The Samaritan woman therefore said to him
# John 04:09
The Samaritan woman therefore said to him,
{
  How is it that you,
  being a Jew,
  ask for a drink from me,
  a Samaritan woman?
}

(For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)

# John 04:10
Jesus answered her,
{
  If you knew the gift of God,
  and who it is who says to you,
  {
    Give me a drink,
  }

  you would have asked him,
  and he would have given you living water.
}

# Section: The woman said to him
# John 04:11
The woman said to him,
{
  Sir,
  you have nothing to draw with,
  and the well is deep.

  So where do you get that living water?

  # John 04:12
  Are you greater than our father Jacob,
  who gave us the well and drank from it himself,
  as did his children and his livestock?
}

# John 04:13
Jesus answered her,
{
  Everyone who drinks of this water
    will thirst again,
  # John 04:14
  but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him
    will never thirst again;
  but the water that I will give him
    will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.
}

# Section: The woman said to him
# John 04:15
The woman said to him,
{
  Sir,
  give me this water,
  so that I don't get thirsty,
  neither come all the way here to draw.
}

# John 04:16
Jesus said to her,
{
  Go,
  call your husband,
  and come here.
}

# John 04:17
The woman answered,
{
  I have no husband.
}

Jesus said to her,
{
  You said well,
  {
    I have no husband,
  }

  # John 04:18
  for you have had five husbands;
  and he whom you now have is not your husband.

  This you have said truly.
}

# Section: The woman said to him
# John 04:19
The woman said to him,
{
  Sir,
  I perceive that you are a prophet.

  # John 04:20
  Our fathers worshiped in this mountain,
  and you Jews say that in Jerusalem
  is the place where people ought to worship.
}

# John 04:21
Jesus said to her,
{
  Woman, believe me,
  the hour is coming
  when neither in this mountain
  nor in Jerusalem
  will you worship the Father.

  # John 04:22
  You worship that which you don't know.

  We worship that which we know;
  for salvation is from the Jews.

  # John 04:23
  But the hour comes,
  and now is,
  when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth,
  for the Father seeks such to be his worshipers.

  # John 04:24
  God is spirit,
  and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
}

# Section: The woman said to him
# John 04:25
The woman said to him,
{
  I know that Messiah is coming,
  he who is called Christ.

  When he has come,
  he will declare to us all things.
}

# John 04:26
Jesus said to her,
{
  I am he,
  the one who speaks to you.
}

# Section: Just then, his disciples came.
# John 04:27
Just then, his disciples came.

They marveled that he was speaking with a woman;
yet no one said,
{
  What are you looking for?
}

or,
{
  Why do you speak with her?
}

# Section: So the woman left her water pot
# John 04:28
So the woman left her water pot,
went away into the city,
and said to the people,
# John 04:29
{
  Come,
  see a man
  who told me everything that I have done.

  Can this be the Christ?
}

# John 04:30
They went out of the city,
and were coming to him.

# Section: In the meanwhile
# John 04:31
In the meanwhile,
the disciples urged him,
saying,
{
  Rabbi, eat.
}

# John 04:32
But he said to them,
{
  I have food to eat that you don't know about.
}

# John 04:33
The disciples therefore said to one another,
{
  Has anyone brought him something to eat?
}

# John 04:34
Jesus said to them,
{
  My food is to do the will of him who sent me
  and to accomplish his work.

  # John 04:35
  Don't you say,
  {
    There are yet four months until the harvest?
  }

  Behold!
  I tell you,
  lift up your eyes and look at the fields,
  that they are white for harvest already.

  # John 04:36
  He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit to eternal life,
  that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.

  # John 04:37
  For in this the saying is true,
  {
    One sows and another reaps.
  }

  # John 04:38
  I sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored.

  Others have labored,
  and you have entered into their labor.
}

# Section: From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him
# John 04:39
From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him
because of the word of the woman,
who testified,
{
  He told me everything that I have done.
}

# John 04:40
So when the Samaritans came to him,
they begged him to stay with them.

He stayed there two days.

# John 04:41
Many more believed because of his word.

# John 04:42
They said to the woman,
{
  Now we believe,
  not because of your speaking;
  for we have heard for ourselves,
  and know that this is indeed the Christ,
  the Savior of the world.
}

# Section: After the two days
# John 04:43
After the two days
he went out from there
and went into Galilee.

# John 04:44
For Jesus himself testified
that a prophet has no honor in his own country.

# John 04:45
So when he came into Galilee,
the Galileans received him,
having seen all the things
  that he did in Jerusalem
  at the feast,
for they also went to the feast.

# Section: Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee
# John 04:46
Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee,
where he made the water into wine.

There was a certain nobleman
whose son was sick at Capernaum.

# John 04:47
When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee,
he went to him
and begged him
that he would come down and heal his son,
for he was at the point of death.

# John 04:48
Jesus therefore said to him,
{
  Unless you see signs and wonders,
  you will in no way believe.
}

# John 04:49
The nobleman said to him,
{
  Sir, come down before my child dies.
}

# John 04:50
Jesus said to him,
{
  Go your way.

  Your son lives.
}

The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him,
and he went his way.

# Section: As he was going down
# John 04:51
As he was going down,
his servants met him and reported,
saying
{
  Your child lives!
}

# John 04:52
So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better.

They said therefore to him,
{
  Yesterday at the seventh hour,
  the fever left him.
}

# John 04:53
So the father knew that it was at that hour
in which Jesus said to him,
{
  Your son lives.

  He believed,
  as did his whole house.
}

# John 04:54
This is again the second sign that Jesus did,
having come out of Judea into Galilee.

# Section: After these things
# John 05:01
After these things,
there was a feast of the Jews,
and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.

# John 05:02
Now in Jerusalem by the sheep gate,
there is a pool,
which is called in Hebrew, 
{
  Bethesda
}

,
having five porches.

# John 05:03
In these lay a great multitude of those who were
  sick,
  blind,
  lame,
  or paralyzed,
waiting for the moving of the water;
# John 05:04
for an angel went down at certain times
into the pool
and stirred up the water.

Whoever stepped in first
after the stirring of the water
was healed of whatever disease he had.

# Section: A certain man was there
# John 05:05
A certain man was there
who had been sick for thirty-eight years.

# John 05:06
When Jesus saw him lying there,
and knew that he had been sick for a long time,
he asked him,
{
  Do you want to be made well?
}

# John 05:07
The sick man answered him,
{
  Sir,
  I have no one to put me into the pool
  when the water is stirred up,
  but while I'm coming,
  another steps down before me.
}

# John 05:08
Jesus said to him,
{
  Arise,
  take up your mat,
  and walk.
}

# John 05:09
Immediately,
the man was made well,
and took up his mat and walked.

# Section: Now that day was a Sabbath.
Now that day was a Sabbath.

# John 05:10
So the Jews said to him who was cured,
{
  It is the Sabbath.

  It is not lawful for you to carry the mat.
}

# John 05:11
He answered them,
{
  He who made me well said to me,
  {
    Take up your mat and walk.
  }
}

# John 05:12
Then they asked him,
{
  Who is the man who said to you,
  {
    Take up your mat and walk
  }

  ?
}

# John 05:13
But he who was healed didn't know who it was,
for Jesus had withdrawn,
a crowd being in the place.

# Section: Afterward Jesus found him in the temple
# John 05:14
Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him,
{
  Behold!
  You are made well.

  Sin no more,
  so that nothing worse happens to you.
}

# John 05:15
The man went away,
and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.

# John 05:16
For this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill him,
because he did these things on the Sabbath.

# John 05:17
But Jesus answered them,
{
  My Father is still working,
  so I am working, too.
}

# John 05:18
For this cause therefore
the Jews sought all the more to kill him,
because he not only broke the Sabbath,
but also called God his own Father,
making himself equal with God.

# Section: Jesus therefore answered them
# John 05:19
Jesus therefore answered them,
{
  Most certainly, I tell you,
  the Son can do nothing of himself,
  but what he sees the Father doing.

  For whatever things he does,
  these the Son also does likewise.

  # John 05:20
  For the Father has affection for the Son,
  and shows him all things that he himself does.

  He will show him greater works than these,
  that you may marvel.

  # John 05:21
  For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life,
  even so the Son also gives life to whom he desires.

  # John 05:22
  For the Father judges no one,
  but he has given all judgment to the Son,
  # John 05:23
  that all may honor the Son,
  even as they honor the Father.

  He who doesn't honor the Son
  doesn't honor the Father who sent him.
}

# Section:   Most certainly I tell you
{
  # John 05:24
  Most certainly I tell you,
  he who hears my word
  and believes him who sent me has eternal life,
  and doesn't come into judgment,
  but has passed out of death into life.
}

# Section:   Most certainly I tell you
{
  # John 05:25
  Most certainly I tell you,
  the hour comes,
  and now is,
  when the dead will hear the Son of God's voice;
  and those who hear will live.

  # John 05:26
  For as the Father has life in himself,
  even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself.

  # John 05:27
  He also gave him authority to execute judgment,
  because he is a son of man.
}

# Section:   Don't marvel at this
{
  # John 05:28
  Don't marvel at this,
  for the hour comes
  in which all who are in the tombs
  will hear his voice
  # John 05:29
  and will come out;
  those who have done good,
    to the resurrection of life;
  and those who have done evil,
    to the resurrection of judgment.
}

# Section:   I can of myself do nothing
{
  # John 05:30
  I can of myself do nothing.

  As I hear, I judge;
  and my judgment is righteous,
  because I don't seek my own will,
  but the will of my Father who sent me.

  # John 05:31
  If I testify about myself,
  my witness is not valid.

  # John 05:32
  It is another who testifies about me.

  I know that the testimony
  which he testifies about me
  is true.
}

# Section:   You have sent to John,
{
  # John 05:33
  You have sent to John,
  and he has testified to the truth.

  # John 05:34
  But the testimony which I receive is not from man.

  However,
  I say these things that you may be saved.

  # John 05:35
  He was the burning and shining lamp,
  and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.

  # John 05:36
  But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John;
  for the works which the Father gave me to accomplish,
  the very works that I do,
  testify about me,
  that the Father has sent me.
}

# Section:   The Father himself
{
  # John 05:37
  The Father himself,
  who sent me,
  has testified about me.

  You have neither heard his voice at any time,
  nor seen his form.

  # John 05:38
  You don't have his word living in you,
  because you don't believe him whom he sent.
}

# Section:   You search the Scriptures
{
  # John 05:39
  You search the Scriptures,
  because you think that in them you have eternal life;
  and these are they which testify about me.

  # John 05:40
  Yet you will not come to me,
  that you may have life.
}

# Section:   I don't receive glory from men.
{
  # John 05:41
  I don't receive glory from men.

  # John 05:42
  But I know you,
  that you don't have God's love in yourselves.

  # John 05:43
  I have come in my Father's name,
  and you don't receive me.

  If another comes in his own name,
  you will receive him.

  # John 05:44
  How can you believe,
  who receive glory from one another,
  and you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God?
}

# Section:   Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father
{
  # John 05:45
  Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father.

  There is one who accuses you,
  even Moses,
  on whom you have set your hope.

  # John 05:46
  For if you believed Moses,
  you would believe me;
  for he wrote about me.

  # John 05:47
  But if you don't believe his writings,
  how will you believe my words?
}

# Section: After these things
# John 06:01
After these things,
Jesus went away to the other side of the sea of Galilee,
which is also called the Sea of Tiberias.

# John 06:02
A great multitude followed him,
because they saw his signs
which he did on those who were sick.

# John 06:03
Jesus went up into the mountain,
and he sat there with his disciples.

# John 06:04
Now the Passover,
the feast of the Jews,
was at hand.

# Section: Jesus therefore
# John 06:05
Jesus therefore,
lifting up his eyes
and seeing that a great multitude was coming to him,
said to Philip,
{
  Where are we to buy bread,
  that these may eat?
}

# John 06:06
He said this to test him,
for he himself knew what he would do.

# John 06:07
Philip answered him,
{
  Two hundred denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them,
  that every one of them may receive a little.
}

# John 06:08
One of his disciples, Andrew,
  Simon Peter's brother,
said to him,
# John 06:09
{
  There is a boy here
  who has five barley loaves and two fish,
  but what are these among so many?
}

# Section: Jesus said
# John 06:10
Jesus said,
{
  Have the people sit down.
}

Now there was much grass in that place.

So the men sat down,
in number about five thousand.

# John 06:11
Jesus took the loaves,
and having given thanks,
he distributed to the disciples,
and the disciples to those who were sitting down,
likewise also of the fish as much as they desired.

# John 06:12
When they were filled,
he said to his disciples,
{
  Gather up the broken pieces which are left over,
  that nothing be lost.
}

# John 06:13
So they gathered them up,
and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves,
which were left over by those who had eaten.

# Section: When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did
# John 06:14
When therefore the people saw the sign which Jesus did,
they said,
{
  This is truly the prophet who comes into the world.
}

# John 06:15
Jesus therefore,
perceiving that they were about to come
and take him by force
to make him king,
withdrew again to the mountain by himself.

# Section: When evening came
# John 06:16
When evening came,
his disciples went down to the sea.

# John 06:17
They entered into the boat,
and were going over the sea to Capernaum.

It was now dark,
and Jesus had not come to them.

# John 06:18
The sea was tossed by a great wind blowing.

# John 06:19
When therefore they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia,
they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat;
and they were afraid.

# John 06:20
But he said to them,
{
  It is I.

  Don't be afraid.
}

# John 06:21
They were willing therefore to receive him into the boat.

Immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.

# Section: On the next day
# John 06:22
On the next day,
the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea
saw that there was no other boat there,
except the one in which his disciples had embarked,
and that Jesus hadn't entered with his disciples into the boat,
but his disciples had gone away alone.

# John 06:23
However,
boats from Tiberias came near to the place
where they ate the bread
after the Lord had given thanks.

# John 06:24
When the multitude therefore saw that Jesus wasn't there,
nor his disciples,
they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum,
seeking Jesus.

# Section: When they found him on the other side of the sea
# John 06:25
When they found him on the other side of the sea,
they asked him,
{
  Rabbi,
  when did you come here?
}

# John 06:26
Jesus answered them,
{
  Most certainly I tell you,
  you seek me,
  not because you saw signs,
  but because you ate of the loaves and were filled.

  # John 06:27
  Don't work for the food which perishes,
  but for the food which remains to eternal life,
  which the Son of Man will give to you.

  For God the Father has sealed him.
}

# John 06:28
They said therefore to him,
{
  What must we do,
  that we may work the works of God?
}

# John 06:29
Jesus answered them,
{
  This is the work of God,
  that you believe in him whom he has sent.
}

# John 06:30
They said therefore to him,
{
  What then do you do for a sign,
  that we may see and believe you?

  What work do you do?

  # John 06:31
  Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness.

  As it is written,
  {
    He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.
  }
}

# John 06:32
Jesus therefore said to them,
{
  Most certainly, I tell you,
  it wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven,
  but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.

  # John 06:33
  For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven
  and gives life to the world.
}

# John 06:34
They said therefore to him,
{
  Lord,
  always give us this bread.
}

# John 06:35
Jesus said to them,
{
  I am the bread of life.

  Whoever comes to me will not be hungry,
  and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.

  # John 06:36
  But I told you that you have seen me,
  and yet you don't believe.

  # John 06:37
  All those whom the Father gives me will come to me.

  He who comes to me I will in no way throw out.

  # John 06:38
  For I have come down from heaven,
  not to do my own will,
  but the will of him who sent me.

  # John 06:39
  This is the will of my Father who sent me,
  that of all he has given to me I should lose nothing,
  but should raise him up at the last day.

  # John 06:40
  This is the will of the one who sent me,
  that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life;
  and I will raise him up at the last day.
}

# John 06:41
The Jews therefore murmured concerning him,
because he said,
{
  I am the bread which came down out of heaven.
}

# John 06:42
They said,
{
  Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph,
  whose father and mother we know?

  How then does he say,
  {
    I have come down out of heaven?
  }
}

# John 06:43
Therefore Jesus answered them,
{
  Don't murmur among yourselves.

  # John 06:44
  No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him;
  and I will raise him up in the last day.

  # John 06:45
  It is written in the prophets,
  {
    They will all be taught by God.
  }

  Therefore everyone who hears from the Father and has learned,
  comes to me.

  # John 06:46
  Not that anyone has seen the Father,
  except he who is from God.

  He has seen the Father.

  # John 06:47
  Most certainly, I tell you,
  he who believes in me has eternal life.

  # John 06:48
  I am the bread of life.

  # John 06:49
  Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.

  # John 06:50
  This is the bread which comes down out of heaven,
  that anyone may eat of it and not die.

  # John 06:51
  I am the living bread which came down out of heaven.

  If anyone eats of this bread,
  he will live forever.

  Yes,
  the bread which I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.
}

# John 06:52
The Jews therefore contended with one another,
saying,
{
  How can this man give us his flesh to eat?
}

# John 06:53
Jesus therefore said to them,
{
  Most certainly I tell you,
  unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood,
  you don't have life in yourselves.

  # John 06:54
  He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life,
  and I will raise him up at the last day.

  # John 06:55
  For my flesh is food indeed,
  and my blood is drink indeed.

  # John 06:56
  He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me,
  and I in him.

  # John 06:57
  As the living Father sent me,
  and I live because of the Father,
  so he who feeds on me will also live because of me.

  # John 06:58
  This is the bread which came down out of heaven ---
  not as our fathers ate the manna and died.

  He who eats this bread will live forever.
}

# John 06:59
He said these things in the synagogue,
as he taught in Capernaum.

# John 06:60
Therefore many of his disciples,
when they heard this,
said,
{
  This is a hard saying!

  Who can listen to it?
}

# John 06:61
But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this,
said to them,
{
  Does this cause you to stumble?

  # John 06:62
  Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending
  to where he was before?

  # John 06:63
  It is the spirit who gives life.

  The flesh profits nothing.

  The words that I speak to you are spirit,
  and are life.
}

# John 06:64
But there are some of you who don't believe.

For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe,
and who it was who would betray him.

# John 06:65
He said,
{
  For this cause I have said to you that no one can come to me,
  unless it is given to him by my Father.
}

# John 06:66
At this,
many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.

# John 06:67
Jesus said therefore to the twelve,
{
  You don't also want to go away,
  do you?
}

# John 06:68
Simon Peter answered him,
{
  Lord, to whom would we go?

  You have the words of eternal life.

  # John 06:69
  We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ,
  the Son of the living God.
}

# John 06:70
Jesus answered them,
{
  Didn't I choose you, the twelve,
  and one of you is a devil?
}

# John 06:71
Now he spoke of Judas,
  the son of Simon Iscariot,
for it was he who would betray him,
being one of the twelve.

# Section: After these things
# John 07:01
After these things,
Jesus was walking in Galilee,
for he wouldn't walk in Judea,
because the Jews sought to kill him.

# John 07:02
Now the feast of the Jews,
  the Feast of Booths,
was at hand.

# John 07:03
His brothers therefore said to him,
{
  Depart from here and go into Judea,
  that your disciples also may see your works which you do.

  # John 07:04
  For no one does anything in secret while he seeks to be known openly.

  If you do these things,
  reveal yourself to the world.
}

# John 07:05
For even his brothers didn't believe in him.

# John 07:06
Jesus therefore said to them,
{
  My time has not yet come,
  but your time is always ready.

  # John 07:07
  The world can't hate you,
  but it hates me,
  because I testify about it,
  that its works are evil.

  # John 07:08
  You go up to the feast.

  I am not yet going up to this feast,
  because my time is not yet fulfilled.
}

# John 07:09
Having said these things to them,
he stayed in Galilee.

# John 07:10
But when his brothers had gone up to the feast,
then he also went up,
not publicly,
but as it were in secret.

# John 07:11
The Jews therefore sought him at the feast,
and said,
{
  Where is he?
}

# John 07:12
There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him.

Some said,
{
  He is a good man.
}

Others said,
{
  Not so,
  but he leads the multitude astray.
}

# John 07:13
Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.

# John 07:14
But when it was now the middle of the feast,
Jesus went up into the temple and taught.

# John 07:15
The Jews therefore marveled,
saying,
{
  How does this man know letters,
  having never been educated?
}

# John 07:16
Jesus therefore answered them,
{
  My teaching is not mine,
  but his who sent me.

  # John 07:17
  If anyone desires to do his will,
  he will know about the teaching,
  whether it is from God or if I am speaking from myself.

  # John 07:18
  He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory,
  but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true,
  and no unrighteousness is in him.

  # John 07:19
  Didn't Moses give you the law,
  and yet none of you keeps the law?

  Why do you seek to kill me?
}

# John 07:20
The multitude answered,
{
  You have a demon!

  Who seeks to kill you?
}

# John 07:21
Jesus answered them,
{
  I did one work and you all marvel because of it.

  # John 07:22
  Moses has given you circumcision
  (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers),
  and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.

  # John 07:23
  If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath,
  that the law of Moses may not be broken,
  are you angry with me
  because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?

  # John 07:24
  Don't judge according to appearance,
  but judge righteous judgment.
}

# John 07:25
Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said,
{
  Isn't this he whom they seek to kill?

  # John 07:26
  Behold,
  he speaks openly,
  and they say nothing to him.

  Can it be that the rulers indeed
  know that this is truly the Christ?

  # John 07:27
  However,
  we know where this man comes from,
  but when the Christ comes,
  no one will know where he comes from.
}

# John 07:28
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple,
teaching and saying,
{
  You both know me,
  and know where I am from.

  I have not come of myself,
  but he who sent me is true,
  whom you don't know.

  # John 07:29
  I know him,
  because I am from him,
  and he sent me.
}

# John 07:30
They sought therefore to take him;
but no one laid a hand on him,
because his hour had not yet come.

# John 07:31
But of the multitude,
many believed in him.

They said,
{
  When the Christ comes,
  he won't do more signs than those which this man has done,
  will he?
}

# John 07:32
The Pharisees heard the multitude
murmuring these things concerning him,
and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers
to arrest him.

# John 07:33
Then Jesus said,
{
  I will be with you a little while longer,
  then I go to him who sent me.

  # John 07:34
  You will seek me and won't find me.

  You can't come where I am.
}

# John 07:35
The Jews therefore said among themselves,
{
  Where will this man go that we won't find him?

  Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?

  # John 07:36
  What is this word that he said,
  {
    You will seek me,
  and won't find me;
  }

  and
  {
    Where I am, you can't come
  }
  ?
}

# John 07:37
Now on the last and greatest day of the feast,
Jesus stood and cried out,
{
  If anyone is thirsty,
  let him come to me and drink!

  # John 07:38
  He who believes in me,
  as the Scripture has said,
  from within him will flow rivers of living water.
}

# John 07:39
But he said this about the Spirit,
which those believing in him were to receive.

For the Holy Spirit was not yet given,
because Jesus wasn't yet glorified.

# John 07:40
Many of the multitude therefore,
when they heard these words,
said,
{
  This is truly the prophet.
}

# John 07:41
Others said,
{
  This is the Christ.
}

But some said,
{
  What?

  Does the Christ come out of Galilee?

  # John 07:42
  Hasn't the Scripture said
  that the Christ comes of the offspring of David,
  and from Bethlehem,
  the village where David was?
}

# John 07:43
So a division arose in the multitude because of him.

# John 07:44
Some of them would have arrested him,
but no one laid hands on him.

# John 07:45
The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees;
and they said to them,
{
  Why didn't you bring him?
}

# John 07:46
The officers answered,
{
  No man ever spoke like this man!
}

# John 07:47
The Pharisees therefore answered them,
{
  You aren't also led astray,
  are you?

  # John 07:48
  Have any of the rulers or any of the Pharisees believed in him?

  # John 07:49
  But this multitude that doesn't know the law is cursed.
}

# John 07:50
Nicodemus (he who came to him by night,
being one of them) said to them,

# John 07:51
{
  Does our law judge a man
  unless it first hears from him personally
  and knows what he does?
}

# John 07:52
They answered him,
{
  Are you also from Galilee?

  Search and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.
}

# John 07:53
Everyone went to his own house,
# John 08:01
but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.

# John 08:02
Now very early in the morning,
he came again into the temple,
and all the people came to him.

He sat down and taught them.

# John 08:03
The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery.

Having set her in the middle,
# John 08:04
they told him,
{
  Teacher,
  we found this woman in adultery,
  in the very act.

  # John 08:05
  Now in our law,
  Moses commanded us to stone such women.

  What then do you say about her?
}

# John 08:06
They said this testing him,
that they might have something to accuse him of.

But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with his finger.

# John 08:07
But when they continued asking him,
he looked up and said to them,
{
  He who is without sin among you,
  let him throw the first stone at her.
}

# John 08:08
Again he stooped down
and wrote on the ground with his finger.

# John 08:09
They,
when they heard it,
being convicted by their conscience,
went out one by one,
beginning from the oldest,
even to the last.

Jesus was left alone with the woman where she was,
in the middle.

# John 08:10
Jesus,
standing up,
saw her and said,
{
  Woman,
  where are your accusers?

  Did no one condemn you?
}

# John 08:11
She said,
{
  No one, Lord.
}

Jesus said,
{
  Neither do I condemn you.

  Go your way.

  From now on,
  sin no more.
}

# John 08:12
Again, therefore,
Jesus spoke to them,
saying,
{
  I am the light of the world.

  He who follows me will not walk in the darkness,
  but will have the light of life.
}

# John 08:13
The Pharisees therefore said to him,
{
  You testify about yourself.

  Your testimony is not valid.
}

# John 08:14
Jesus answered them,
{
  Even if I testify about myself,
  my testimony is true,
  for I know where I came from,
  and where I am going;
  but you don't know where I came from,
  or where I am going.

  # John 08:15
  You judge according to the flesh.

  I judge no one.

  # John 08:16
  Even if I do judge,
  my judgment is true,
  for I am not alone,
  but I am with the Father who sent me.

  # John 08:17
  It's also written in your law that the testimony of two people is valid.

  # John 08:18
  I am one who testifies about myself,
  and the Father who sent me testifies about me.
}

# John 08:19
They said therefore to him,
{
  Where is your Father?
}

Jesus answered,
{
  You know neither me nor my Father.

  If you knew me,
  you would know my Father also.
}

# John 08:20
Jesus spoke these words in the treasury,
as he taught in the temple.

Yet no one arrested him,
because his hour had not yet come.

# John 08:21
Jesus said therefore again to them,
{
  I am going away,
  and you will seek me,
  and you will die in your sins.

  Where I go,
  you can't come.
}

# John 08:22
The Jews therefore said,
{
  Will he kill himself,
  because he says,
  {
    Where I am going,
    you can't come
  }
  ?
}

# John 08:23
He said to them,
{
  You are from beneath.

  I am from above.

  You are of this world.

  I am not of this world.

  # John 08:24
  I said therefore to you that you will die in your sins;
  for unless you believe that I am he,
  you will die in your sins.
}

# John 08:25
They said therefore to him,
{
  Who are you?
}

Jesus said to them,
{
  Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.

  # John 08:26
  I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you.

  However,
  he who sent me is true;
  and the things which I heard from him,
  these I say to the world.
}

# John 08:27
They didn't understand
that he spoke to them about the Father.

# John 08:28
Jesus therefore said to them,
{
  When you have lifted up the Son of Man,
  then you will know that I am he,
  and I do nothing of myself,
  but as my Father taught me,
  I say these things.

  # John 08:29
  He who sent me is with me.

  The Father hasn't left me alone,
  for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.
}

# John 08:30
As he spoke these things,
many believed in him.

# John 08:31
Jesus therefore said to those Jews who had believed him,
{
  If you remain in my word,
  then you are truly my disciples.

  # John 08:32
  You will know the truth,
  and the truth will make you free.
}

# John 08:33
They answered him,
{
  We are Abraham's offspring,
  and have never been in bondage to anyone.

  How do you say,
  {
    You will be made free
  }
  ?
}

# John 08:34
Jesus answered them,
{
  Most certainly I tell you,
  everyone who commits sin is the bondservant of sin.

  # John 08:35
  A bondservant doesn't live in the house forever.

  A son remains forever.

  # John 08:36
  If therefore the Son makes you free,
  you will be free indeed.

  # John 08:37
  I know that you are Abraham's offspring,
  yet you seek to kill me,
  because my word finds no place in you.

  # John 08:38
  I say the things which I have seen with my Father;
  and you also do the things which you have seen with your father.
}

# John 08:39
They answered him,
{
  Our father is Abraham.
}

Jesus said to them,
{
  If you were Abraham's children,
  you would do the works of Abraham.

  # John 08:40
  But now you seek to kill me,
  a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God.

  Abraham didn't do this.

  # John 08:41
  You do the works of your father.
}

They said to him,
{
  We were not born of sexual immorality.

  We have one Father, God.
}

# John 08:42
Therefore Jesus said to them,
{
  If God were your father,
  you would love me,
  for I came out and have come from God.

  For I haven't come of myself,
  but he sent me.

  # John 08:43
  Why don't you understand my speech?

  Because you can't hear my word.

  # John 08:44
  You are of your father the devil,
  and you want to do the desires of your father.

  He was a murderer from the beginning,
  and doesn't stand in the truth,
  because there is no truth in him.

  When he speaks a lie,
  he speaks on his own;
  for he is a liar,
  and the father of lies.

  # John 08:45
  But because I tell the truth,
  you don't believe me.

  # John 08:46
  Which of you convicts me of sin?

  If I tell the truth,
  why do you not believe me?

  # John 08:47
  He who is of God hears the words of God.

  For this cause you don't hear,
  because you are not of God.
}

# John 08:48
Then the Jews answered him,
{
  Don't we say well that you are a Samaritan,
  and have a demon?
}

# John 08:49
Jesus answered,
{
  I don't have a demon,
  but I honor my Father and you dishonor me.

  # John 08:50
  But I don't seek my own glory.

  There is one who seeks and judges.

  # John 08:51
  Most certainly, I tell you,
  if a person keeps my word,
  he will never see death.
}

# John 08:52
Then the Jews said to him,
{
  Now we know that you have a demon.

  Abraham died,
  as did the prophets;
  and you say,
  {
    If a man keeps my word,
    he will never taste of death.
  }

  # John 08:53
  Are you greater than our father Abraham,
  who died?

  The prophets died.

  Who do you make yourself out to be?
}

# John 08:54
Jesus answered,
{
  If I glorify myself,
  my glory is nothing.

  It is my Father who glorifies me,
  of whom you say that he is our God.

  # John 08:55
  You have not known him,
  but I know him.

  If I said,
  {
    I don't know him,
  }

  I would be like you, a liar.

  But I know him and keep his word.

  # John 08:56
  Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day.

  He saw it and was glad.
}

# John 08:57
The Jews therefore said to him,
{
  You are not yet fifty years old!

  Have you seen Abraham?
}

# John 08:58
Jesus said to them,
{
  Most certainly, I tell you,
  before Abraham came into existence,
  I AM.
}

# John 08:59
Therefore they took up stones to throw at him,
but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple,
having gone through the middle of them,
and so passed by.

# John 09:01
As he passed by,
he saw a man blind from birth.

# John 09:02
His disciples asked him,
{
  Rabbi,
  who sinned,
  this man or his parents,
  that he was born blind?
}

# John 09:03
Jesus answered,
{
  This man didn't sin,
  nor did his parents,
  but that the works of God might be revealed in him.

  # John 09:04
  I must work the works of him who sent me while it is day.

  The night is coming,
  when no one can work.

  # John 09:05
  While I am in the world,
  I am the light of the world.
}

# John 09:06
When he had said this,
he spat on the ground,
made mud with the saliva,
anointed the blind man's eyes with the mud,

# John 09:07
and said to him,
{
  Go,
  wash in the pool of Siloam
}

(which means ``Sent'').

So he went away,
washed,
and came back seeing.

# John 09:08
Therefore the neighbors
and those who saw that he was blind before
said,
{
  Isn't this he who sat and begged?
}

# John 09:09
Others were saying,
{
  It is he.
}

Still others were saying,
{
  He looks like him.
}

He said,
{
  I am he.
}

# John 09:10
They therefore were asking him,
{
  How were your eyes opened?
}

# John 09:11
He answered,
{
  A man called Jesus made mud,
  anointed my eyes,
  and said to me,
  {
    Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.
  }

  So I went away and washed,
  and I received sight.
}

# John 09:12
Then they asked him,
{
  Where is he?
}

He said,
{
  I don't know.
}

# John 09:13
They brought him who had been blind to the Pharisees.

# John 09:14
It was a Sabbath
when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.

# John 09:15
Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him
how he received his sight.

He said to them,
{
  He put mud on my eyes,
  I washed,
  and I see.
}

# John 09:16
Some therefore of the Pharisees said,
{
  This man is not from God,
  because he doesn't keep the Sabbath.
}

Others said,
{
  How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?
}

So there was division among them.

# John 09:17
Therefore they asked the blind man again,
{
  What do you say about him,
  because he opened your eyes?
}

He said,
{
  He is a prophet.
}

# John 09:18
The Jews therefore didn't believe concerning him,
that he had been blind and had received his sight,
until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,
# John 09:19
and asked them,
{
  Is this your son,
  whom you say was born blind?

  How then does he now see?
}

# John 09:20
His parents answered them,
{
  We know that this is our son,
  and that he was born blind;
  # John 09:21
  but how he now sees,
  we don't know;
  or who opened his eyes,
  we don't know.

  He is of age.

  Ask him.

  He will speak for himself.
}

# John 09:22
His parents said these things because they feared the Jews;
for the Jews had already agreed
that if any man would confess him as Christ,
he would be put out of the synagogue.

# John 09:23
Therefore his parents said,
{
  He is of age.

  Ask him.
}

# John 09:24
So they called the man who was blind a second time,
and said to him,
{
  Give glory to God.

  We know that this man is a sinner.
}

# John 09:25
He therefore answered,
{
  I don't know if he is a sinner.

  One thing I do know:
  that though I was blind,
  now I see.
}

# John 09:26
They said to him again,
{
  What did he do to you?

  How did he open your eyes?
}

# John 09:27
He answered them,
{
  I told you already,
  and you didn't listen.

  Why do you want to hear it again?

  You don't also want to become his disciples,
  do you?
}

# John 09:28
They insulted him and said,
{
  You are his disciple,
  but we are disciples of Moses.

  # John 09:29
  We know that God has spoken to Moses.

  But as for this man,
  we don't know where he comes from.
}

# John 09:30
The man answered them,
{
  How amazing!

  You don't know where he comes from,
  yet he opened my eyes.

  # John 09:31
  We know that God doesn't listen to sinners,
  but if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will,
  he listens to him.

  # John 09:32
  Since the world began
  it has never been heard of
  that anyone opened the eyes of someone born blind.

  # John 09:33
  If this man were not from God,
  he could do nothing.
}

# John 09:34
They answered him,
{
  You were altogether born in sins,
  and do you teach us?
}

Then they threw him out.

# John 09:35
Jesus heard that they had thrown him out,
and finding him,
he said,
{
  Do you believe in the Son of God?
}

# John 09:36
He answered,
{
  Who is he, Lord,
  that I may believe in him?
}

# John 09:37
Jesus said to him,
{
  You have both seen him,
  and it is he who speaks with you.
}

# John 09:38
He said,
{
  Lord, I believe!
}

and he worshiped him.

# John 09:39
Jesus said,
{
  I came into this world for judgment,
  that those who don't see may see;
and that those who see may become blind.
}

# John 09:40
Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things,
and said to him,
{
  Are we also blind?
}

# John 09:41
Jesus said to them,
{
  If you were blind,
  you would have no sin;
  but now you say,
  {
    We see.
  }

  Therefore your sin remains.

  # John 10:01
  Most certainly,
  I tell you,
  one who doesn't enter by the door into the sheep fold,
  but climbs up some other way,
  is a thief and a robber.

  # John 10:02
  But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.

  # John 10:03
  The gatekeeper opens the gate for him,
  and the sheep listen to his voice.

  He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.

  # John 10:04
  Whenever he brings out his own sheep,
  he goes before them;
  and the sheep follow him,
  for they know his voice.

  # John 10:05
  They will by no means follow a stranger,
  but will flee from him;
  for they don't know the voice of strangers.
}

# John 10:06
Jesus spoke this parable to them,
but they didn't understand what he was telling them.

# John 10:07
Jesus therefore said to them again,
{
  Most certainly,
  I tell you,
  I am the sheep's door.

  # John 10:08
  All who came before me are thieves and robbers,
  but the sheep didn't listen to them.

  # John 10:09
  I am the door.

  If anyone enters in by me,
  he will be saved,
  and will go in and go out and will find pasture.

  # John 10:10
  The thief only comes to steal,
  kill,
  and destroy.

  I came that they may have life,
  and may have it abundantly.

  # John 10:11
  I am the good shepherd.

  The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

  # John 10:12
  He who is a hired hand,
  and not a shepherd,
  who doesn't own the sheep,
  sees the wolf coming,
  leaves the sheep,
  and flees.

  The wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them.

  # John 10:13
  The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand and doesn't care for the sheep.

  # John 10:14
  I am the good shepherd.

  I know my own,
  and I'm known by my own;

  # John 10:15
  even as the Father knows me,
  and I know the Father.

  I lay down my life for the sheep.

  # John 10:16
  I have other sheep which are not of this fold.

  I must bring them also,
  and they will hear my voice.

  They will become one flock with one shepherd.

  # John 10:17
  Therefore the Father loves me,
  because I lay down my life,
  that I may take it again.

  # John 10:18
  No one takes it away from me,
  but I lay it down by myself.

  I have power to lay it down,
  and I have power to take it again.

  I received this commandment from my Father.
}

# John 10:19
Therefore a division arose again among the Jews
because of these words.

# John 10:20
Many of them said,
{
  He has a demon and is insane!

  Why do you listen to him?
}

# John 10:21
Others said,
{
  These are not the sayings of one possessed by a demon.

  It isn't possible
  for a demon to open the eyes of the blind,
  is it?
}

# John 10:22
It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.

# John 10:23
It was winter,
and Jesus was walking in the temple,
in Solomon's porch.

# John 10:24
The Jews therefore came around him and said to him,
{
  How long will you hold us in suspense?

  If you are the Christ,
  tell us plainly.
}

# John 10:25
Jesus answered them,
{
  I told you,
  and you don't believe.

  The works that I do in my Father's name,
  these testify about me.

  # John 10:26
  But you don't believe,
  because you are not of my sheep,
  as I told you.

  # John 10:27
  My sheep hear my voice,
  and I know them,
  and they follow me.

  # John 10:28
  I give eternal life to them.

  They will never perish,
  and no one will snatch them out of my hand.

  # John 10:29
  My Father who has given them to me is greater than all.

  No one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand.

  # John 10:30
  I and the Father are one.
}

# John 10:31
Therefore the Jews took up stones again to stone him.

# John 10:32
Jesus answered them,
{
  I have shown you many good works from my Father.

  For which of those works do you stone me?
}

# John 10:33
The Jews answered him,
{
  We don't stone you for a good work,
  but for blasphemy,
  because you,
  being a man,
  make yourself God.
}

# John 10:34
Jesus answered them,
{
  Isn't it written in your law,
  {
    I said, you are gods?
  }

  # John 10:35
  If he called them gods,
  to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken),
  # John 10:36
  do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world,
  {
    You blaspheme,
  }

  because I said,
  {
    I am the Son of God?
  }

  # John 10:37
  If I don't do the works of my Father,
  don't believe me.

  # John 10:38
  But if I do them,
  though you don't believe me,
  believe the works,
  that you may know and believe that the Father is in me,
  and I in the Father.
}

# John 10:39
They sought again to seize him,
and he went out of their hand.

# John 10:40
He went away again beyond the Jordan
into the place where John was baptizing at first,
and he stayed there.

# John 10:41
Many came to him.

They said,
{
  John indeed did no sign,
  but everything that John said about this man is true.
}

# John 10:42
Many believed in him there.

# John 11:01
Now a certain man was sick,
Lazarus from Bethany,
of the village of Mary and her sister, Martha.

# John 11:02
It was that Mary
  who had anointed the Lord with ointment
  and wiped his feet with her hair,
  whose brother Lazarus was sick.

# John 11:03
The sisters therefore sent to him,
saying,
{
  Lord, behold,
  he for whom you have great affection is sick.
}

# John 11:04
But when Jesus heard it,
he said,
{
  This sickness is not to death,
  but for the glory of God,
  that God's Son may be glorified by it.
}

# John 11:05
Now Jesus loved Martha,
and her sister,
and Lazarus.

# John 11:06
When therefore he heard that he was sick,
he stayed two days in the place where he was.

# John 11:07
Then after this he said to the disciples,
{
  Let's go into Judea again.
}

# John 11:08
The disciples asked him,
{
  Rabbi,
  the Jews were just trying to stone you.

  Are you going there again?
}

# John 11:09
Jesus answered,
{
  Aren't there twelve hours of daylight?

  If a man walks in the day,
  he doesn't stumble,
  because he sees the light of this world.

  # John 11:10
  But if a man walks in the night,
  he stumbles,
  because the light isn't in him.
}

# John 11:11
He said these things,
and after that,
he said to them,
{
  Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep,
  but I am going so that I may awake him out of sleep.
}

# John 11:12
The disciples therefore said,
{
  Lord,
  if he has fallen asleep,
  he will recover.
}

# John 11:13
Now Jesus had spoken of his death,
but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.

# John 11:14
So Jesus said to them plainly then,
{
  Lazarus is dead.

  # John 11:15
  I am glad for your sakes that I was not there,
  so that you may believe.

  Nevertheless,
  let's go to him.
}

# John 11:16
Thomas therefore,
who is called Didymus,
said to his fellow disciples,
{
  Let's also go,
  that we may die with him.
}

# John 11:17
So when Jesus came,
he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.

# John 11:18
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem,
about fifteen stadia away.

# John 11:19
Many of the Jews had joined the women around Martha and Mary,
to console them concerning their brother.

# John 11:20
Then when Martha heard that Jesus was coming,
she went and met him,
but Mary stayed in the house.

# John 11:21
Therefore Martha said to Jesus,
{
  Lord,
  if you would have been here,
  my brother wouldn't have died.

  # John 11:22
  Even now I know that whatever you ask of God,
  God will give you.
}

# John 11:23
Jesus said to her,
{
  Your brother will rise again.
}

# John 11:24
Martha said to him,
{
  I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
}

# John 11:25
Jesus said to her,
{
  I am the resurrection and the life.

  He who believes in me will still live,
  even if he dies.

  # John 11:26
  Whoever lives and believes in me will never die.

  Do you believe this?
}

# John 11:27
She said to him,
{
  Yes, Lord.

  I have come to believe that you are the Christ,
  God's Son,
  he who comes into the world.
}

# John 11:28
When she had said this,
she went away and called Mary, her sister,
secretly, saying,
{
  The Teacher is here and is calling you.
}

# John 11:29
When she heard this,
she arose quickly and went to him.

# John 11:30
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village,
but was in the place where Martha met him.

# John 11:31
Then the Jews who were with her in the house
and were consoling her,
when they saw Mary,
that she rose up quickly and went out,
followed her, saying,
{
  She is going to the tomb to weep there.
}

# John 11:32
Therefore when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him,
she fell down at his feet,
saying to him,
{
  Lord,
  if you would have been here,
  my brother wouldn't have died.
}

# John 11:33
When Jesus therefore saw her weeping,
and the Jews weeping who came with her,
he groaned in the spirit and was troubled,
# John 11:34
and said,
{
  Where have you laid him?
}

They told him,
{
  Lord, come and see.
}

# John 11:35
Jesus wept.

# John 11:36
The Jews therefore said,
{
  See how much affection he had for him!
}

# John 11:37
Some of them said,
{
  Couldn't this man,
  who opened the eyes of him who was blind,
  have also kept this man from dying?
}

# John 11:38
Jesus therefore,
again groaning in himself,
came to the tomb.

Now it was a cave,
and a stone lay against it.

# John 11:39
Jesus said,
{
  Take away the stone.
}

Martha,
the sister of him who was dead,
said to him,
{
  Lord,
  by this time there is a stench,
  for he has been dead four days.
}

# John 11:40
Jesus said to her,
{
  Didn't I tell you that if you believed,
  you would see God's glory?
}

# John 11:41
So they took away the stone
from the place
where the dead man was lying.

Jesus lifted up his eyes and said,
{
  Father,
  I thank you that you listened to me.

  # John 11:42
  I know that you always listen to me,
  but because of the multitude standing around I said this,
  that they may believe that you sent me.
}

# John 11:43
When he had said this,
he cried with a loud voice,
{
  Lazarus, come out!
}

# John 11:44
He who was dead came out,
bound hand and foot with wrappings,
and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.

Jesus said to them,
{
  Free him,
  and let him go.
}

# John 11:45
Therefore many of the Jews
  who came to Mary
  and saw what Jesus did
believed in him.

# John 11:46
But some of them went away to the Pharisees
and told them the things which Jesus had done.

# John 11:47
The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council,
and said,
{
  What are we doing?

  For this man does many signs.

  # John 11:48
  If we leave him alone like this,
  everyone will believe in him,
  and the Romans will come
  and take away both our place and our nation.
}

# John 11:49
But a certain one of them, Caiaphas,
being high priest that year,
said to them,
{
  You know nothing at all,
  # John 11:50
  nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us
  that one man should die for the people,
  and that the whole nation not perish.
}

# John 11:51
Now he didn't say this of himself,
but being high priest that year,
he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
# John 11:52
and not for the nation only,
but that he might also gather together into one
the children of God who are scattered abroad.

# John 11:53
So from that day forward they took counsel
that they might put him to death.

# John 11:54
Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews,
but departed from there into the country near the wilderness,
to a city called Ephraim.

He stayed there with his disciples.

# John 11:55
Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand.

Many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover,
to purify themselves.

# John 11:56
Then they sought for Jesus and spoke with one another as they stood in the temple,
{
  What do you think ---
  that he isn't coming to the feast at all?
}

# John 11:57
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded
that if anyone knew where he was,
he should report it,
that they might seize him.

# John 12:01
Then,
six days before the Passover,
Jesus came to Bethany,
where Lazarus was,
who had been dead,
whom he raised from the dead.

# John 12:02
So they made him a supper there.

Martha served,
but Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.

# John 12:03
Therefore Mary took a pound of ointment of pure nard,
very precious,
and anointed Jesus's feet and wiped his feet with her hair.

The house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.

# John 12:04
Then Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,
one of his disciples,
who would betray him,
said,
# John 12:05
{
  Why wasn't this ointment sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?
}

# John 12:06
Now he said this,
not because he cared for the poor,
but because he was a thief,
and having the money box,
used to steal what was put into it.

# John 12:07
But Jesus said,
{
  Leave her alone.

  She has kept this for the day of my burial.

  # John 12:08
  For you always have the poor with you,
  but you don't always have me.
}

# John 12:09
A large crowd therefore of the Jews learned that he was there;
and they came,
not for Jesus' sake only,
but that they might see Lazarus also,
whom he had raised from the dead.

# John 12:10
But the chief priests conspired to put Lazarus to death also,
# John 12:11
because on account of him
many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.

# John 12:12
On the next day a great multitude had come to the feast.

When they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
# John 12:13
they took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him,
and cried out,
{
  Hosanna!

  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,
  the King of Israel!
}

# John 12:14
Jesus,
having found a young donkey,
sat on it.

As it is written,
# John 12:15
{
  Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion.

  Behold!
  Your King comes,
  sitting on a donkey's colt.
}

# John 12:16
His disciples didn't understand these things at first,
but when Jesus was glorified,
then they remembered that these things were written about him,
and that they had done these things to him.

# John 12:17
The multitude therefore
  that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb
  and raised him from the dead
was testifying about it.

# John 12:18
For this cause also the multitude went and met him,
because they heard that he had done this sign.

# John 12:19
The Pharisees therefore said among themselves,
{
  See how you accomplish nothing.

  Behold!
  The world has gone after him.
}

# John 12:20
Now there were certain Greeks
among those who went up to worship at the feast.

# John 12:21
Therefore,
these came to Philip,
who was from Bethsaida of Galilee,
and asked him,
saying,
{
  Sir, we want to see Jesus.
}

# John 12:22
Philip came and told Andrew,
and in turn,
Andrew came with Philip,
and they told Jesus.

# John 12:23
Jesus answered them,
{
  The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.

  # John 12:24
  Most certainly I tell you,
  unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies,
  it remains by itself alone.

  But if it dies,
  it bears much fruit.

  # John 12:25
  He who loves his life will lose it.

  He who hates his life in this world will keep it to eternal life.

  # John 12:26
  If anyone serves me,
  let him follow me.

  Where I am,
  there my servant will also be.

  If anyone serves me,
  the Father will honor him.

  # John 12:27
  Now my soul is troubled.

  What shall I say?

  {
    Father, save me from this time?
  }

  But I came to this time for this cause.

  # John 12:28
  Father, glorify your name!
}

Then a voice came out of the sky,
saying,
{
  I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.
}

# John 12:29
Therefore the multitude who stood by and heard it
said that it had thundered.

Others said,
{
  An angel has spoken to him.
}

# John 12:30
Jesus answered,
{
  This voice hasn't come for my sake,
  but for your sakes.

  # John 12:31
  Now is the judgment of this world.

  Now the prince of this world will be cast out.

  # John 12:32
  And I,
  if I am lifted up from the earth,
  will draw all people to myself.
}

# John 12:33
But he said this,
signifying by what kind of death he should die.

# John 12:34
The multitude answered him,
{
  We have heard out of the law that the Christ remains forever.

  How do you say,
  {
    The Son of Man must be lifted up?
  }

  Who is this Son of Man?
}

# John 12:35
Jesus therefore said to them,
{
  Yet a little while the light is with you.

  Walk while you have the light,
  that darkness doesn't overtake you.

  He who walks in the darkness doesn't know where he is going.

  # John 12:36
  While you have the light,
  believe in the light,
  that you may become children of light.
}

Jesus said these things,
and he departed and hid himself from them.

# John 12:37
But though he had done so many signs before them,
yet they didn't believe in him,
# John 12:38
that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,
which he spoke:
{
  Lord, who has believed our report?

  To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
}

# John 12:39
For this cause they couldn't believe,
for Isaiah said again:

# John 12:40
{
  He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart,
  lest they should see with their eyes,
  and perceive with their heart,
  and would turn,
  and I would heal them.
}

# John 12:41
Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory,
and spoke of him.

# John 12:42
Nevertheless,
even many of the rulers believed in him,
but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it,
so that they wouldn't be put out of the synagogue,

# John 12:43
for they loved men's praise more than God's praise.

# John 12:44
Jesus cried out and said,
{
  Whoever believes in me,
  believes not in me,
  but in him who sent me.

  # John 12:45
  He who sees me sees him who sent me.

  # John 12:46
  I have come as a light into the world,
  that whoever believes in me may not remain in the darkness.

  # John 12:47
  If anyone listens to my sayings and doesn't believe,
  I don't judge him.

  For I came not to judge the world,
  but to save the world.

  # John 12:48
  He who rejects me,
  and doesn't receive my sayings,
  has one who judges him.

  The word that I spoke will judge him in the last day.

  # John 12:49
  For I spoke not from myself,
  but the Father who sent me gave me a commandment,
  what I should say and what I should speak.

  # John 12:50
  I know that his commandment is eternal life.

  The things therefore which I speak,
  even as the Father has said to me,
  so I speak.
}

# John 13:01
Now before the feast of the Passover,
Jesus,
knowing that his time had come that he would depart from this world to the Father,
having loved his own who were in the world,
he loved them to the end.

# John 13:02
During supper,
the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot,
  Simon's son,
to betray him,
# John 13:03
Jesus,
knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands,
and that he came from God and was going to God,
# John 13:04
arose from supper,
and laid aside his outer garments.

He took a towel and wrapped a towel around his waist.

# John 13:05
Then he poured water into the basin,
and began to wash the disciples' feet
and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.

# John 13:06
Then he came to Simon Peter.

He said to him,
{
  Lord, do you wash my feet?
}

# John 13:07
Jesus answered him,
{
  You don't know what I am doing now,
  but you will understand later.
}

# John 13:08
Peter said to him,
{
  You will never wash my feet!
}

Jesus answered him,
{
  If I don't wash you,
  you have no part with me.
}

# John 13:09
Simon Peter said to him,
{
  Lord,
  not my feet only,
  but also my hands and my head!
}

# John 13:10
Jesus said to him,
{
  Someone who has bathed only needs to have his feet washed,
  but is completely clean.

  You are clean,
  but not all of you.
}

# John 13:11
For he knew him who would betray him;
therefore he said,
{
  You are not all clean.
}

# John 13:12
So when he had washed their feet,
put his outer garment back on,
and sat down again,
he said to them,
{
  Do you know what I have done to you?

  # John 13:13
  You call me,
  {
    Teacher
  }

  and 
  {
    Lord.
  }

  You say so correctly,
  for so I am.

  # John 13:14
  If I then,
  the Lord and the Teacher,
  have washed your feet,
  you also ought to wash one another's feet.

  # John 13:15
  For I have given you an example,
  that you should also do as I have done to you.

  # John 13:16
  Most certainly I tell you,
  a servant is not greater than his lord,
  neither is one who is sent greater than he who sent him.

  # John 13:17
  If you know these things,
  blessed are you if you do them.

  # John 13:18
  I don't speak concerning all of you.

  I know whom I have chosen;
  but that the Scripture may be fulfilled,
  {
    He who eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.
  }

  # John 13:19
  From now on,
  I tell you before it happens,
  that when it happens,
  you may believe that I am he.

  # John 13:20
  Most certainly I tell you,
  he who receives whomever I send,
  receives me;
  and he who receives me,
  receives him who sent me.
}

# John 13:21
When Jesus had said this,
he was troubled in spirit,
and testified,
{
  Most certainly I tell you that one of you will betray me.
}

# John 13:22
The disciples looked at one another,
perplexed about whom he spoke.

# John 13:23
One of his disciples,
whom Jesus loved,
was at the table,
leaning against Jesus' breast.

# John 13:24
Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him,
and said to him,
{
  Tell us who it is of whom he speaks.
}

# John 13:25
He,
leaning back,
as he was,
on Jesus' breast,
asked him,
{
  Lord, who is it?
}

# John 13:26
Jesus therefore answered,
{
  It is he to whom I will give this piece of bread
  when I have dipped it.
}

So when he had dipped the piece of bread,
he gave it to Judas,
the son of Simon Iscariot.

# John 13:27
After the piece of bread,
then Satan entered into him.

Then Jesus said to him,
{
  What you do, do quickly.
}

# John 13:28
Now nobody at the table knew why he said this to him.

# John 13:29
For some thought,
because Judas had the money box,
that Jesus said to him,
{
  Buy what things we need for the feast,
}

or that he should give something to the poor.

# John 13:30
Therefore having received that morsel,
he went out immediately.

It was night.

# John 13:31
When he had gone out,
Jesus said,
{
  Now the Son of Man has been glorified,
  and God has been glorified in him.

  # John 13:32
  If God has been glorified in him,
  God will also glorify him in himself,
  and he will glorify him immediately.

  # John 13:33
  Little children,
  I will be with you a little while longer.

  You will seek me,
  and as I said to the Jews,
  {
    Where I am going,
    you can't come,
  }

  so now I tell you.

  # John 13:34
  A new commandment I give to you,
  that you love one another.

  Just as I have loved you,
  you also love one another.

  # John 13:35
  By this everyone will know that you are my disciples,
  if you have love for one another.
}

# John 13:36
Simon Peter said to him,
{
  Lord, where are you going?
}

Jesus answered,
{
  Where I am going,
  you can't follow now,
  but you will follow afterwards.
}

# John 13:37
Peter said to him,
{
  Lord, why can't I follow you now?

  I will lay down my life for you.
}

# John 13:38
Jesus answered him,
{
  Will you lay down your life for me?

  Most certainly I tell you,
  the rooster won't crow until you have denied me three times.
}

# John 14:01
{
  Don't let your heart be troubled.

  Believe in God.

  Believe also in me.

  # John 14:02
  In my Father's house are many homes.

  If it weren't so,
  I would have told you.

  I am going to prepare a place for you.

  # John 14:03
  If I go and prepare a place for you,
  I will come again and will receive you to myself;
  that where I am,
  you may be there also.

  # John 14:04
  You know where I go,
  and you know the way.
}

# John 14:05
Thomas said to him,
{
  Lord,
  we don't know where you are going.

  How can we know the way?
}

# John 14:06
Jesus said to him,
{
  I am the way,
  the truth,
  and the life.

  No one comes to the Father,
  except through me.

  # John 14:07
  If you had known me,
  you would have known my Father also.

  From now on,
  you know him and have seen him.
}

# John 14:08
Philip said to him,
{
  Lord,
  show us the Father,
  and that will be enough for us.
}

# John 14:09
Jesus said to him,
{
  Have I been with you such a long time,
  and do you not know me, Philip?

  He who has seen me has seen the Father.

  How do you say,
  {
    Show us the Father?
  }

  # John 14:10
  Don't you believe that I am in the Father,
  and the Father in me?

  The words that I tell you,
  I speak not from myself;
  but the Father who lives in me does his works.

  # John 14:11
  Believe me that I am in the Father,
  and the Father in me;
  or else believe me for the very works' sake.

  # John 14:12
  Most certainly I tell you,
  he who believes in me,
  the works that I do,
  he will do also;
  and he will do greater works than these,
  because I am going to my Father.

  # John 14:13
  Whatever you will ask in my name,
  I will do it,
  that the Father may be glorified in the Son.

  # John 14:14
  If you will ask anything in my name,
  I will do it.

  # John 14:15
  If you love me,
  keep my commandments.

  # John 14:16
  I will pray to the Father,
  and he will give you another Counselor,
  that he may be with you forever:
  # John 14:17
  the Spirit of truth,
  whom the world can't receive,
  for it doesn't see him and doesn't know him.

  You know him,
  for he lives with you and will be in you.

  # John 14:18
  I will not leave you orphans.

  I will come to you.

  # John 14:19
  Yet a little while,
  and the world will see me no more;
  but you will see me.

  Because I live,
  you will live also.

  # John 14:20
  In that day you will know that I am in my Father,
  and you in me,
  and I in you.

  # John 14:21
  One who has my commandments and keeps them,
  that person is one who loves me.

  One who loves me will be loved by my Father,
  and I will love him,
  and will reveal myself to him.
}

# John 14:22
Judas (not Iscariot) said to him,
{
  Lord,
  what has happened that you are about to reveal yourself to us,
  and not to the world?
}

# John 14:23
Jesus answered him,
{
  If a man loves me,
  he will keep my word.

  My Father will love him,
  and we will come to him and make our home with him.

  # John 14:24
  He who doesn't love me doesn't keep my words.

  The word which you hear isn't mine,
  but the Father's who sent me.

  # John 14:25
  I have said these things to you while still living with you.

  # John 14:26
  But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit,
  whom the Father will send in my name,
  will teach you all things,
  and will remind you of all that I said to you.

  # John 14:27
  Peace I leave with you.

  My peace I give to you;
  not as the world gives,
  I give to you.

  Don't let your heart be troubled,
  neither let it be fearful.

  # John 14:28
  You heard how I told you,
  {
    I am going away,
    and I will come back to you.
  }

  If you loved me,
  you would have rejoiced because I said
  {
    I am going to my Father;
  }

  for the Father is greater than I.

  # John 14:29
  Now I have told you before it happens so that when it happens,
  you may believe.

  # John 14:30
  I will no more speak much with you,
  for the prince of the world comes,
  and he has nothing in me.

  # John 14:31
  But that the world may know that I love the Father,
  and as the Father commanded me,
  even so I do.

  Arise,
  let's go from here.
}

# John 15:01
{
  I am the true vine,
  and my Father is the farmer.

  # John 15:02
  Every branch in me that doesn't bear fruit,
  he takes away.

  Every branch that bears fruit,
  he prunes,
  that it may bear more fruit.

  # John 15:03
  You are already pruned clean
    because of the word
      which I have spoken to you.

  # John 15:04
  Remain in me,
  and I in you.

  As the branch can't bear fruit by itself
  unless it remains in the vine,
  so neither can you,
  unless you remain in me.

  # John 15:05
  I am the vine.

  You are the branches.

  He who remains in me and I in him bears much fruit,
  for apart from me you can do nothing.

  # John 15:06
  If a man doesn't remain in me,
  he is thrown out as a branch and is withered;
  and they gather them,
  throw them into the fire,
  and they are burned.

  # John 15:07
  If you remain in me,
  and my words remain in you,
  you will ask whatever you desire,
  and it will be done for you.

  # John 15:08
  In this my Father is glorified,
  that you bear much fruit;
  and so you will be my disciples.

  # John 15:09
  Even as the Father has loved me,
  I also have loved you.

  Remain in my love.

  # John 15:10
  If you keep my commandments,
  you will remain in my love,
  even as I have kept my Father's commandments and remain in his love.

  # John 15:11
  I have spoken these things to you,
  that my joy may remain in you,
  and that your joy may be made full.

  # John 15:12
  This is my commandment,
  that you love one another,
  even as I have loved you.

  # John 15:13
  Greater love has no one than this,
  that someone lay down his life for his friends.

  # John 15:14
  You are my friends if you do whatever I command you.

  # John 15:15
  No longer do I call you servants,
  for the servant doesn't know what his lord does.

  But I have called you friends,
  for everything that I heard from my Father,
  I have made known to you.

  # John 15:16
  You didn't choose me,
  but I chose you and appointed you,
  that you should go and bear fruit,
  and that your fruit should remain;
  that whatever you will ask of the Father in my name,
  he may give it to you.

  # John 15:17
  I command these things to you,
  that you may love one another.

  # John 15:18
  If the world hates you,
  you know that it has hated me before it hated you.

  # John 15:19
  If you were of the world,
  the world would love its own.

  But because you are not of the world,
  since I chose you out of the world,
  therefore the world hates you.

  # John 15:20
  Remember the word that I said to you:
  {
    A servant is not greater than his lord.
  }

  If they persecuted me,
  they will also persecute you.

  If they kept my word,
  they will also keep yours.

  # John 15:21
  But they will do all these things to you for my name's sake,
  because they don't know him who sent me.

  # John 15:22
  If I had not come and spoken to them,
  they would not have had sin;
  but now they have no excuse for their sin.

  # John 15:23
  He who hates me,
  hates my Father also.

  # John 15:24
  If I hadn't done among them the works which no one else did,
  they wouldn't have had sin.

  But now they have seen and also hated both me and my Father.

  # John 15:25
  But this happened so that the word may be fulfilled which was written in their law,
  {
    They hated me without a cause.
  }

  # John 15:26
  When the Counselor has come,
  whom I will send to you from the Father,
  the Spirit of truth,
  who proceeds from the Father,
  he will testify about me.

  # John 15:27
  You will also testify,
  because you have been with me from the beginning.

  # John 16:01
  I have said these things to you
  so that you wouldn't be caused to stumble.

  # John 16:02
  They will put you out of the synagogues.

  Yes,
  the time is coming that whoever kills you will think that he offers service to God.

  # John 16:03
  They will do these things because they have not known the Father nor me.

  # John 16:04
  But I have told you these things so that when the time comes,
  you may remember that I told you about them.

  I didn't tell you these things from the beginning,
  because I was with you.

  # John 16:05
  But now I am going to him who sent me,
  and none of you asks me,
  {
    Where are you going?
  }

  # John 16:06
  But because I have told you these things,
  sorrow has filled your heart.

  # John 16:07
  Nevertheless I tell you the truth:
  It is to your advantage that I go away;
  for if I don't go away,
  the Counselor won't come to you.

  But if I go,
  I will send him to you.

  # John 16:08
  When he has come,
  he will convict the world
    about sin,
    about righteousness,
    and about judgment;
  # John 16:09
  about sin,
    because they don't believe in me;
  # John 16:10
  about righteousness,
    because I am going to my Father,
    and you won't see me any more;
  # John 16:11
  about judgment,
    because the prince of this world has been judged.

  # John 16:12
  I still have many things to tell you,
  but you can't bear them now.

  # John 16:13
  However,
  when he,
  the Spirit of truth,
  has come,
  he will guide you into all truth,
  for he will not speak from himself;
  but whatever he hears,
  he will speak.

  He will declare to you things that are coming.

  # John 16:14
  He will glorify me,
  for he will take from what is mine and will declare it to you.

  # John 16:15
  All things that the Father has are mine;
  therefore I said that he takes of mine and will declare it to you.

  # John 16:16
  A little while,
  and you will not see me.

  Again a little while,
  and you will see me.
}

# Section: Some of his disciples therefore said to one another
# John 16:17
Some of his disciples therefore said to one another,
{
  What is this that he says to us,
  {
    A little while,
    and you won't see me,
    and again a little while,
    and you will see me;
  }

  and,
  {
    Because I go to the Father
  }
  ?
}

# John 16:18
They said therefore,
{
  What is this that he says,
  {
    A little while
  }
  ?

  We don't know what he is saying.
}

# John 16:19
Therefore Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him,
and he said to them,
{
  Do you inquire among yourselves concerning this,
  that I said,
  {
    A little while,
    and you won't see me,
    and again a little while,
    and you will see me?
  }

  # John 16:20
  Most certainly I tell you that you will weep and lament,
  but the world will rejoice.

  You will be sorrowful,
  but your sorrow will be turned into joy.

  # John 16:21
  A woman,
  when she gives birth,
  has sorrow because her time has come.

  But when she has delivered the child,
  she doesn't remember the anguish any more,
  for the joy that a human being is born into the world.

  # John 16:22
  Therefore you now have sorrow,
  but I will see you again,
  and your heart will rejoice,
  and no one will take your joy away from you.

  # John 16:23
  ``In that day you will ask me no questions.

  Most certainly I tell you,
  whatever you may ask of the Father in my name,
  he will give it to you.

  # John 16:24
  Until now,
  you have asked nothing in my name.

  Ask,
  and you will receive,
  that your joy may be made full.

  # John 16:25
  ``I have spoken these things to you in figures of speech.

  But the time is coming when I will no more speak to you in figures of speech,
  but will tell you plainly about the Father.

  # John 16:26
  In that day you will ask in my name;
  and I don't say to you that I will pray to the Father for you,

  # John 16:27
  for the Father himself loves you,
  because you have loved me,
  and have believed that I came from God.

  # John 16:28
  I came from the Father and have come into the world.

  Again,
  I leave the world and go to the Father.
}

# John 16:29
His disciples said to him,
{
  Behold,
  now you are speaking plainly,
  and using no figures of speech.

  # John 16:30
  Now we know that you know all things,
  and don't need for anyone to question you.

  By this we believe that you came from God.
}

# John 16:31
Jesus answered them,
{
  Do you now believe?

  # John 16:32
  Behold,
  the time is coming,
  yes,
  and has now come,
  that you will be scattered,
  everyone to his own place,
  and you will leave me alone.

  Yet I am not alone,
  because the Father is with me.

  # John 16:33
  I have told you these things,
  that in me you may have peace.

  In the world you have trouble;
  but cheer up!

  I have overcome the world.
}

# John 17:01
Jesus said these things,
then lifting up his eyes to heaven,
he said,
{
  Father, the time has come.

  Glorify your Son,
  that your Son may also glorify you;
  # John 17:02
  even as you gave him authority over all flesh,
  so he will give eternal life
  to all whom you have given him.

  # John 17:03
  This is eternal life,
  that they should know you,
  the only true God,
  and him whom you sent,
  Jesus Christ.

  # John 17:04
  I glorified you on the earth.

  I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.

  # John 17:05
  Now, Father,
  glorify me with your own self
  with the glory which I had with you
  before the world existed.

  # John 17:06
  I revealed your name to the people
  whom you have given me out of the world.

  They were yours,
  and you have given them to me.

  They have kept your word.

  # John 17:07
  Now they have known that all things whatever
  you have given me are from you,
  # John 17:08
  for the words which you have given me I have given to them;
  and they received them,
  and knew for sure that I came from you.

  They have believed that you sent me.

  # John 17:09
  I pray for them.

  I don't pray for the world,
  but for those whom you have given me,
  for they are yours.

  # John 17:10
  All things that are mine are yours,
  and yours are mine,
  and I am glorified in them.

  # John 17:11
  I am no more in the world,
  but these are in the world,
  and I am coming to you.

  Holy Father,
  keep them through your name which you have given me,
  that they may be one,
  even as we are.

  # John 17:12
  While I was with them in the world,
  I kept them in your name.

  I have kept those whom you have given me.

  None of them is lost except the son of destruction,
  that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

  # John 17:13
  But now I come to you,
  and I say these things in the world,
  that they may have my joy made full in themselves.

  # John 17:14
  I have given them your word.

  The world hated them because they are not of the world,
  even as I am not of the world.

  # John 17:15
  I pray not that you would take them from the world,
  but that you would keep them from the evil one.

  # John 17:16
  They are not of the world,
  even as I am not of the world.

  # John 17:17
  Sanctify them in your truth.

  Your word is truth.

  # John 17:18
  As you sent me into the world,
  even so I have sent them into the world.

  # John 17:19
  For their sakes I sanctify myself,
  that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.

  # John 17:20
  Not for these only do I pray,
  but for those also who will believe in me through their word,
  # John 17:21
  that they may all be one;
  even as you,
  Father,
  are in me,
  and I in you,
  that they also may be one in us;
  that the world may believe that you sent me.

  # John 17:22
  The glory which you have given me,
  I have given to them,
  that they may be one,
  even as we are one,
  # John 17:23
  I in them,
  and you in me,
  that they may be perfected into one,
  that the world may know that you sent me and loved them,
  even as you loved me.

  # John 17:24
  Father,
  I desire that they also whom you have given me
  be with me where I am,
  that they may see my glory which you have given me,
  for you loved me before the foundation of the world.

  # John 17:25
  Righteous Father,
  the world hasn't known you,
  but I knew you;
  and these knew that you sent me.

  # John 17:26
  I made known to them your name,
  and will make it known;
  that the love with which you loved me may be in them,
  and I in them.
}

# John 18:01
When Jesus had spoken these words,
he went out with his disciples over the brook Kidron,
where there was a garden,
into which he and his disciples entered.

# John 18:02
Now Judas,
who betrayed him,
also knew the place,
for Jesus often met there with his disciples.

# John 18:03
Judas then,
having taken a detachment of soldiers and officers
from the chief priests and the Pharisees,
came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.

# John 18:04
Jesus therefore,
knowing all the things that were happening to him,
went out and said to them,
{
  Who are you looking for?
}

# John 18:05
They answered him,
{
  Jesus of Nazareth.
}

Jesus said to them,
{
  I am he.
}

Judas also,
who betrayed him,
was standing with them.

# John 18:06
When therefore he said to them,
{
  I am he,
}

they went backward and fell to the ground.

# John 18:07
Again therefore he asked them,
{
  Who are you looking for?
}

They said,
{
  Jesus of Nazareth.
}

# John 18:08
Jesus answered,
{
  I told you that I am he.

  If therefore you seek me,
  let these go their way,
}

# John 18:09
that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke,
{
  Of those whom you have given me,
  I have lost none.
}

# John 18:10
Simon Peter therefore,
having a sword,
drew it,
struck the high priest's servant,
and cut off his right ear.

The servant's name was Malchus.

# John 18:11
Jesus therefore said to Peter,
{
  Put the sword into its sheath.

  The cup which the Father has given me,
  shall I not surely drink it?
}

# John 18:12
So the detachment,
the commanding officer,
and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and bound him,
# John 18:13
and led him to Annas first,
for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas,
who was high priest that year.

# John 18:14
Now it was Caiaphas who advised the Jews
that it was expedient
that one man should perish for the people.

# John 18:15
Simon Peter followed Jesus,
as did another disciple.

Now that disciple was known to the high priest,
and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;
# John 18:16
but Peter was standing at the door outside.

So the other disciple,
who was known to the high priest,
went out and spoke to her who kept the door,
and brought in Peter.

# John 18:17
Then the maid who kept the door said to Peter,
{
  Are you also one of this man's disciples?
}

He said,
{
  I am not.
}

# John 18:18
Now the servants and the officers were standing there,
having made a fire of coals,
for it was cold.

They were warming themselves.

Peter was with them,
standing and warming himself.

# John 18:19
The high priest therefore asked Jesus
about his disciples and about his teaching.

# John 18:20
Jesus answered him,
{
  I spoke openly to the world.

  I always taught in synagogues and in the temple,
  where the Jews always meet.

  I said nothing in secret.

  # John 18:21
  Why do you ask me?

  Ask those who have heard me what I said to them.

  Behold,
  they know the things which I said.
}

# John 18:22
When he had said this,
one of the officers standing by slapped Jesus with his hand,
saying,
{
  Do you answer the high priest like that?
}

# John 18:23
Jesus answered him,
{
  If I have spoken evil,
  testify of the evil;
  but if well,
  why do you beat me?
}

# John 18:24
Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas,
the high priest.

# John 18:25
Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself.

They said therefore to him,
{
  You aren't also one of his disciples,
  are you?
}

He denied it and said,
{
  I am not.
}

# John 18:26
One of the servants of the high priest,
being a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off,
said,
{
  Didn't I see you in the garden with him?
}

# John 18:27
Peter therefore denied it again,
and immediately the rooster crowed.

# John 18:28
They led Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium.

It was early,
and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium,
that they might not be defiled,
but might eat the Passover.

# John 18:29
Pilate therefore went out to them and said,
{
  What accusation do you bring against this man?
}

# John 18:30
They answered him,
{
  If this man weren't an evildoer,
  we wouldn't have delivered him up to you.
}

# John 18:31
Pilate therefore said to them,
{
  Take him yourselves,
  and judge him according to your law.
}

Therefore the Jews said to him,
{
  It is illegal for us to put anyone to death,
}

# John 18:32
that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled,
which he spoke,
signifying by what kind of death he should die.

# John 18:33
Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium,
called Jesus,
and said to him,
{
  Are you the King of the Jews?
}

# John 18:34
Jesus answered him,
{
  Do you say this by yourself,
  or did others tell you about me?
}

# John 18:35
Pilate answered,
{
  I'm not a Jew,
am I?

Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me.

What have you done?''

# John 18:36
Jesus answered,
{
  My Kingdom is not of this world.

  If my Kingdom were of this world,
  then my servants would fight,
  that I wouldn't be delivered to the Jews.

  But now my Kingdom is not from here.
}

# John 18:37
Pilate therefore said to him,
{
  Are you a king then?
}

Jesus answered,
{
  You say that I am a king.

  For this reason I have been born,
  and for this reason I have come into the world,
  that I should testify to the truth.

  Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice.
}

# John 18:38
Pilate said to him,
{
  What is truth?
}

When he had said this,
he went out again to the Jews,
and said to them,
{
  I find no basis for a charge against him.

  # John 18:39
  But you have a custom that I should release someone to you at the Passover.

  Therefore,
  do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?
}

# John 18:40
Then they all shouted again,
saying,
{
  Not this man, but Barabbas!
}

Now Barabbas was a robber.

# John 19:01
So Pilate then took Jesus and flogged him.

# John 19:02
The soldiers twisted thorns into a crown and put it on his head,
and dressed him in a purple garment.

# John 19:03
They kept saying,
{
  Hail, King of the Jews!
}

and they kept slapping him.

# John 19:04
Then Pilate went out again,
and said to them,
{
  Behold!

  I bring him out to you,
  that you may know that I find no basis for a charge against him.
}

# John 19:05
Jesus therefore came out,
wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment.

Pilate said to them,
{
  Behold, the man!
}

# John 19:06
When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him,
they shouted, saying,
{
  Crucify!

  Crucify!
}

Pilate said to them,
{
  Take him yourselves and crucify him,
  for I find no basis for a charge against him.
}

# John 19:07
The Jews answered him,
{
  We have a law,
  and by our law he ought to die,
  because he made himself the Son of God.
}

# John 19:08
When therefore Pilate heard this saying,
he was more afraid.

# John 19:09
He entered into the Praetorium again,
and said to Jesus,
{
  Where are you from?
}

But Jesus gave him no answer.

# John 19:10
Pilate therefore said to him,
{
  Aren't you speaking to me?

  Don't you know
  that I have power
  to release you
  and have power to crucify you?
}

# John 19:11
Jesus answered,
{
  You would have no power at all against me,
  unless it were given to you from above.

  Therefore he who delivered me to you has greater sin.
}

# John 19:12
At this,
Pilate was seeking to release him,
but the Jews cried out, saying,
{
  If you release this man,
  you aren't Caesar's friend!

  Everyone who makes himself a king speaks against Caesar!
}

# John 19:13
When Pilate therefore heard these words,
he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called
{
  The Pavement
}
,

but in Hebrew,
{
  Gabbatha.
}

# John 19:14
Now it was the Preparation Day of the Passover,
at about the sixth hour.

He said to the Jews,
{
  Behold, your King!
}

# John 19:15
They cried out,
{
  Away with him!

  Away with him!

  Crucify him!
}

Pilate said to them,
{
  Shall I crucify your King?
}

The chief priests answered,
{
  We have no king but Caesar!
}

# John 19:16
So then he delivered him to them to be crucified.

So they took Jesus and led him away.

# John 19:17
He went out,
bearing his cross,
to the place called
{
  The Place of a Skull
}
,

which is called in Hebrew,
{
  Golgotha
}
,

# John 19:18
where they crucified him,
and with him two others,
on either side one,
and Jesus in the middle.

# John 19:19
Pilate wrote a title also,
and put it on the cross.

There was written,
{
  JESUS OF NAZARETH,
  THE KING OF THE JEWS.
}

# John 19:20
Therefore many of the Jews read this title,
for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city;
and it was written in Hebrew,
in Latin,
and in Greek.

# John 19:21
The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate,
{
  Don't write,
  {
    The King of the Jews,
  }

  but,
  {
    he said,
    {
      I am King of the Jews.
    }
  }
}

# John 19:22
Pilate answered,
{
  What I have written,
  I have written.
}

# John 19:23
Then the soldiers,
when they had crucified Jesus,
took his garments and made four parts,
to every soldier a part;
and also the tunic.

Now the tunic was without seam,
woven from the top throughout.

# John 19:24
Then they said to one another,
{
  Let's not tear it,
  but cast lots for it to decide whose it will be,
}

that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
which says,
{
  They parted my garments among them.

  They cast lots for my clothing.
}

Therefore the soldiers did these things.

# John 19:25
But standing by Jesus' cross were
  his mother,
  his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,
  and Mary Magdalene.

# John 19:26
Therefore when Jesus saw his mother,
and the disciple whom he loved standing there,
he said to his mother,
{
  Woman, behold, your son!
}

# John 19:27
Then he said to the disciple,
{
  Behold, your mother!
}

From that hour,
the disciple took her to his own home.

# John 19:28
After this,
Jesus, seeing that all things were now finished,
that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
said,
{
  I am thirsty!
}

# John 19:29
Now a vessel full of vinegar was set there;
so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop,
and held it at his mouth.

# John 19:30
When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar,
he said,
{
  It is finished!
}

Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

# John 19:31
Therefore the Jews,
because it was the Preparation Day,
so that the bodies wouldn't remain on the cross on the Sabbath
(for that Sabbath was a special one),
asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken
and that they might be taken away.

# John 19:32
Therefore the soldiers came
and broke the legs of the first
and of the other who was crucified with him;
# John 19:33
but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead,
they didn't break his legs.

# John 19:34
However,
one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear,
and immediately blood and water came out.

# John 19:35
He who has seen has testified,
and his testimony is true.

He knows that he tells the truth,
that you may believe.

# John 19:36
For these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
{
  A bone of him will not be broken.
}

# John 19:37
Again another Scripture says,
{
  They will look on him whom they pierced.
}

# John 19:38
After these things,
Joseph of Arimathaea,
being a disciple of Jesus,
but secretly for fear of the Jews,
asked of Pilate that he might take away Jesus' body.

Pilate gave him permission.

He came therefore and took away his body.

# John 19:39
Nicodemus,
who at first came to Jesus by night,
also came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
about a hundred Roman pounds.

# John 19:40
So they took Jesus' body,
and bound it in linen cloths with the spices,
as the custom of the Jews is to bury.

# John 19:41
Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden.

In the garden was a new tomb in which no man had ever yet been laid.

# John 19:42
Then,
because of the Jews' Preparation Day (for the tomb was near at hand),
they laid Jesus there.

# John 20:01
Now on the first day of the week,
Mary Magdalene went early,
while it was still dark,
to the tomb,
and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.

# John 20:02
Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved,
and said to them,
{
  They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb,
  and we don't know where they have laid him!
}

# John 20:03
Therefore Peter and the other disciple went out,
and they went toward the tomb.

# John 20:04
They both ran together.

The other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first.

# John 20:05
Stooping and looking in,
he saw the linen cloths lying there;
yet he didn't enter in.

# John 20:06
Then Simon Peter came,
following him,
and entered into the tomb.

He saw the linen cloths lying,

# John 20:07
and the cloth that had been on his head,
not lying with the linen cloths,
but rolled up in a place by itself.

# John 20:08
So then the other disciple who came first to the tomb also entered in,
and he saw and believed.

# John 20:09
For as yet they didn't know the Scripture,
that he must rise from the dead.

# John 20:10
So the disciples went away again to their own homes.

# John 20:11
But Mary was standing outside at the tomb weeping.

So as she wept,
she stooped and looked into the tomb,

# John 20:12
and she saw two angels in white sitting,
one at the head and one at the feet,
where the body of Jesus had lain.

# John 20:13
They asked her,
{
  Woman, why are you weeping?
}

She said to them,
{
  Because they have taken away my Lord,
  and I don't know where they have laid him.
}

# John 20:14
When she had said this,
she turned around and saw Jesus standing,
and didn't know that it was Jesus.

# John 20:15
Jesus said to her,
{
  Woman, why are you weeping?

  Who are you looking for?
}

She,
supposing him to be the gardener,
said to him,
{
  Sir,
  if you have carried him away,
  tell me where you have laid him,
  and I will take him away.
}

# John 20:16
Jesus said to her,
{
  Mary.
}

She turned and said to him,
{
  Rabboni!
}

which is to say,
{
  Teacher!
}

# John 20:17
Jesus said to her,
{
  Don't hold me,
  for I haven't yet ascended to my Father;
  but go to my brothers and tell them,
  {
    I am ascending to my Father and your Father,
    to my God and your God.
  }
}

# John 20:18
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord,
and that he had said these things to her.

# John 20:19
When therefore it was evening on that day,
the first day of the week,
and when the doors were locked where the disciples were assembled,
for fear of the Jews,
Jesus came and stood in the middle and said to them,
{
  Peace be to you.
}

# John 20:20
When he had said this,
he showed them his hands and his side.

The disciples therefore were glad when they saw the Lord.

# John 20:21
Jesus therefore said to them again,
{
  Peace be to you.

  As the Father has sent me,
  even so I send you.
}

# John 20:22
When he had said this,
he breathed on them,
and said to them,
{
  Receive the Holy Spirit!

  # John 20:23
  If you forgive anyone's sins,
  they have been forgiven them.

  If you retain anyone's sins,
  they have been retained.
}

# John 20:24
But Thomas,
one of the twelve,
called Didymus,
wasn't with them when Jesus came.

# John 20:25
The other disciples therefore said to him,
{
  We have seen the Lord!
}

But he said to them,
{
  Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails,
  put my finger into the print of the nails,
  and put my hand into his side,
  I will not believe.
}

# John 20:26
After eight days,
again his disciples were inside and Thomas was with them.

Jesus came,
the doors being locked,
and stood in the middle,
and said,
{
  Peace be to you.
}

# John 20:27
Then he said to Thomas,
{
  Reach here your finger,
  and see my hands.

  Reach here your hand,
  and put it into my side.

  Don't be unbelieving,
  but believing.
}

# John 20:28
Thomas answered him,
{
  My Lord and my God!
}

# John 20:29
Jesus said to him,
{
  Because you have seen me,
  you have believed.

  Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.
}

# John 20:30
Therefore
Jesus did many other signs
in the presence of his disciples,
which are not written in this book;
# John 20:31
but these are written
that you may believe
that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
and that believing
you may have life in his name.

# John 21:01
After these things,
Jesus revealed himself again
to the disciples
at the sea of Tiberias.

He revealed himself this way.

# John 21:02
Simon Peter,
Thomas called Didymus,
Nathanael of Cana in Galilee,
and the sons of Zebedee,
and two others of his disciples were together.

# John 21:03
Simon Peter said to them,
{
  I'm going fishing.
}

They told him,
{
  We are also coming with you.
}

They immediately went out and entered into the boat.

That night,
they caught nothing.

# John 21:04
But when day had already come,
Jesus stood on the beach;
yet the disciples didn't know that it was Jesus.

# John 21:05
Jesus therefore said to them,
{
  Children, have you anything to eat?
}

They answered him,
{
  No.
}

# John 21:06
He said to them,
{
  Cast the net on the right side of the boat,
  and you will find some.
}

They cast it therefore,
and now they weren't able to draw it in
for the multitude of fish.

# John 21:07
That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved said to Peter,
{
  It's the Lord!
}

So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
he wrapped his coat around himself (for he was naked),
and threw himself into the sea.

# John 21:08
But the other disciples came in the little boat
(for they were not far from the land,
but about two hundred cubits away),
dragging the net full of fish.

# John 21:09
So when they got out on the land,
they saw a fire of coals there,
with fish and bread laid on it.

# John 21:10
Jesus said to them,
{
  Bring some of the fish which you have just caught.
}

# John 21:11
Simon Peter went up,
and drew the net to land,
full of one hundred fifty-three great fish.

Even though there were so many,
the net wasn't torn.

# John 21:12
Jesus said to them,
{
  Come and eat breakfast!
}

None of the disciples dared inquire of him,
{
  Who are you?
}

knowing that it was the Lord.

# John 21:13
Then Jesus came and took the bread,
gave it to them,
and the fish likewise.

# John 21:14
This is now the third time
that Jesus was revealed to his disciples
after he had risen from the dead.

# John 21:15
So when they had eaten their breakfast,
Jesus said to Simon Peter,
{
  Simon, son of Jonah,
  do you love me more than these?
}

He said to him,
{
  Yes, Lord;
  you know that I have affection for you.
}

He said to him,
{
  Feed my lambs.
}

# John 21:16
He said to him again a second time,
{
  Simon, son of Jonah,
  do you love me?
}

He said to him,
{
  Yes, Lord;
  you know that I have affection for you.
}

He said to him,
{
  Tend my sheep.
}

# John 21:17
He said to him the third time,
{
  Simon, son of Jonah,
  do you have affection for me?
}

Peter was grieved because he asked him the third time,
{
  Do you have affection for me?
}

He said to him,
{
  Lord, you know everything.
}

You know that I have affection for you.

Jesus said to him,
{
  Feed my sheep.

  # John 21:18
  Most certainly I tell you,
  when you were young,
  you dressed yourself and walked where you wanted to.

  But when you are old,
  you will stretch out your hands,
  and another will dress you and carry you where you don't want to go.
}

# John 21:19
Now he said this,
signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God.

When he had said this,
he said to him,
{
  Follow me.
}

# John 21:20
Then Peter,
turning around,
saw a disciple following.

This was the disciple whom Jesus loved,
the one who had also leaned on Jesus' breast at the supper and asked,
{
  Lord, who is going to betray you?
}

# John 21:21
Peter,
seeing him,
said to Jesus,
{
  Lord, what about this man?
}

# John 21:22
Jesus said to him,
{
  If I desire that he stay until I come,
  what is that to you?

  You follow me.
}

# John 21:23
This saying therefore went out among the brothers
that this disciple wouldn't die.

Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die,
but,
{
  If I desire that he stay until I come,
  what is that to you?
}

# John 21:24
This is the disciple who testifies about these things,
and wrote these things.

We know that his witness is true.

# John 21:25
There are also many other things which Jesus did,
which if they would all be written,
I suppose that even the world itself wouldn't have room
for the books that would be written.
