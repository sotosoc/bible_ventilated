  Since you are humbled,
  no lumberjack has come up against us.
}

# 1Isaiah 14:09
Sheol from beneath has moved for you to meet you at your coming.

It stirs up the departed spirits for you,
even all the rulers of the earth.

It has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.

# 1Isaiah 14:10
They all will answer and ask you,
{
  Have you also become as weak as we are?

  Have you become like us?
}

# 1Isaiah 14:11
Your pomp is brought down to Sheol,
with the sound of your stringed instruments.

Maggots are spread out under you,
and worms cover you.

# 1Isaiah 14:12
How you have fallen from heaven,
shining one,
son of the dawn!

How you are cut down to the ground,
who laid the nations low!

# 1Isaiah 14:13
You said in your heart,
{
  I will ascend into heaven!

  I will exalt my throne above the stars of God!

  I will sit on the mountain of assembly,
  in the far north!

  # 1Isaiah 14:14
  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds!

  I will make myself like the Most High!
}

# 1Isaiah 14:15
Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol,
to the depths of the pit.

# 1Isaiah 14:16
Those who see you will stare at you.

They will ponder you,
saying,
{
  Is this the man who made the earth to tremble,
  who shook kingdoms,
  # 1Isaiah 14:17
  who made the world like a wilderness,
  and overthrew its cities,
  who didn't release his prisoners to their home?
}

# 1Isaiah 14:18
All the kings of the nations sleep in glory,
everyone in his own house.

# 1Isaiah 14:19
But you are cast away from your tomb like an abominable branch,
clothed with the slain who are thrust through with the sword,
who go down to the stones of the pit;
like a dead body trodden under foot.

# 1Isaiah 14:20
You will not join them in burial,
because you have destroyed your land.

You have killed your people.

The offspring of evildoers will not be named forever.

# 1Isaiah 14:21
Prepare for slaughter of his children because of the iniquity of their fathers,
that they not rise up and possess the earth,
and fill the surface of the world with cities.

# 1Isaiah 14:22
{
  I will rise up against them,
}

says Yahweh of Armies,
{
  and cut off from Babylon name and remnant,
  and son and son's son,
}

says Yahweh.

# 1Isaiah 14:23
{
  I will also make it a possession for the porcupine,
  and pools of water.

  I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,
}

says Yahweh of Armies.

# 1Isaiah 14:24
Yahweh of Armies has sworn,
saying,
{
  Surely,
  as I have thought,
  so shall it happen;
  and as I have purposed,
  so shall it stand:

  # 1Isaiah 14:25
  that I will break the Assyrian in my land,
  and tread him under foot on my mountains.

  Then his yoke will leave them,
  and his burden leave their shoulders.

  # 1Isaiah 14:26
  This is the plan that is determined for the whole earth.

  This is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations.

  # 1Isaiah 14:27
  For Yahweh of Armies has planned,
  and who can stop it?

  His hand is stretched out,
  and who can turn it back?
}

# 1Isaiah 14:28
This burden was in the year that King Ahaz died.

# 1Isaiah 14:29
Don't rejoice, O Philistia,
all of you,
because the rod that struck you is broken;
for out of the serpent's root an adder will emerge,
and his fruit will be a fiery flying serpent.

# 1Isaiah 14:30
The firstborn of the poor will eat,
and the needy will lie down in safety;
and I will kill your root with famine,
and your remnant will be killed.

# 1Isaiah 14:31
Howl, gate!

Cry, city!

You are melted away, Philistia,
all of you;
for smoke comes out of the north,
and there is no straggler in his ranks.

# 1Isaiah 14:32
What will they answer the messengers of the nation?

That Yahweh has founded Zion,
and in her the afflicted of his people will take refuge.

# 1Isaiah 15:01
The burden of Moab.

For in a night,
Ar of Moab is laid waste,
and brought to nothing.

For in a night Kir of Moab is laid waste,
and brought to nothing.

# 1Isaiah 15:02
They have gone up to Bayith,
and to Dibon,
to the high places,
to weep.

Moab wails over Nebo and over Medeba.

Baldness is on all of their heads.

Every beard is cut off.

# 1Isaiah 15:03
In their streets,
they clothe themselves in sackcloth.

In their streets and on their housetops,
everyone wails,
weeping abundantly.

# 1Isaiah 15:04
Heshbon cries out with Elealeh.

Their voice is heard even to Jahaz.

Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud.

Their souls tremble within them.

# 1Isaiah 15:05
My heart cries out for Moab!

Her nobles flee to Zoar,
to Eglath Shelishiyah;
for they go up by the ascent of Luhith with weeping;
for on the way to Horonaim,
they raise up a cry of destruction.

# 1Isaiah 15:06
For the waters of Nimrim will be desolate;
for the grass has withered away,
the tender grass fails,
there is no green thing.

# 1Isaiah 15:07
Therefore they will carry away the abundance they have gotten,
and that which they have stored up,
over the brook of the willows.

# 1Isaiah 15:08
For the cry has gone around the borders of Moab,
its wailing to Eglaim,
and its wailing to Beer Elim.

# 1Isaiah 15:09
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood;
for I will bring yet more on Dimon,
a lion on those of Moab who escape,
and on the remnant of the land.

# 1Isaiah 16:01
Send the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness,
to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.

# 1Isaiah 16:02
For it will be that as wandering birds,
as a scattered nest,
so will the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.

# 1Isaiah 16:03
Give counsel!

Execute justice!

Make your shade like the night in the middle of the noonday!

Hide the outcasts!

Don't betray the fugitive!

# 1Isaiah 16:04
Let my outcasts dwell with you!

As for Moab,
be a hiding place for him from the face of the destroyer.

For the extortionist is brought to nothing.

Destruction ceases.

The oppressors are consumed out of the land.

# 1Isaiah 16:05
A throne will be established in loving kindness.

One will sit on it in truth,
in the tent of David,
judging,
seeking justice,
and swift to do righteousness.

# 1Isaiah 16:06
We have heard of the pride of Moab,
that he is very proud;
even of his arrogance,
his pride,
and his wrath.

His boastings are nothing.

# 1Isaiah 16:07
Therefore Moab will wail for Moab.

Everyone will wail.

You will mourn for the raisin cakes of Kir Hareseth,
utterly stricken.

# 1Isaiah 16:08
For the fields of Heshbon languish with the vine of Sibmah.

The lords of the nations have broken down its choice branches,
which reached even to Jazer,
which wandered into the wilderness.

Its shoots were spread abroad.

They passed over the sea.

# 1Isaiah 16:09
Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah.

I will water you with my tears,
Heshbon,
and Elealeh:
for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the battle shout has fallen.

# 1Isaiah 16:10
Gladness is taken away,
and joy out of the fruitful field;
and in the vineyards there will be no singing,
neither joyful noise.

Nobody will tread out wine in the presses.

I have made the shouting stop.

# 1Isaiah 16:11
Therefore my heart sounds like a harp for Moab,
and my inward parts for Kir Heres.

# 1Isaiah 16:12
It will happen that when Moab presents himself,
when he wearies himself on the high place,
and comes to his sanctuary to pray,
that he will not prevail.

# 1Isaiah 16:13
This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past.

# 1Isaiah 16:14
But now Yahweh has spoken,
saying,
{
  Within three years,
  as a worker bound by contract would count them,
  the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt,
  with all his great multitude;
  and the remnant will be very small and feeble.
}

# 1Isaiah 17:01
The burden of Damascus.

{
  Behold,
  Damascus is taken away from being a city,
  and it will be a ruinous heap.

  # 1Isaiah 17:02
  The cities of Aroer are forsaken.

  They will be for flocks,
  which shall lie down,
  and no one shall make them afraid.

  # 1Isaiah 17:03
  The fortress shall cease from Ephraim,
  and the kingdom from Damascus,
  and the remnant of Syria.

  They will be as the glory of the children of Israel,
}

says Yahweh of Armies.

# 1Isaiah 17:04
{
  It will happen in that day that the glory of Jacob will be made thin,
  and the fatness of his flesh will become lean.

  # 1Isaiah 17:05
  It will be like when the harvester gathers the wheat,
  and his arm reaps the grain.

  Yes,
  it will be like when one gleans grain in the valley of Rephaim.

  # 1Isaiah 17:06
  Yet gleanings will be left there,
  like the shaking of an olive tree,
  two or three olives in the top of the uppermost bough,
  four or five in the outermost branches of a fruitful tree,
}

says Yahweh,
the God of Israel.

# 1Isaiah 17:07
In that day,
people will look to their Maker,
and their eyes will have respect for the Holy One of Israel.

# 1Isaiah 17:08
They will not look to the altars,
the work of their hands;
neither shall they respect that which their fingers have made,
either the Asherah poles or the incense altars.

# 1Isaiah 17:09
In that day,
their strong cities will be like the forsaken places in the woods and on the mountain top,
which were forsaken from before the children of Israel;
and it will be a desolation.

# 1Isaiah 17:10
For you have forgotten the God of your salvation,
and have not remembered the rock of your strength.

Therefore you plant pleasant plants,
and set out foreign seedlings.

# 1Isaiah 17:11
In the day of your planting,
you hedge it in.

In the morning,
you make your seed blossom,
but the harvest flees away in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

# 1Isaiah 17:12
Ah,
the uproar of many peoples who roar like the roaring of the seas;
and the rushing of nations that rush like the rushing of mighty waters!

# 1Isaiah 17:13
The nations will rush like the rushing of many waters,
but he will rebuke them,
and they will flee far off,
and will be chased like the chaff of the mountains before the wind,
and like the whirling dust before the storm.

# 1Isaiah 17:14
At evening,
behold,
terror!

Before the morning,
they are no more.

This is the portion of those who plunder us,
and the lot of those who rob us.

# 1Isaiah 18:01
Ah,
the land of the rustling of wings,
which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;

# 1Isaiah 18:02
that sends ambassadors by the sea,
even in vessels of papyrus on the waters,
saying,
{
  Go,
  you swift messengers,
  to a nation tall and smooth,
  to a people awesome from their beginning onward,
  a nation that measures out and treads down,
  whose land the rivers divide!
}

# 1Isaiah 18:03
All you inhabitants of the world,
and you dwellers on the earth,
when a banner is lifted up on the mountains,
look!

When the trumpet is blown, listen!

# 1Isaiah 18:04
For Yahweh said to me,
{
  I will be still,
  and I will see in my dwelling place,
  like clear heat in sunshine,
  like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
}

# 1Isaiah 18:05
For before the harvest,
when the blossom is over,
and the flower becomes a ripening grape,
he will cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks,
and he will cut down and take away the spreading branches.

# 1Isaiah 18:06
They will be left together for the ravenous birds of the mountains,
and for the animals of the earth.

The ravenous birds will eat them in the summer,
and all the animals of the earth will eat them in the winter.

# 1Isaiah 18:07
In that time,
a present will be brought to Yahweh of Armies from a people tall and smooth,
even from a people awesome from their beginning onward,
a nation that measures out and treads down,
whose land the rivers divide,
to the place of the name of Yahweh of Armies,
Mount Zion.

# 1Isaiah 19:01
The burden of Egypt.

{
  Behold,
  Yahweh rides on a swift cloud,
  and comes to Egypt.

  The idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence;
  and the heart of Egypt will melt within it.

  # 1Isaiah 19:02
  I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians,
  and they will fight everyone against his brother,
  and everyone against his neighbor;
  city against city,
  and kingdom against kingdom.

  # 1Isaiah 19:03
  The spirit of the Egyptians will fail within them.

  I will destroy their counsel.

  They will seek the idols,
  the charmers,
  those who have familiar spirits,
  and the wizards.

  # 1Isaiah 19:04
  I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord.

  A fierce king will rule over them,
}

says the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies.

# 1Isaiah 19:05
The waters will fail from the sea,
and the river will be wasted and become dry.

# 1Isaiah 19:06
The rivers will become foul.

The streams of Egypt will be diminished and dried up.

The reeds and flags will wither away.

# 1Isaiah 19:07
The meadows by the Nile,
by the brink of the Nile,
and all the sown fields of the Nile,
will become dry,
be driven away,
and be no more.

# 1Isaiah 19:08
The fishermen will lament,
and all those who fish in the Nile will mourn,
and those who spread nets on the waters will languish.

# 1Isaiah 19:09
Moreover those who work in combed flax,
and those who weave white cloth,
will be confounded.

# 1Isaiah 19:10
The pillars will be broken in pieces.

All those who work for hire will be grieved in soul.

# 1Isaiah 19:11
The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish.

The counsel of the wisest counselors of Pharaoh has become stupid.

How do you say to Pharaoh,
{
  I am the son of the wise,
  the son of ancient kings?
}

# 1Isaiah 19:12
Where then are your wise men?

Let them tell you now;
and let them know what Yahweh of Armies has purposed concerning Egypt.

# 1Isaiah 19:13
The princes of Zoan have become fools.

The princes of Memphis are deceived.

They have caused Egypt to go astray,
those who are the cornerstone of her tribes.

# 1Isaiah 19:14
Yahweh has mixed a spirit of perverseness in the middle of her;
and they have caused Egypt to go astray in all of its works,
like a drunken man staggers in his vomit.

# 1Isaiah 19:15
Neither shall there be any work for Egypt,
which head or tail,
palm branch or rush,
may do.

# 1Isaiah 19:16
In that day the Egyptians will be like women.

They will tremble and fear because of the shaking of Yahweh of Armies's hand,
which he shakes over them.

# 1Isaiah 19:17
The land of Judah will become a terror to Egypt.

Everyone to whom mention is made of it will be afraid,
because of the plans of Yahweh of Armies,
which he determines against it.

# 1Isaiah 19:18
In that day,
there will be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan,
and swear to Yahweh of Armies.

One will be called ``The city of destruction.''

# 1Isaiah 19:19
In that day,
there will be an altar to Yahweh in the middle of the land of Egypt,
and a pillar to Yahweh at its border.

# 1Isaiah 19:20
It will be for a sign and for a witness to Yahweh of Armies in the land of Egypt;
for they will cry to Yahweh because of oppressors,
and he will send them a savior and a defender,
and he will deliver them.

# 1Isaiah 19:21
Yahweh will be known to Egypt,
and the Egyptians will know Yahweh in that day.

Yes,
they will worship with sacrifice and offering,
and will vow a vow to Yahweh,
and will perform it.

# 1Isaiah 19:22
Yahweh will strike Egypt,
striking and healing.

They will return to Yahweh,
and he will be entreated by them,
and will heal them.

# 1Isaiah 19:23
In that day there will be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt,
and the Egyptian into Assyria;
and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.

# 1Isaiah 19:24
In that day,
Israel will be the third with Egypt and with Assyria,
a blessing within the earth;
# 1Isaiah 19:25
because Yahweh of Armies has blessed them,
saying,
{
  Blessed be Egypt my people,
  Assyria the work of my hands,
  and Israel my inheritance.
}

# 1Isaiah 20:01
In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod,
when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,
and he fought against Ashdod and took it;
# 1Isaiah 20:02
at that time Yahweh spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
saying,
{
  Go,
  and loosen the sackcloth from off your waist,
  and take your sandals from off your feet.
}

He did so,
walking naked and barefoot.

# 1Isaiah 20:03
Yahweh said,
{
  As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and a wonder concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia,
  # 1Isaiah 20:04
  so the king of Assyria will lead away the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Ethiopia,
  young and old,
  naked and barefoot,
  and with buttocks uncovered,
  to the shame of Egypt.

  # 1Isaiah 20:05
  They will be dismayed and confounded,
  because of Ethiopia their expectation,
  and of Egypt their glory.

  # 1Isaiah 20:06
  The inhabitants of this coast land will say in that day,
  {
    Behold,
    this is our expectation,
    where we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria.

    And we,
    how will we escape?
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 21:01
The burden of the wilderness of the sea.

As whirlwinds in the South sweep through,
it comes from the wilderness,
from an awesome land.

# 1Isaiah 21:02
A grievous vision is declared to me.

The treacherous man deals treacherously,
and the destroyer destroys.

Go up, Elam; attack!

I have stopped all of Media's sighing.

# 1Isaiah 21:03
Therefore my thighs are filled with anguish.

Pains have seized me,
like the pains of a woman in labor.

I am in so much pain that I can't hear.

I am so dismayed that I can't see.

# 1Isaiah 21:04
My heart flutters.

Horror has frightened me.

The twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling for me.

# 1Isaiah 21:05
They prepare the table.

They set the watch.

They eat.

They drink.

Rise up,
you princes,
oil the shield!

# 1Isaiah 21:06
For the Lord said to me,
{
  Go, set a watchman.

  Let him declare what he sees.

  # 1Isaiah 21:07
  When he sees a troop,
  horsemen in pairs,
  a troop of donkeys,
  a troop of camels,
  he shall listen diligently with great attentiveness.
}

# 1Isaiah 21:08
He cried like a lion:
{
  Lord,
  I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime,
  and every night I stay at my post.

  # 1Isaiah 21:09
  Behold,
  here comes a troop of men,
  horsemen in pairs.
}

He answered,
{
  Fallen,
  fallen is Babylon;
  and all the engraved images of her gods are broken to the ground.

  # 1Isaiah 21:10
  You are my threshing,
  and the grain of my floor!
}

That which I have heard from Yahweh of Armies,
the God of Israel,
I have declared to you.

# 1Isaiah 21:11
The burden of Dumah.

One calls to me out of Seir,
{
  Watchman,
  what of the night?

  Watchman,
  what of the night?
}

# 1Isaiah 21:12
The watchman said,
{
  The morning comes,
  and also the night.

  If you will inquire,
  inquire.

  Come back again.
}

# 1Isaiah 21:13
The burden on Arabia.

You will lodge in the thickets in Arabia,
you caravans of Dedanites.

# 1Isaiah 21:14
They brought water to him who was thirsty.

The inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.

# 1Isaiah 21:15
For they fled away from the swords,
from the drawn sword,
from the bent bow,
and from the heat of battle.

# 1Isaiah 21:16
For the Lord said to me,
{
  Within a year,
  as a worker bound by contract would count it,
  all the glory of Kedar will fail,

  # 1Isaiah 21:17
  and the residue of the number of the archers,
  the mighty men of the children of Kedar,
  will be few;
  for Yahweh,
  the God of Israel,
  has spoken it.
}

# 1Isaiah 22:01
The burden of the valley of vision.

What ails you now,
that you have all gone up to the housetops?

# 1Isaiah 22:02
You that are full of shouting,
a tumultuous city,
a joyous town,
your slain are not slain with the sword,
neither are they dead in battle.

# 1Isaiah 22:03
All your rulers fled away together.

They were bound by the archers.

All who were found by you were bound together.

They fled far away.

# 1Isaiah 22:04
Therefore I said,
{
  Look away from me.

  I will weep bitterly.

  Don't labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.

  # 1Isaiah 22:05
  For it is a day of confusion,
  and of treading down,
  and of perplexity from the Lord,
  Yahweh of Armies,
  in the valley of vision,
  a breaking down of the walls,
  and a crying to the mountains.
}

# 1Isaiah 22:06
Elam carried his quiver,
with chariots of men and horsemen;
and Kir uncovered the shield.

# 1Isaiah 22:07
Your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.

# 1Isaiah 22:08
He took away the covering of Judah;
and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.

# 1Isaiah 22:09
You saw the breaches of David's city,
that they were many;
and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool.

# 1Isaiah 22:10
You counted the houses of Jerusalem,
and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.

# 1Isaiah 22:11
You also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool.

But you didn't look to him who had done this,
neither did you have respect for him who planned it long ago.

# 1Isaiah 22:12
In that day,
the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies,
called to weeping,
to mourning,
to baldness,
and to dressing in sackcloth;

# 1Isaiah 22:13
and behold,
there is joy and gladness,
killing cattle and killing sheep,
eating meat and drinking wine:
{
  Let's eat and drink,
  for tomorrow we will die.
}

# 1Isaiah 22:14
Yahweh of Armies revealed himself in my ears,
{
  Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you until you die,
}

says the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies.

# 1Isaiah 22:15
The Lord,
Yahweh of Armies says,
{
  Go,
  get yourself to this treasurer,
  even to Shebna,
  who is over the house,
  and say,

  # 1Isaiah 22:16
  {
    What are you doing here?

    Who has you here,
    that you have dug out a tomb here?
  }

  Cutting himself out a tomb on high,
  chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!
}

# 1Isaiah 22:17
Behold,
Yahweh will overcome you and hurl you away violently.

Yes,
he will grasp you firmly.

# 1Isaiah 22:18
He will surely wind you around and around,
and throw you like a ball into a large country.

There you will die,
and there the chariots of your glory will be,
you disgrace of your lord's house.

# 1Isaiah 22:19
I will thrust you from your office.

You will be pulled down from your station.

# 1Isaiah 22:20
It will happen in that day that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,

# 1Isaiah 22:21
and I will clothe him with your robe,
and strengthen him with your belt.

I will commit your government into his hand;
and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
and to the house of Judah.

# 1Isaiah 22:22
I will lay the key of David's house on his shoulder.

He will open,
and no one will shut.

He will shut,
and no one will open.

# 1Isaiah 22:23
I will fasten him like a nail in a sure place.

He will be for a throne of glory to his father's house.

# 1Isaiah 22:24
They will hang on him all the glory of his father's house,
the offspring and the issue,
every small vessel,
from the cups even to all the pitchers.

# 1Isaiah 22:25
{
  In that day,
}

says Yahweh of Armies,
{
  the nail that was fastened in a sure place will give way.

  It will be cut down and fall.

  The burden that was on it will be cut off,
  for Yahweh has spoken it.
}

# 1Isaiah 23:01
The burden of Tyre.

Howl,
you ships of Tarshish!

For it is laid waste,
so that there is no house,
no entering in.

From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.

# 1Isaiah 23:02
Be still,
you inhabitants of the coast,
you whom the merchants of Sidon that pass over the sea have replenished.

# 1Isaiah 23:03
On great waters,
the seed of the Shihor,
the harvest of the Nile,
was her revenue.

She was the market of nations.

# 1Isaiah 23:04
Be ashamed,
Sidon;
for the sea has spoken,
the stronghold of the sea,
saying,
{
  I have not travailed,
  nor given birth,
  neither have I nourished young men,
  nor brought up virgins.
}

# 1Isaiah 23:05
When the report comes to Egypt,
they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.

# 1Isaiah 23:06
Pass over to Tarshish!

Wail,
you inhabitants of the coast!

# 1Isaiah 23:07
Is this your joyous city,
whose antiquity is of ancient days,
whose feet carried her far away to travel?

# 1Isaiah 23:08
Who has planned this against Tyre,
the giver of crowns,
whose merchants are princes,
whose traders are the honorable of the earth?

# 1Isaiah 23:09
Yahweh of Armies has planned it,
to stain the pride of all glory,
to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.

# 1Isaiah 23:10
Pass through your land like the Nile,
daughter of Tarshish.

There is no restraint any more.

# 1Isaiah 23:11
He has stretched out his hand over the sea.

He has shaken the kingdoms.

Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan's strongholds.

# 1Isaiah 23:12
He said,
{
  You shall rejoice no more,
  you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon.

  Arise,
  pass over to Kittim.

  Even there you will have no rest.
}

# 1Isaiah 23:13
Behold,
the land of the Chaldeans.

This people didn't exist.

The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness.

They set up their towers.

They overthrew its palaces.

They made it a ruin.

# 1Isaiah 23:14
Howl,
you ships of Tarshish,
for your stronghold is laid waste!

# 1Isaiah 23:15
It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years,
according to the days of one king.

After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute.

# 1Isaiah 23:16
Take a harp;
go about the city,
you prostitute that has been forgotten.

Make sweet melody.

Sing many songs,
that you may be remembered.

# 1Isaiah 23:17
It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre.

She will return to her wages,
and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth.

# 1Isaiah 23:18
Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh.

It will not be treasured nor laid up;
for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before Yahweh,
to eat sufficiently,
and for durable clothing.

# 1Isaiah 24:01
Behold,
Yahweh makes the earth empty,
makes it waste,
turns it upside down,
and scatters its inhabitants.

# 1Isaiah 24:02
It will be as with the people,
so with the priest;
as with the servant,
so with his master;
as with the maid,
so with her mistress;
as with the buyer,
so with the seller;
as with the creditor,
so with the debtor;
as with the taker of interest,
so with the giver of interest.

# 1Isaiah 24:03
The earth will be utterly emptied and utterly laid waste;
for Yahweh has spoken this word.

# 1Isaiah 24:04
The earth mourns and fades away.

The world languishes and fades away.

The lofty people of the earth languish.

# 1Isaiah 24:05
The earth also is polluted under its inhabitants,
because they have transgressed the laws,
violated the statutes,
and broken the everlasting covenant.

# 1Isaiah 24:06
Therefore the curse has devoured the earth,
and those who dwell therein are found guilty.

Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned,
and few men are left.

# 1Isaiah 24:07
The new wine mourns.

The vine languishes.

All the merry-hearted sigh.

# 1Isaiah 24:08
The mirth of tambourines ceases.

The sound of those who rejoice ends.

The joy of the harp ceases.

# 1Isaiah 24:09
They will not drink wine with a song.

Strong drink will be bitter to those who drink it.

# 1Isaiah 24:10
The confused city is broken down.

Every house is shut up,
that no man may come in.

# 1Isaiah 24:11
There is a crying in the streets because of the wine.

All joy is darkened.

The mirth of the land is gone.

# 1Isaiah 24:12
The city is left in desolation,
and the gate is struck with destruction.

# 1Isaiah 24:13
For it will be so within the earth among the peoples,
as the shaking of an olive tree,
as the gleanings when the vintage is done.

# 1Isaiah 24:14
These shall lift up their voice.

They will shout for the majesty of Yahweh.

They cry aloud from the sea.

# 1Isaiah 24:15
Therefore glorify Yahweh in the east,
even the name of Yahweh,
the God of Israel,
in the islands of the sea!

# 1Isaiah 24:16
From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs.

Glory to the righteous!

But I said,
{
  I pine away!

  I pine away!

  woe is me!
}

The treacherous have dealt treacherously.

Yes,
the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.

# 1Isaiah 24:17
Fear,
the pit,
and the snare are on you who inhabit the earth.

# 1Isaiah 24:18
It will happen that he who flees from the noise of the fear will fall into the pit;
and he who comes up out of the middle of the pit will be taken in the snare;
for the windows on high are opened,
and the foundations of the earth tremble.

# 1Isaiah 24:19
The earth is utterly broken.

The earth is torn apart.

The earth is shaken violently.

# 1Isaiah 24:20
The earth will stagger like a drunken man,
and will sway back and forth like a hammock.

Its disobedience will be heavy on it,
and it will fall and not rise again.

# 1Isaiah 24:21
It will happen in that day that Yahweh will punish the army of the high ones on high,
and the kings of the earth on the earth.

# 1Isaiah 24:22
They will be gathered together,
as prisoners are gathered in the pit,
and will be shut up in the prison;
and after many days they will be visited.

# 1Isaiah 24:23
Then the moon will be confounded,
and the sun ashamed;
for Yahweh of Armies will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem;
and glory will be before his elders.

# 1Isaiah 25:01
Yahweh,
you are my God.

I will exalt you!

I will praise your name,
for you have done wonderful things,
things planned long ago,
in complete faithfulness and truth.

# 1Isaiah 25:02
For you have made a city into a heap,
a fortified city into a ruin,
a palace of strangers to be no city.

It will never be built.

# 1Isaiah 25:03
Therefore a strong people will glorify you.

A city of awesome nations will fear you.

# 1Isaiah 25:04
For you have been a stronghold to the poor,
a stronghold to the needy in his distress,
a refuge from the storm,
a shade from the heat,
when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall.

# 1Isaiah 25:05
As the heat in a dry place you will bring down the noise of strangers;
as the heat by the shade of a cloud,
the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low.

# 1Isaiah 25:06
In this mountain,
Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of choice meat,
a feast of choice wines,
of choice meat full of marrow,
of well refined choice wines.

# 1Isaiah 25:07
He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples,
and the veil that is spread over all nations.

# 1Isaiah 25:08
He has swallowed up death forever!

The Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears from off all faces.

He will take the reproach of his people away from off all the earth,
for Yahweh has spoken it.

# 1Isaiah 25:09
It shall be said in that day,
{
  Behold,
  this is our God!

  We have waited for him,
  and he will save us!

  This is Yahweh!

  We have waited for him.

  We will be glad and rejoice in his salvation!
}

# 1Isaiah 25:10
For Yahweh's hand will rest in this mountain.

Moab will be trodden down in his place,
even like straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.

# 1Isaiah 25:11
He will spread out his hands in the middle of it,
like one who swims spreads out hands to swim,
but his pride will be humbled together with the craft of his hands.

# 1Isaiah 25:12
He has brought the high fortress of your walls down,
laid low,
and brought to the ground,
even to the dust.

# 1Isaiah 26:01
In that day,
this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
{
  We have a strong city.

  God appoints salvation for walls and bulwarks.

  # 1Isaiah 26:02
  Open the gates,
  that the righteous nation may enter:
  the one which keeps faith.

  # 1Isaiah 26:03
  You will keep whoever's mind is steadfast in perfect peace,
  because he trusts in you.

  # 1Isaiah 26:04
  Trust in Yahweh forever;
  for in Yah, Yahweh,
  is an everlasting Rock.

  # 1Isaiah 26:05
  For he has brought down those who dwell on high,
  the lofty city.

  He lays it low.

  He lays it low even to the ground.

  He brings it even to the dust.

  # 1Isaiah 26:06
  The foot shall tread it down,
  even the feet of the poor and the steps of the needy.
}

# 1Isaiah 26:07
The way of the just is uprightness.

You who are upright make the path of the righteous level.

# 1Isaiah 26:08
Yes,
in the way of your judgments,
Yahweh,
we have waited for you.

Your name and your renown are the desire of our soul.

# 1Isaiah 26:09
With my soul I have desired you in the night.

Yes,
with my spirit within me I will seek you earnestly;
for when your judgments are in the earth,
the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

# 1Isaiah 26:10
Let favor be shown to the wicked,
yet he will not learn righteousness.

In the land of uprightness he will deal wrongfully,
and will not see Yahweh's majesty.

# 1Isaiah 26:11
Yahweh,
your hand is lifted up,
yet they don't see;
but they will see your zeal for the people and be disappointed.

Yes,
fire will consume your adversaries.

# 1Isaiah 26:12
Yahweh,
you will ordain peace for us,
for you have also done all our work for us.

# 1Isaiah 26:13
Yahweh our God,
other lords besides you have had dominion over us,
but we will only acknowledge your name.

# 1Isaiah 26:14
The dead shall not live.

The departed spirits shall not rise.

Therefore you have visited and destroyed them,
and caused all memory of them to perish.

# 1Isaiah 26:15
You have increased the nation,
O Yahweh.

You have increased the nation!

You are glorified!

You have enlarged all the borders of the land.

# 1Isaiah 26:16
Yahweh,
in trouble they have visited you.

They poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.

# 1Isaiah 26:17
Just as a woman with child,
who draws near the time of her delivery,
is in pain and cries out in her pangs,
so we have been before you,
Yahweh.

# 1Isaiah 26:18
We have been with child.

We have been in pain.

We gave birth,
it seems,
only to wind.

We have not worked any deliverance in the earth;
neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.

# 1Isaiah 26:19
Your dead shall live.

Their dead bodies shall arise.

Awake and sing,
you who dwell in the dust;
for your dew is like the dew of herbs,
and the earth will cast out the departed spirits.

# 1Isaiah 26:20
Come,
my people,
enter into your rooms,
and shut your doors behind you.

Hide yourself for a little moment,
until the indignation is past.

# 1Isaiah 26:21
For,
behold,
Yahweh comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.

The earth also will disclose her blood,
and will no longer cover her slain.

# 1Isaiah 27:01
In that day,
Yahweh with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan,
the fleeing serpent,
and leviathan,
the twisted serpent;
and he will kill the dragon that is in the sea.

# 1Isaiah 27:02
In that day,
sing to her,
{
  A pleasant vineyard!

  # 1Isaiah 27:03
  I, Yahweh,
  am its keeper.

  I will water it every moment.

  Lest anyone damage it,
  I will keep it night and day.

  # 1Isaiah 27:04
  Wrath is not in me,
  but if I should find briers and thorns,
  I would do battle!

  I would march on them and I would burn them together.

  # 1Isaiah 27:05
  Or else let him take hold of my strength,
  that he may make peace with me.

  Let him make peace with me.
}

# 1Isaiah 27:06
In days to come,
Jacob will take root.

Israel will blossom and bud.

They will fill the surface of the world with fruit.

# 1Isaiah 27:07
Has he struck them as he struck those who struck them?

Or are they killed like those who killed them were killed?

# 1Isaiah 27:08
In measure,
when you send them away,
you contend with them.

He has removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.

# 1Isaiah 27:09
Therefore by this the iniquity of Jacob will be forgiven,
and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin:
that he makes all the stones of the altar as chalk stones that are beaten in pieces,
so that the Asherah poles and the incense altars shall rise no more.

# 1Isaiah 27:10
For the fortified city is solitary,
a habitation deserted and forsaken,
like the wilderness.

The calf will feed there,
and there he will lie down,
and consume its branches.

# 1Isaiah 27:11
When its boughs are withered,
they will be broken off.

The women will come and set them on fire,
for they are a people of no understanding.

Therefore he who made them will not have compassion on them,
and he who formed them will show them no favor.

# 1Isaiah 27:12
It will happen in that day that Yahweh will thresh from the flowing stream of the Euphrates to the brook of Egypt;
and you will be gathered one by one,
children of Israel.

# 1Isaiah 27:13
It will happen in that day that a great trumpet will be blown;
and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria,
and those who were outcasts in the land of Egypt,
shall come;
and they will worship Yahweh in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.

# 1Isaiah 28:01
Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim,
and to the fading flower of his glorious beauty,
which is on the head of the fertile valley of those who are overcome with wine!

# 1Isaiah 28:02
Behold,
the Lord has one who is mighty and strong.

Like a storm of hail,
a destroying storm,
and like a storm of mighty waters overflowing,
he will cast them down to the earth with his hand.

# 1Isaiah 28:03
The crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden under foot.

# 1Isaiah 28:04
The fading flower of his glorious beauty,
which is on the head of the fertile valley,
shall be like the first-ripe fig before the summer,
which someone picks and eats as soon as he sees it.

# 1Isaiah 28:05
In that day,
Yahweh of Armies will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the residue of his people,

# 1Isaiah 28:06
and a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment,
and strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate.

# 1Isaiah 28:07
They also reel with wine,
and stagger with strong drink.

The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink.

They are swallowed up by wine.

They stagger with strong drink.

They err in vision.

They stumble in judgment.

# 1Isaiah 28:08
For all tables are completely full of filthy vomit and filthiness.

# 1Isaiah 28:09
Whom will he teach knowledge?

To whom will he explain the message?

Those who are weaned from the milk,
and drawn from the breasts?

# 1Isaiah 28:10
For it is precept on precept,
precept on precept;
line on line,
line on line;
here a little,
there a little.

# 1Isaiah 28:11
But he will speak to this nation with stammering lips and in another language,

# 1Isaiah 28:12
to whom he said,
{
  This is the resting place.

  Give rest to the weary,
}

and
{
  This is the refreshing;
}

yet they would not hear.

# 1Isaiah 28:13
Therefore Yahweh's word will be to them precept on precept,
precept on precept;
line on line,
line on line;
here a little,
there a little;
that they may go,
fall backward,
be broken,
be snared,
and be taken.

# 1Isaiah 28:14
Therefore hear Yahweh's word,
you scoffers,
that rule this people in Jerusalem:

# 1Isaiah 28:15
{
  Because you have said,
  {
    We have made a covenant with death,
    and we are in agreement with Sheol.

    When the overflowing scourge passes through,
    it won't come to us;
    for we have made lies our refuge,
    and we have hidden ourselves under falsehood.
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 28:16
Therefore the Lord Yahweh says,
{
  Behold,
  I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone,
  a tried stone,
  a precious cornerstone of a sure foundation.

  He who believes shall not act hastily.

  # 1Isaiah 28:17
  I will make justice the measuring line,
  and righteousness the plumb line.

  The hail will sweep away the refuge of lies,
  and the waters will overflow the hiding place.

  # 1Isaiah 28:18
  Your covenant with death shall be annulled,
  and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand.

  When the overflowing scourge passes through,
  then you will be trampled down by it.

  # 1Isaiah 28:19
  As often as it passes through,
  it will seize you;
  for morning by morning it will pass through,
  by day and by night;
  and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.
}

# 1Isaiah 28:20
For the bed is too short to stretch out on,
and the blanket is too narrow to wrap oneself in.

# 1Isaiah 28:21
For Yahweh will rise up as on Mount Perazim.

He will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon;
that he may do his work,
his unusual work,
and bring to pass his act,
his extraordinary act.

# 1Isaiah 28:22
Now therefore don't be scoffers,
lest your bonds be made strong;
for I have heard a decree of destruction from the Lord,
Yahweh of Armies,
on the whole earth.

# 1Isaiah 28:23
Give ear,
and hear my voice!

Listen,
and hear my speech!

# 1Isaiah 28:24
Does he who plows to sow plow continually?

Does he keep turning the soil and breaking the clods?

# 1Isaiah 28:25
When he has leveled its surface,
doesn't he plant the dill,
and scatter the cumin seed,
and put in the wheat in rows,
the barley in the appointed place,
and the spelt in its place?

# 1Isaiah 28:26
For his God instructs him in right judgment and teaches him.

# 1Isaiah 28:27
For the dill isn't threshed with a sharp instrument,
neither is a cart wheel turned over the cumin;
but the dill is beaten out with a stick,
and the cumin with a rod.

# 1Isaiah 28:28
Bread flour must be ground;
so he will not always be threshing it.

Although he drives the wheel of his threshing cart over it,
his horses don't grind it.

# 1Isaiah 28:29
This also comes out from Yahweh of Armies,
who is wonderful in counsel,
and excellent in wisdom.

# 1Isaiah 29:01
Woe to Ariel!

Ariel,
the city where David encamped!

Add year to year;
let the feasts come around;

# 1Isaiah 29:02
then I will distress Ariel,
and there will be mourning and lamentation.

She shall be to me as an altar hearth.

# 1Isaiah 29:03
I will encamp against you all around you,
and will lay siege against you with posted troops.

I will raise siege works against you.

# 1Isaiah 29:04
You will be brought down,
and will speak out of the ground.

Your speech will mumble out of the dust.

Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit,
out of the ground,
and your speech will whisper out of the dust.

# 1Isaiah 29:05
But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust,
and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away.

Yes,
it will be in an instant,
suddenly.

# 1Isaiah 29:06
She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder,
with earthquake,
with great noise,
with whirlwind and storm,
and with the flame of a devouring fire.

# 1Isaiah 29:07
The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
even all who fight against her and her stronghold,
and who distress her,
will be like a dream,
a vision of the night.

# 1Isaiah 29:08
It will be like when a hungry man dreams,
and behold,
he eats;
but he awakes,
and his hunger isn't satisfied;
or like when a thirsty man dreams,
and behold,
he drinks;
but he awakes,
and behold,
he is faint,
and he is still thirsty.

The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that.

# 1Isaiah 29:09
Pause and wonder!

Blind yourselves and be blind!

They are drunken,
but not with wine;
they stagger,
but not with strong drink.

# 1Isaiah 29:10
For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep,
and has closed your eyes,
the prophets;
and he has covered your heads,
the seers.

# 1Isaiah 29:11
All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed,
which men deliver to one who is educated,
saying,
{
  Read this, please;
}

and he says,
{
  I can't, for it is sealed;
}

# 1Isaiah 29:12
and the book is delivered to one who is not educated,
saying,
{
  Read this, please;
}

and he says,
{
  I can't read.
}

# 1Isaiah 29:13
The Lord said,
{
  Because this people draws near with their mouth and honors me with their lips,
  but they have removed their heart far from me,
  and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught;
  # 1Isaiah 29:14
  therefore,
  behold,
  I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people,
  even a marvelous work and a wonder;
  and the wisdom of their wise men will perish,
  and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.
}

# 1Isaiah 29:15
Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh,
and whose deeds are in the dark,
and who say,
{
  Who sees us?
}

and
{
  Who knows us?
}

# 1Isaiah 29:16
You turn things upside down!

Should the potter be thought to be like clay,
that the thing made should say about him who made it,
{
  He didn't make me;
}

or the thing formed say of him who formed it,
{
  He has no understanding?
}

# 1Isaiah 29:17
Isn't it yet a very little while,
and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field,
and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?

# 1Isaiah 29:18
In that day,
the deaf will hear the words of the book,
and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness.

# 1Isaiah 29:19
The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh,
and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

# 1Isaiah 29:20
For the ruthless is brought to nothing,
and the scoffer ceases,
and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off ---
# 1Isaiah 29:21
who cause a person to be indicted by a word,
and lay a snare for one who reproves in the gate,
and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.

# 1Isaiah 29:22
Therefore Yahweh,
who redeemed Abraham,
says concerning the house of Jacob:
{
  Jacob shall no longer be ashamed,
  neither shall his face grow pale.

  # 1Isaiah 29:23
  But when he sees his children,
  the work of my hands,
  in the middle of him,
  they will sanctify my name.

  Yes,
  they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,
  and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.

  # 1Isaiah 29:24
  They also who err in spirit will come to understanding,
  and those who grumble will receive instruction.
}

# 1Isaiah 30:01
{
  Woe to the rebellious children
}

,
says Yahweh,
{
  who take counsel,
  but not from me;
  and who make an alliance,
  but not with my Spirit,
  that they may add sin to sin;
  # 1Isaiah 30:02
  who set out to go down into Egypt without asking for my advice,
  to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
  and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!

  # 1Isaiah 30:03
  Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will be your shame,
  and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

  # 1Isaiah 30:04
  For their princes are at Zoan,
  and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.

  # 1Isaiah 30:05
  They shall all be ashamed because of a people that can't profit them,
  that are not a help nor profit,
  but a shame,
  and also a reproach.
}

# 1Isaiah 30:06
The burden of the animals of the South.

Through the land of trouble and anguish,
of the lioness and the lion,
the viper and fiery flying serpent,
they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys,
and their treasures on the humps of camels,
to an unprofitable people.

# 1Isaiah 30:07
For Egypt helps in vain,
and to no purpose;
therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still.

# 1Isaiah 30:08
Now go,
write it before them on a tablet,
and inscribe it in a book,
that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.

# 1Isaiah 30:09
For it is a rebellious people,
lying children,
children who will not hear Yahweh's law;
# 1Isaiah 30:10
who tell the seers,
{
  Don't see!
}

and the prophets,
{
  Don't prophesy to us right things.

  Tell us pleasant things.

  Prophesy deceits.

  # 1Isaiah 30:11
  Get out of the way.

  Turn away from the path.

  Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.
}

# 1Isaiah 30:12
Therefore the Holy One of Israel says,
{
  Because you despise this word,
  and trust in oppression and perverseness,
  and rely on it,

  # 1Isaiah 30:13
  therefore this iniquity shall be to you like a breach ready to fall,
  swelling out in a high wall,
  whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.

  # 1Isaiah 30:14
  He will break it as a potter's vessel is broken,
  breaking it in pieces without sparing,
  so that there won't be found among the broken pieces a piece good enough to take fire from the hearth,
  or to dip up water out of the cistern.
}

# 1Isaiah 30:15
For thus said the Lord Yahweh,
the Holy One of Israel,
{
  You will be saved in returning and rest.

  Your strength will be in quietness and in confidence.
}

You refused,
# 1Isaiah 30:16
but you said,
{
  No,
  for we will flee on horses;
}

therefore you will flee;
and,
{
  We will ride on the swift;
}

therefore those who pursue you will be swift.

# 1Isaiah 30:17
One thousand will flee at the threat of one.

At the threat of five,
you will flee until you are left like a beacon on the top of a mountain,
and like a banner on a hill.

# 1Isaiah 30:18
Therefore Yahweh will wait,
that he may be gracious to you;
and therefore he will be exalted,
that he may have mercy on you,
for Yahweh is a God of justice.

Blessed are all those who wait for him.

# 1Isaiah 30:19
For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem.

You will weep no more.

He will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry.

When he hears you,
he will answer you.

# 1Isaiah 30:20
Though the Lord may give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction,
yet your teachers won't be hidden any more,
but your eyes will see your teachers;

# 1Isaiah 30:21
and when you turn to the right hand,
and when you turn to the left,
your ears will hear a voice behind you,
saying,
{
  This is the way.

  Walk in it.
}

# 1Isaiah 30:22
You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver,
and the plating of your molten images of gold.

You shall cast them away as an unclean thing.

You shall tell it,
{
  Go away!
}

# 1Isaiah 30:23
He will give the rain for your seed,
with which you will sow the ground;
and bread of the increase of the ground will be rich and plentiful.

In that day,
your livestock will feed in large pastures.

# 1Isaiah 30:24
The oxen likewise and the young donkeys that till the ground will eat savory feed,
which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.

# 1Isaiah 30:25
There will be brooks and streams of water on every lofty mountain and on every high hill in the day of the great slaughter,
when the towers fall.

# 1Isaiah 30:26
Moreover the light of the moon will be like the light of the sun,
and the light of the sun will be seven times brighter,
like the light of seven days,
in the day that Yahweh binds up the fracture of his people,
and heals the wound they were struck with.

# 1Isaiah 30:27
Behold,
Yahweh's name comes from far away,
burning with his anger,
and in thick rising smoke.

His lips are full of indignation.

His tongue is as a devouring fire.

# 1Isaiah 30:28
His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck,
to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction.

A bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws of the peoples.

# 1Isaiah 30:29
You will have a song,
as in the night when a holy feast is kept,
and gladness of heart,
as when one goes with a flute to come to Yahweh's mountain,
to Israel's Rock.

# 1Isaiah 30:30
Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard,
and will show the descent of his arm,
with the indignation of his anger and the flame of a devouring fire,
with a blast,
storm,
and hailstones.

# 1Isaiah 30:31
For through Yahweh's voice the Assyrian will be dismayed.

He will strike him with his rod.

# 1Isaiah 30:32
Every stroke of the rod of punishment,
which Yahweh will lay on him,
will be with the sound of tambourines and harps.

He will fight with them in battles,
brandishing weapons.

# 1Isaiah 30:33
For his burning place has long been ready.

Yes,
it is prepared for the king.

He has made its pyre deep and large with fire and much wood.

Yahweh's breath,
like a stream of sulfur,
kindles it.

# 1Isaiah 31:01
Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help,
and rely on horses,
and trust in chariots because they are many,
and in horsemen because they are very strong,
but they don't look to the Holy One of Israel,
and they don't seek Yahweh!

# 1Isaiah 31:02
Yet he also is wise,
and will bring disaster,
and will not call back his words,
but will arise against the house of the evildoers,
and against the help of those who work iniquity.

# 1Isaiah 31:03
Now the Egyptians are men,
and not God;
and their horses flesh,
and not spirit.

When Yahweh stretches out his hand,
both he who helps shall stumble,
and he who is helped shall fall,
and they all shall be consumed together.

# 1Isaiah 31:04
For Yahweh says to me,
{
  As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey,
  if a multitude of shepherds is called together against him,
  will not be dismayed at their voice,
  nor abase himself for their noise,
  so Yahweh of Armies will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its heights.

  # 1Isaiah 31:05
  As birds hovering,
  so Yahweh of Armies will protect Jerusalem.

  He will protect and deliver it.

  He will pass over and preserve it.
}

# 1Isaiah 31:06
Return to him from whom you have deeply revolted,
children of Israel.

# 1Isaiah 31:07
For in that day everyone shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold ---
sin which your own hands have made for you.

# 1Isaiah 31:08
{
  The Assyrian will fall by the sword,
  not of man;
  and the sword,
  not of mankind,
  shall devour him.

  He will flee from the sword,
  and his young men will become subject to forced labor.

  # 1Isaiah 31:09
  His rock will pass away by reason of terror,
  and his princes will be afraid of the banner,
}

says Yahweh,
whose fire is in Zion,
and his furnace in Jerusalem.

# 1Isaiah 32:01
Behold,
a king shall reign in righteousness,
and princes shall rule in justice.

# 1Isaiah 32:02
A man shall be as a hiding place from the wind,
and a covert from the storm,
as streams of water in a dry place,
as the shade of a large rock in a weary land.

# 1Isaiah 32:03
The eyes of those who see will not be dim,
and the ears of those who hear will listen.

# 1Isaiah 32:04
The heart of the rash will understand knowledge,
and the tongue of the stammerers will be ready to speak plainly.

# 1Isaiah 32:05
The fool will no longer be called noble,
nor the scoundrel be highly respected.

# 1Isaiah 32:06
For the fool will speak folly,
and his heart will work iniquity,
to practice profanity,
and to utter error against Yahweh,
to make empty the soul of the hungry,
and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

# 1Isaiah 32:07
The ways of the scoundrel are evil.

He devises wicked plans to destroy the humble with lying words,
even when the needy speaks right.

# 1Isaiah 32:08
But the noble devises noble things,
and he will continue in noble things.

# 1Isaiah 32:09
Rise up,
you women who are at ease!

Hear my voice!

You careless daughters,
give ear to my speech!

# 1Isaiah 32:10
For days beyond a year you will be troubled,
you careless women;
for the vintage will fail.

The harvest won't come.

# 1Isaiah 32:11
Tremble,
you women who are at ease!

Be troubled,
you careless ones!

Strip yourselves,
make yourselves naked,
and put sackcloth on your waist.

# 1Isaiah 32:12
Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields,
for the fruitful vine.

# 1Isaiah 32:13
Thorns and briers will come up on my people's land;
yes,
on all the houses of joy in the joyous city.

# 1Isaiah 32:14
For the palace will be forsaken.

The populous city will be deserted.

The hill and the watchtower will be for dens forever,
a delight for wild donkeys,
a pasture of flocks,

# 1Isaiah 32:15
until the Spirit is poured on us from on high,
and the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,
and the fruitful field is considered a forest.

# 1Isaiah 32:16
Then justice will dwell in the wilderness;
and righteousness will remain in the fruitful field.

# 1Isaiah 32:17
The work of righteousness will be peace,
and the effect of righteousness,
quietness and confidence forever.

# 1Isaiah 32:18
My people will live in a peaceful habitation,
in safe dwellings,
and in quiet resting places,

# 1Isaiah 32:19
though hail flattens the forest,
and the city is leveled completely.

# 1Isaiah 32:20
Blessed are you who sow beside all waters,
who send out the feet of the ox and the donkey.

# 1Isaiah 33:01
Woe to you who destroy,
but you weren't destroyed,
and who betray,
but nobody betrayed you!

When you have finished destroying,
you will be destroyed;
and when you have finished betrayal,
you will be betrayed.

# 1Isaiah 33:02
Yahweh,
be gracious to us.

We have waited for you.

Be our strength every morning,
our salvation also in the time of trouble.

# 1Isaiah 33:03
At the noise of the thunder,
the peoples have fled.

When you lift yourself up,
the nations are scattered.

# 1Isaiah 33:04
Your plunder will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers.

Men will leap on it as locusts leap.

# 1Isaiah 33:05
Yahweh is exalted,
for he dwells on high.

He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.

# 1Isaiah 33:06
There will be stability in your times,
abundance of salvation,
wisdom,
and knowledge.

The fear of Yahweh is your treasure.

# 1Isaiah 33:07
Behold,
their valiant ones cry outside;
the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.

# 1Isaiah 33:08
The highways are desolate.

The traveling man ceases.

The covenant is broken.

He has despised the cities.

He doesn't respect man.

# 1Isaiah 33:09
The land mourns and languishes.

Lebanon is confounded and withers away.

Sharon is like a desert,
and Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.

# 1Isaiah 33:10
{
  Now I will arise,
}

says Yahweh.

{
  Now I will lift myself up.

  Now I will be exalted.

  # 1Isaiah 33:11
  You will conceive chaff.

  You will give birth to stubble.

  Your breath is a fire that will devour you.

  # 1Isaiah 33:12
  The peoples will be like the burning of lime,
  like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire.

  # 1Isaiah 33:13
  Hear,
  you who are far off,
  what I have done;
  and,
  you who are near,
  acknowledge my might.
}

# 1Isaiah 33:14
The sinners in Zion are afraid.

Trembling has seized the godless ones.

Who among us can live with the devouring fire?

Who among us can live with everlasting burning?

# 1Isaiah 33:15
He who walks righteously and speaks blamelessly,
he who despises the gain of oppressions,
who gestures with his hands,
refusing to take a bribe,
who stops his ears from hearing of bloodshed,
and shuts his eyes from looking at evil ---

# 1Isaiah 33:16
he will dwell on high.

His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks.

His bread will be supplied.

His waters will be sure.

# 1Isaiah 33:17
Your eyes will see the king in his beauty.

They will see a distant land.

# 1Isaiah 33:18
Your heart will meditate on the terror.

Where is he who counted?

Where is he who weighed?

Where is he who counted the towers?

# 1Isaiah 33:19
You will no longer see the fierce people,
a people of a deep speech that you can't comprehend,
with a strange language that you can't understand.

# 1Isaiah 33:20
Look at Zion,
the city of our appointed festivals.

Your eyes will see Jerusalem,
a quiet habitation,
a tent that won't be removed.

Its stakes will never be plucked up,
nor will any of its cords be broken.

# 1Isaiah 33:21
But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty,
a place of wide rivers and streams,
in which no galley with oars will go,
neither will any gallant ship pass by there.

# 1Isaiah 33:22
For Yahweh is our judge.

Yahweh is our lawgiver.

Yahweh is our king.

He will save us.

# 1Isaiah 33:23
Your rigging is untied.

They couldn't strengthen the foot of their mast.

They couldn't spread the sail.

Then the prey of a great plunder was divided.

The lame took the prey.

# 1Isaiah 33:24
The inhabitant won't say,
{
  I am sick.
}

The people who dwell therein will be forgiven their iniquity.

# 1Isaiah 34:01
Come near,
you nations,
to hear!

Listen,
you peoples.

Let the earth and all it contains hear,
the world,
and everything that comes from it.

# 1Isaiah 34:02
For Yahweh is enraged against all the nations,
and angry with all their armies.

He has utterly destroyed them.

He has given them over for slaughter.

# 1Isaiah 34:03
Their slain will also be cast out,
and the stench of their dead bodies will come up.

The mountains will melt in their blood.

# 1Isaiah 34:04
All of the army of the sky will be dissolved.

The sky will be rolled up like a scroll,
and all its armies will fade away,
as a leaf fades from off a vine or a fig tree.

# 1Isaiah 34:05
For my sword has drunk its fill in the sky.

Behold,
it will come down on Edom,
and on the people of my curse,
for judgment.

# 1Isaiah 34:06
Yahweh's sword is filled with blood.

It is covered with fat,
with the blood of lambs and goats,
with the fat of the kidneys of rams;
for Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah,
and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

# 1Isaiah 34:07
The wild oxen will come down with them,
and the young bulls with the mighty bulls;
and their land will be drunken with blood,
and their dust made greasy with fat.

# 1Isaiah 34:08
For Yahweh has a day of vengeance,
a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.

# 1Isaiah 34:09
Its streams will be turned into pitch,
its dust into sulfur,
and its land will become burning pitch.

# 1Isaiah 34:10
It won't be quenched night or day.

Its smoke will go up forever.

From generation to generation,
it will lie waste.

No one will pass through it forever and ever.

# 1Isaiah 34:11
But the pelican and the porcupine will possess it.

The owl and the raven will dwell in it.

He will stretch the line of confusion over it,
and the plumb line of emptiness.

# 1Isaiah 34:12
They shall call its nobles to the kingdom,
but none shall be there;
and all its princes shall be nothing.

# 1Isaiah 34:13
Thorns will come up in its palaces,
nettles and thistles in its fortresses;
and it will be a habitation of jackals,
a court for ostriches.

# 1Isaiah 34:14
The wild animals of the desert will meet with the wolves,
and the wild goat will cry to his fellow.

Yes,
the night creature shall settle there,
and shall find herself a place of rest.

# 1Isaiah 34:15
The arrow snake will make her nest there,
and lay,
hatch,
and gather under her shade.

Yes,
the kites will be gathered there,
every one with her mate.

# 1Isaiah 34:16
Search in the book of Yahweh,
and read:
not one of these will be missing.

None will lack her mate.

For my mouth has commanded,
and his Spirit has gathered them.

# 1Isaiah 34:17
He has cast the lot for them,
and his hand has divided it to them with a measuring line.

They shall possess it forever.

From generation to generation they will dwell in it.

# 1Isaiah 35:01
The wilderness and the dry land will be glad.

The desert will rejoice and blossom like a rose.

# 1Isaiah 35:02
It will blossom abundantly,
and rejoice even with joy and singing.

Lebanon's glory will be given to it,
the excellence of Carmel and Sharon.

They will see Yahweh's glory,
the excellence of our God.

# 1Isaiah 35:03
Strengthen the weak hands,
and make the feeble knees firm.

# 1Isaiah 35:04
Tell those who have a fearful heart,
{
  Be strong!

  Don't be afraid!

  Behold,
  your God will come with vengeance,
  God's retribution.

  He will come and save you.

  # 1Isaiah 35:05
  Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,
  and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped.

  # 1Isaiah 35:06
  Then the lame man will leap like a deer,
  and the tongue of the mute will sing;
  for waters will break out in the wilderness,
  and streams in the desert.

  # 1Isaiah 35:07
  The burning sand will become a pool,
  and the thirsty ground springs of water.

  Grass with reeds and rushes will be in the habitation of jackals,
  where they lay.

  # 1Isaiah 35:08
  A highway will be there,
  a road,
  and it will be called ``The Holy Way''.

  The unclean shall not pass over it,
  but it will be for those who walk in the Way.

  Wicked fools shall not go there.

  # 1Isaiah 35:09
  No lion will be there,
  nor will any ravenous animal go up on it.

  They will not be found there;
  but the redeemed will walk there.

  # 1Isaiah 35:10
  Then Yahweh's ransomed ones will return,
  and come with singing to Zion;
  and everlasting joy will be on their heads.

  They will obtain gladness and joy,
  and sorrow and sighing will flee away.
}

# 1Isaiah 36:01
Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah,
Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all of the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.

# 1Isaiah 36:02
The king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army.

He stood by the aqueduct from the upper pool in the fuller's field highway.

# 1Isaiah 36:03
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
who was over the household,
and Shebna the scribe,
and Joah,
the son of Asaph the recorder came out to him.

# 1Isaiah 36:04
Rabshakeh said to them,
{
  Now tell Hezekiah,
  {
    The great king,
    the king of Assyria,
    says,
    {
      What confidence is this in which you trust?

      # 1Isaiah 36:05
      I say that your counsel and strength for the war are only vain words.

      Now in whom do you trust,
      that you have rebelled against me?

      # 1Isaiah 36:06
      Behold,
      you trust in the staff of this bruised reed,
      even in Egypt,
      which if a man leans on it,
      it will go into his hand and pierce it.

      So is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.

      # 1Isaiah 36:07
      But if you tell me,
      {
        We trust in Yahweh our God,
      }

      isn't that he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away,
      and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem,
      {
        You shall worship before this altar?
      }
    }

    # 1Isaiah 36:08
    Now therefore,
    please make a pledge to my master the king of Assyria,
    and I will give you two thousand horses,
    if you are able on your part to set riders on them.

    # 1Isaiah 36:09
    How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants,
    and put your trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?

    # 1Isaiah 36:10
    Have I come up now without Yahweh against this land to destroy it?

    Yahweh said to me,
    {
      Go up against this land,
      and destroy it.
    }
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 36:11
Then Eliakim,
Shebna and Joah said to Rabshakeh,
{
  Please speak to your servants in Aramaic,
  for we understand it.

  Don't speak to us in the Jews’ language in the hearing of the people who are on the wall.
}

# 1Isaiah 36:12
But Rabshakeh said,
{
  Has my master sent me only to your master and to you,
  to speak these words,
  and not to the men who sit on the wall,
  who will eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?
}

# 1Isaiah 36:13
Then Rabshakeh stood,
and called out with a loud voice in the Jews’ language,
and said,
{
  Hear the words of the great king,
  the king of Assyria!

  # 1Isaiah 36:14
  The king says,
  {
    Don't let Hezekiah deceive you;
    for he will not be able to deliver you.

    # 1Isaiah 36:15
    Don't let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh,
    saying,
    {
      Yahweh will surely deliver us.

      This city won't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
    }
  }

  # 1Isaiah 36:16
  Don't listen to Hezekiah,
  for the king of Assyria says,
  {
    Make your peace with me,
    and come out to me;
    and each of you eat from his vine,
    and each one from his fig tree,
    and each one of you drink the waters of his own cistern;
    # 1Isaiah 36:17
    until I come and take you away to a land like your own land,
    a land of grain and new wine,
    a land of bread and vineyards.

    # 1Isaiah 36:18
    Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you,
    saying,
    {
      Yahweh will deliver us.
    }

    Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their lands from the hand of the king of Assyria?

    # 1Isaiah 36:19
    Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?

    Where are the gods of Sepharvaim?

    Have they delivered Samaria from my hand?

    # 1Isaiah 36:20
    Who are they among all the gods of these countries that have delivered their country out of my hand,
    that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 36:21
But they remained silent,
and said nothing in reply,
for the king's commandment was,
{
  Don't answer him.
}

# 1Isaiah 36:22
Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
who was over the household,
and Shebna the scribe,
and Joah,
the son of Asaph the recorder,
came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn,
and told him the words of Rabshakeh.

# 1Isaiah 37:01
When King Hezekiah heard it,
he tore his clothes,
covered himself with sackcloth,
and went into Yahweh's house.

# 1Isaiah 37:02
He sent Eliakim,
who was over the household,
and Shebna the scribe,
and the elders of the priests,
covered with sackcloth,
to Isaiah the prophet,
the son of Amoz.

# 1Isaiah 37:03
They said to him,
{
  Hezekiah says,
  {
    Today is a day of trouble,
    and of rebuke,
    and of rejection;
    for the children have come to the birth,
    and there is no strength to give birth.

    # 1Isaiah 37:04
    It may be Yahweh your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
    whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God,
    and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard.

    Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left.
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 37:05
So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

# 1Isaiah 37:06
Isaiah said to them,
{
  Tell your master,
  {
    Yahweh says,
    {
      Don't be afraid of the words that you have heard,
      with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.

      # 1Isaiah 37:07
      Behold,
      I will put a spirit in him and he will hear news,
      and will return to his own land.

      I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
    }
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 37:08
So Rabshakeh returned,
and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah,
for he heard that he had departed from Lachish.

# 1Isaiah 37:09
He heard news concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia,
{
  He has come out to fight against you.
}

When he heard it,
he sent messengers to Hezekiah,
saying,
# 1Isaiah 37:10
{
  Thus you shall speak to Hezekiah king of Judah,
  saying,
  {
    Don't let your God in whom you trust deceive you,
    saying,
    {
      Jerusalem won't be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
    }

    # 1Isaiah 37:11
    Behold,
    you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands,
    by destroying them utterly.

    Shall you be delivered?

    # 1Isaiah 37:12
    Have the gods of the nations delivered them,
    which my fathers have destroyed,
    Gozan,
    Haran,
    Rezeph,
    and the children of Eden who were in Telassar?

    # 1Isaiah 37:13
    Where is the king of Hamath,
    and the king of Arpad,
    and the king of the city of Sepharvaim,
    of Hena,
    and Ivvah?
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 37:14
Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it.

Then Hezekiah went up to Yahweh's house,
and spread it before Yahweh.

# 1Isaiah 37:15
Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh,
saying,
# 1Isaiah 37:16
{
  Yahweh of Armies,
  the God of Israel,
  who is enthroned among the cherubim,
  you are the God,
  even you alone,
  of all the kingdoms of the earth.

  You have made heaven and earth.

  # 1Isaiah 37:17
  Turn your ear,
  Yahweh,
  and hear.

  Open your eyes,
  Yahweh,
  and behold.

  Hear all of the words of Sennacherib,
  who has sent to defy the living God.

  # 1Isaiah 37:18
  Truly,
  Yahweh,
  the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the countries and their land,

  # 1Isaiah 37:19
  and have cast their gods into the fire;
  for they were no gods,
  but the work of men's hands,
  wood and stone;
  therefore they have destroyed them.

  # 1Isaiah 37:20
  Now therefore,
  Yahweh our God,
  save us from his hand,
  that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you are Yahweh,
  even you only.
}

# 1Isaiah 37:21
Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah,
saying,
{
  Yahweh,
  the God of Israel says,
  {
    Because you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,

    # 1Isaiah 37:22
    this is the word which Yahweh has spoken concerning him:
    The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and ridiculed you.

    The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.

    # 1Isaiah 37:23
    Whom have you defied and blasphemed?

    Against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high?

    Against the Holy One of Israel.

    # 1Isaiah 37:24
    By your servants,
    you have defied the Lord,
    and have said,
    {
      With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains,
      to the innermost parts of Lebanon.

      I will cut down its tall cedars and its choice cypress trees.

      I will enter into its farthest height,
      the forest of its fruitful field.

      # 1Isaiah 37:25
      I have dug and drunk water,
      and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.
    }

    # 1Isaiah 37:26
    Have you not heard how I have done it long ago,
    and formed it in ancient times?

    Now I have brought it to pass,
    that it should be yours to destroy fortified cities,
    turning them into ruinous heaps.

    # 1Isaiah 37:27
    Therefore their inhabitants had little power.

    They were dismayed and confounded.

    They were like the grass of the field,
    and like the green herb,
    like the grass on the housetops,
    and like a field before its crop has grown.

    # 1Isaiah 37:28
    But I know your sitting down,
    your going out,
    your coming in,
    and your raging against me.

    # 1Isaiah 37:29
    Because of your raging against me,
    and because your arrogance has come up into my ears,
    therefore I will put my hook in your nose and my bridle in your lips,
    and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.

    # 1Isaiah 37:30
    This shall be the sign to you:
    You will eat this year that which grows of itself,
    and in the second year that which springs from it;
    and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards,
    and eat their fruit.

    # 1Isaiah 37:31
    The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward,
    and bear fruit upward.

    # 1Isaiah 37:32
    For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go out,
    and survivors will escape from Mount Zion.

    The zeal of Yahweh of Armies will perform this.
  }

  # 1Isaiah 37:33
  Therefore Yahweh says concerning the king of Assyria,
  {
    He will not come to this city,
    nor shoot an arrow there,
    neither will he come before it with shield,
    nor cast up a mound against it.

    # 1Isaiah 37:34
    He will return the way that he came,
    and he won't come to this city,
  }

  says Yahweh.

  # 1Isaiah 37:35
  {
    For I will defend this city to save it,
    for my own sake,
    and for my servant David's sake.
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 37:36
Then Yahweh's angel went out and struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians.

When men arose early in the morning,
behold,
these were all dead bodies.

# 1Isaiah 37:37
So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed,
went away,
returned to Nineveh,
and stayed there.

# 1Isaiah 37:38
As he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god,
Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him with the sword;
and they escaped into the land of Ararat.

Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.

# 1Isaiah 38:01
In those days Hezekiah was sick and near death.

Isaiah the prophet,
the son of Amoz,
came to him,
and said to him,
{
  Yahweh says,
  {
    Set your house in order,
    for you will die,
    and not live.
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 38:02
Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh,
# 1Isaiah 38:03
and said,
{
  Remember now,
  Yahweh,
  I beg you,
  how I have walked before you in truth and with a perfect heart,
  and have done that which is good in your sight.
}

Then Hezekiah wept bitterly.

# 1Isaiah 38:04
Then Yahweh's word came to Isaiah,
saying,
# 1Isaiah 38:05
{
  Go,
  and tell Hezekiah,
  {
    Yahweh,
    the God of David your father,
    says,
    {
      I have heard your prayer.

      I have seen your tears.

      Behold,
      I will add fifteen years to your life.

      # 1Isaiah 38:06
      I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria,
      and I will defend this city.

      # 1Isaiah 38:07
      This shall be the sign to you from Yahweh,
      that Yahweh will do this thing that he has spoken.

      # 1Isaiah 38:08
      Behold,
      I will cause the shadow on the sundial,
      which has gone down on the sundial of Ahaz with the sun,
      to return backward ten steps.
    }
  }
}

So the sun returned ten steps on the sundial on which it had gone down.

# 1Isaiah 38:09
The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah,
when he had been sick,
and had recovered of his sickness:
# 1Isaiah 38:10
I said,
{
  In the middle of my life I go into the gates of Sheol.

  I am deprived of the residue of my years.
}

# 1Isaiah 38:11
I said,
{
  I won't see Yah,
  Yah in the land of the living.

  I will see man no more with the inhabitants of the world.

  # 1Isaiah 38:12
  My dwelling is removed,
  and is carried away from me like a shepherd's tent.

  I have rolled up my life like a weaver.

  He will cut me off from the loom.

  From day even to night you will make an end of me.

  # 1Isaiah 38:13
  I waited patiently until morning.

  He breaks all my bones like a lion.

  From day even to night you will make an end of me.

  # 1Isaiah 38:14
  I chattered like a swallow or a crane.

  I moaned like a dove.

  My eyes weaken looking upward.

  Lord,
  I am oppressed.

  Be my security.
}

# 1Isaiah 38:15
What will I say?

He has both spoken to me,
and himself has done it.

I will walk carefully all my years because of the anguish of my soul.

# 1Isaiah 38:16
Lord,
men live by these things;
and my spirit finds life in all of them.

You restore me,
and cause me to live.

# 1Isaiah 38:17
Behold,
for peace I had great anguish,
but you have in love for my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;
for you have cast all my sins behind your back.

# 1Isaiah 38:18
For Sheol can't praise you.

Death can't celebrate you.

Those who go down into the pit can't hope for your truth.

# 1Isaiah 38:19
The living,
the living,
he shall praise you,
as I do today.

The father shall make known your truth to the children.

# 1Isaiah 38:20
Yahweh will save me.

Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments all the days of our life in Yahweh's house.

# 1Isaiah 38:21
Now Isaiah had said,
{
  Let them take a cake of figs,
  and lay it for a poultice on the boil,
  and he shall recover.
}

# 1Isaiah 38:22
Hezekiah also had said,
{
  What is the sign that I will go up to Yahweh's house?
}

# 1Isaiah 39:01
At that time,
Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan,
king of Babylon,
sent letters and a present to Hezekiah,
for he heard that he had been sick,
and had recovered.

# 1Isaiah 39:02
Hezekiah was pleased with them,
and showed them the house of his precious things,
the silver,
the gold,
the spices,
and the precious oil,
and all the house of his armor,
and all that was found in his treasures.

There was nothing in his house,
nor in all his dominion,
that Hezekiah didn't show them.

# 1Isaiah 39:03
Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah,
and asked him,
{
  What did these men say?

  From where did they come to you?
}

Hezekiah said,
{
  They have come from a country far from me,
  even from Babylon.
}

# 1Isaiah 39:04
Then he asked,
{
  What have they seen in your house?
}

Hezekiah answered,
{
  They have seen all that is in my house.

  There is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.
}

# 1Isaiah 39:05
Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah,
{
  Hear the word of Yahweh of Armies:

  # 1Isaiah 39:06
  {
    Behold,
    the days are coming when all that is in your house,
    and that which your fathers have stored up until today,
    will be carried to Babylon.

    Nothing will be left,
  }

  says Yahweh.

  # 1Isaiah 39:07
  {
    They will take away your sons who will issue from you,
    whom you shall father,
    and they will be eunuchs in the king of Babylon's palace.
  }
}

# 1Isaiah 39:08
Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah,
{
  Yahweh's word which you have spoken is good.
}

He said moreover,
{
  For there will be peace and truth in my days.
}
