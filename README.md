# WEB Bible Ventilated

## No Place to Hide

This is my experience since experimenting with ventilated prose in my Bible study.

```
  A ventilated text exposes  
    each word or phrase of Scripture  
        to my mind.
```

Thus, the words of Scripture have no place to hide from me.
And:

```
  The ventilated text exposes  
    my mind  
      to each word or phrase of Scripture.
```

Thus, I have no place to hide from Scripture.

## My Definition of Ventilation

Using LaTex my format includes the following:

- Line-and-a-half spacing the text.

- Breaking text into clauses, somewhat like poetry.

- A distinct section per page (where possible).

- No chapter numbers or verse numbers (though retained in source files)

This means there is a lot of whitespace all around the text to write notes

## Net Net

The creates documents that are a midpoint
between a word document and a powerpoint presentation.

I import the resulting PDFs into Notability on my iPad
to read, think, pray, and take notes.

## Interacting with Feedback from my Mother

My mother says she would never use these files 
because she cannot read the Bible without chapter and verse numbers.
For her, to not have the chapter and verse numbers is a distraction.
I acknowledge that this is a genuine difference between us.

I have long wondered what affect adding chapters and verses to the Bible has
on me as a reader.
These chapter and verse numbers were added a couple hundred years ago.
I can see their advantage in a sermon to reference a text.
However, all technologies have pros and cons.
What are the cons of having chapter and verse numbers in every printed version of the Bible?

This means I am creating this to ***read*** and to ***understand*** the Scriptures, not
***reference*** it to ***impress*** others or to ***argue*** with them.

  My Headings:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item The headings exist so that I can quickly find where I am reading.

    \item The headings are taken from the text that follows, often the first
      words.

    \item The headings are not meant to be read as you flip from page to page.
      I have positioned the headings in the same place on every page.
      Your eyes can count on the next text of the Scriptures being in the same
      place on each page.

    \item The Bible repeats, so my headings are going to repeat at times.

  \end{itemize}

  %-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Changes to the text:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Changing word order to sound more natural to me.

    \item Changing ``Behold, this happened.'' to ``Behold! This happened.''
      This is a word that is supposed to call our attention. The exclamation
      point was made for this purpose.

    \item I like to break LONG stuff into short stuff where it makes sense.
      Often, this will mean changing a semicolon into a period.

  \end{itemize}
