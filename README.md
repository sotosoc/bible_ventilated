# MYWEB Bible Ventilated

## MYWEB

I use the WEB Bible as a baseline for these files.
This is a public-domain translation of the Bible.

I substitute other translations for some texts.
Because of this, I call this the MYWEB translation.
If and where I substitute another translation,
I make note which translation.

I might also change word order to sound more natural to me.

I also change ``Behold, this happened.`` to ``Behold! This happened.``
The word ***behold*** is a word that is supposed to make me pay attention.
The exclamation mark was made for this purpose.

I like to break LONG stuff into short stuff where it makes sense.
Often, this will mean changing a semicolon into a period
if and where it helps to understand the text.

## No Place to Hide

This is my experience since experimenting with ventilated prose in my Bible study.

```
  A ventilated text exposes  
    each word or phrase of Scripture  
        to my mind.
```

Thus, the words of Scripture have no place to hide from me.
And:

```
  The ventilated text exposes  
    my mind  
      to each word or phrase of Scripture.
```

Thus, I have no place to hide from Scripture.

## My Definition of Ventilation

Using LaTex my format includes the following:

- Line-and-a-half spacing the text.

- Breaking text into clauses, somewhat like poetry.

- A distinct section per page (where possible).

- No chapter numbers or verse numbers (though retained in source files)

This means there is a lot of whitespace all around the text to write notes.

Net-Net.
These documents are a midpoint between a word document and a powerpoint
presentation.

## Ventilating Consistently

My primary goal is to ventilate the text of Scripture
so that the Word of God changes me.

  The Word of God will not return void.

I don't presently believe there is one correct way to ventilate a given passage.  
If I ventilate a passage twice, I will find that I do it differently each time.

As I read a ventilated passage,
I often make changes to the ventilation
because I think it can expose the text to my mind more effectively.

Maybe,
as I go through this process,
I will develop principles that will increase consistency.

## Page Headings

I currently include consecutively numbered headings in the document.
It does occur to me that these might be entirely unnecessary.
I may remove them at some point.

While these exist, these are my thoughts on them:

- Heading titles are taken from the text that follows,
  usually the very first words.
  I seek to be extensively uncreative in creating these headings.

- Headings are in the exact same place on every page.
  This means your eyes can anticipate the location of the firs line of text
  on the next page.
  I ignore these headings almost all of the time.

- Identical headings exist because the Bible repeats.

## How to Consume These Texts

How you consume the text is left as an exercise for you, the reader.

I import the resulting PDFs into Notability on my iPad
to read, think, pray, and take notes.

I have taken snapshots of a page to share
through email, text, or other electronic means.

I have (temporarily) eliminated many page breaks
and printed portions on old-fashioned paper.

## Interacting with Feedback from my Mother about Chapters and Verses

My mother says she would never use these files
because she cannot read the Bible without chapter and verse numbers.
For her, to ***not*** have the chapter and verse numbers is a distraction.
This is a genuine difference between us.

Chapter and verse and numbers are an invention of a couple hundred years ago. 
They have been considered largely inviolable ever since.

I am a skeptic when it comes to inventions.
All inventions have pros and cons.  

I can see the advantage of a preacher being able to reference a text for consideration.  
But what are the cons of having chapter and verse numbers
in almost every printed version of the Bible?

I created these to read and to understand the Scriptures,
not reference it to ***impress*** others or to ***argue*** with them.  
(I am prone to these sins.)
