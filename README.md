# WEB Bible Ventilated

## No Place to Hide

This is my experience since experimenting with ventilated prose in my Bible study.

```
  A ventilated text exposes  
    each word or phrase of Scripture  
        to my mind.
```

Thus, the words of Scripture have no place to hide from me.
And:

```
  The ventilated text exposes  
    my mind  
      to each word or phrase of Scripture.
```

Thus, I have no place to hide from Scripture.

## My Definition of Ventilation:

Using LaTex my format includes the following:

- Line-and-a-half spacing the text.

- Breaking text into clauses, somewhat like poetry.

- A distinct section per page (where possible).
  This document is a midpoint between a word document and a powerpoint
  presentation.
  Thus, this has not been created to be as a printed book.
  It has been created to be read into Notability (or like app) on a tablet
  computer to read, think, pray, and take notes.

- chapter numbers or verse numbers. I have long wondered what affect
      adding chapters and verses to the Bible has on me as a reader. These were
      only added a couple hundred years ago. Why are we certain that having
      them is wise? (This means I am creating this to READ and to UNDERSTAND
      the Scriptures, not REFERENCE it to IMPRESS others. However, to make it
      so more than one person can read and talk about the document, I have
      running heading numbers and page numbers.)

  My Headings:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item The headings exist so that I can quickly find where I am reading.

    \item The headings are taken from the text that follows, often the first
      words.

    \item The headings are not meant to be read as you flip from page to page.
      I have positioned the headings in the same place on every page.
      Your eyes can count on the next text of the Scriptures being in the same
      place on each page.

    \item The Bible repeats, so my headings are going to repeat at times.

  \end{itemize}

  %-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Changes to the text:

  \begin{itemize}

    \item Changing word order to sound more natural to me.

    \item Changing ``Behold, this happened.'' to ``Behold! This happened.''
      This is a word that is supposed to call our attention. The exclamation
      point was made for this purpose.

    \item I like to break LONG stuff into short stuff where it makes sense.
      Often, this will mean changing a semicolon into a period.

  \end{itemize}
