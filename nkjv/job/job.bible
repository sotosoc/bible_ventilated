# Job 1:1
There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job;
and that man was blameless and upright,
and one who feared God and shunned evil.

# Job 1:2
And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.

# Job 1:3
Also, his possessions were
7000 sheep,
3000 camels,
500 yoke of oxen,
500 female donkeys,
and a very large household,
so that this man
was the greatest of all the people of the East.

# Job 1:4
And his sons would go and feast in their houses,
each on his appointed day,
and would send and invite their three sisters
to eat and drink with them.

# Job 1:5
So it was,
when the days of feasting had run their course,
that Job would send and sanctify them,
and he would rise early in the morning
and offer burnt offerings
according to the number of them all.

For Job said,
{
  It may be that my sons have sinned
  and cursed God in their hearts.
}

Thus Job did regularly.

# Job 1:6
Now there was a day
when the sons of God came to present themselves
before the Lord,
and Satan also came among them.

# Job 1:7
And the Lord said to Satan,
{
  From where do you come?
}

So Satan answered the Lord and said,
{
  From going to and fro on the earth,
  and from walking back and forth on it.
}

# Job 1:8
Then the Lord said to Satan,
{
  Have you considered My servant Job,
  that there is none like him on the earth,
  a blameless and upright man,
  one who fears God and shuns evil?
}

# Job 1:9
So Satan answered the Lord and said,
{
  Does Job fear God for nothing?

# Job 1:10
  Have You not made a hedge around him,
  around his household,
  and around all that he has on every side?

  You have blessed the work of his hands,
  and his possessions have increased in the land.

# Job 1:11
  But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has,
  and he will surely curse You to Your face!
}

# Job 1:12
And the Lord said to Satan,
{
  Behold, all that he has is in your power;
  only do not lay a hand on his person.
}

So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord.

# Job 1:13
Now there was a day
when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine
in their oldest brother's house;
# Job 1:14
and a messenger came to Job and said,
{
  The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,
# Job 1:15
  when the Sabeans raided them and took them away --
  indeed they have killed the servants
  with the edge of the sword;
  and I alone have escaped to tell you!
}

# Job 1:16
While he was still speaking,
another also came and said,
{
  The fire of God fell from heaven
  and burned up the sheep and the servants,
  and consumed them;
  and I alone have escaped to tell you!
}

# Job 1:17
While he was still speaking,
another also came and said,
{
  The Chaldeans formed three bands,
  raided the camels and took them away,
  yes, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword;
  and I alone have escaped to tell you!
}

# Job 1:18
While he was still speaking,
another also came and said,
{
  Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine
  in their oldest brother's house,
# Job 1:19
  and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness
  and struck the four corners of the house,
  and it fell on the young people,
  and they are dead;
  and I alone have escaped to tell you!
}

# Job 1:20
Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head;
and he fell to the ground and worshiped.

# Job 1:21
And he said:
{
  Naked I came from my mother's womb,
  And naked shall I return there.

  The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away;
  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
}

# Job 1:22
In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrong.

# Job 2:1
Again there was a day
when the sons of God came
to present themselves before the Lord,
and Satan came also among them
to present himself before the Lord.

# Job 2:2
And the Lord said to Satan,
{
  From where do you come?
}

So Satan answered the Lord and said,
{
  From going to and fro on the earth,
  and from walking back and forth on it.
}

# Job 2:3
Then the Lord said to Satan,
{
  Have you considered My servant Job,
  that there is none like him on the earth,
  a blameless and upright man,
  one who fears God and shuns evil?

  And still he holds fast to his integrity,
  although you incited Me against him,
  to destroy him without cause.
}

# Job 2:4
So Satan answered the Lord and said,
{
  Skin for skin!

  Yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.

# Job 2:5
  But stretch out Your hand now,
  and touch his bone and his flesh,
  and he will surely curse You to Your face!
}

# Job 2:6
And the Lord said to Satan,
{
  Behold, he is in your hand, but spare his life.
}

# Job 2:7
So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord,
and struck Job with painful boils
from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.

# Job 2:8
And he took for himself a potsherd
with which to scrape himself
while he sat in the midst of the ashes.

# Job 2:9
Then his wife said to him,
{
  Do you still hold fast to your integrity?

  Curse God and die!
}

# Job 2:10
But he said to her,
{
  You speak as one of the foolish women speaks.

  Shall we indeed accept good from God,
  and shall we not accept adversity?
}

In all this Job did not sin with his lips.

# Job 2:11
Now when Job's three friends
heard of all this adversity that had come upon him,
each one came from his own place --
Eliphaz the Temanite,
Bildad the Shuhite,
and Zophar the Naamathite.

For they had made an appointment together
to come and mourn with him,
and to comfort him.

# Job 2:12
And when they raised their eyes from afar,
and did not recognize him,
they lifted their voices and wept;
and each one tore his robe
and sprinkled dust on his head toward heaven.

# Job 2:13
So they sat down with him on the ground
seven days and seven nights,
and no one spoke a word to him,
for they saw that his grief was very great.

# Job 3:1
After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.

# Job 3:2
And Job spoke, and said:
{
# Job 3:3
  May the day perish on which I was born,
  And the night in which it was said,
  {
    A male child is conceived.
  }

# Job 3:4
  May that day be darkness;
  May God above not seek it,
  Nor the light shine upon it.

# Job 3:5
  May darkness and the shadow of death claim it;
  May a cloud settle on it;
  May the blackness of the day terrify it.

# Job 3:6
  As for that night, may darkness seize it;
  May it not rejoice among the days of the year,
  May it not come into the number of the months.

# Job 3:7
  Oh, may that night be barren!

  May no joyful shout come into it!

# Job 3:8
  May those curse it who curse the day,
  Those who are ready to arouse Leviathan.

# Job 3:9
  May the stars of its morning be dark;
  May it look for light, but have none,
  And not see the dawning of the day;
# Job 3:10
  Because it did not shut up the doors of my mother's womb,
  Nor hide sorrow from my eyes.

# Job 3:11
  Why did I not die at birth?

  Why did I not perish when I came from the womb?

# Job 3:12
  Why did the knees receive me?

  Or why the breasts, that I should nurse?

# Job 3:13
  For now I would have lain still and been quiet,
  I would have been asleep;
  Then I would have been at rest

# Job 3:14
  With kings and counselors of the earth,
  Who built ruins for themselves,
# Job 3:15
  Or with princes who had gold,
  Who filled their houses with silver;
# Job 3:16
  Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child,
  Like infants who never saw light?

# Job 3:17
  There the wicked cease from troubling,
  And there the weary are at rest.

# Job 3:18
  There the prisoners rest together;
  They do not hear the voice of the oppressor.

# Job 3:19
  The small and great are there,
  And the servant is free from his master.

# Job 3:20
  Why is light given to him who is in misery,
  And life to the bitter of soul,
# Job 3:21
  Who long for death, but it does not come,
  And search for it more than hidden treasures;
# Job 3:22
  Who rejoice exceedingly,
  And are glad when they can find the grave?

# Job 3:23
  Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,
  And whom God has hedged in?

# Job 3:24
  For my sighing comes before I eat,
  And my groanings pour out like water.

# Job 3:25
  For the thing I greatly feared has come upon me,
  And what I dreaded has happened to me.

# Job 3:26
  I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;
  I have no rest, for trouble comes.
}

# Job 4:1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
{
# Job 4:2
  If one attempts a word with you, will you become weary?

  But who can withhold himself from speaking?

# Job 4:3
  Surely you have instructed many,
  And you have strengthened weak hands.

# Job 4:4
  Your words have upheld him who was stumbling,
  And you have strengthened the feeble knees;
# Job 4:5
  But now it comes upon you, and you are weary;
  It touches you, and you are troubled.

# Job 4:6
  Is not your reverence your confidence?

  And the integrity of your ways your hope?

# Job 4:7
  Remember now, who ever perished being innocent?

  Or where were the upright ever cut off?

# Job 4:8
  Even as I have seen,
  Those who plow iniquity
  And sow trouble reap the same.

# Job 4:9
  By the blast of God they perish,
  And by the breath of His anger they are consumed.

# Job 4:10
  The roaring of the lion,
  The voice of the fierce lion,
  And the teeth of the young lions are broken.

# Job 4:11
  The old lion perishes for lack of prey,
  And the cubs of the lioness are scattered.

# Job 4:12
  Now a word was secretly brought to me,
  And my ear received a whisper of it.

# Job 4:13
  In disquieting thoughts from the visions of the night,
  When deep sleep falls on men,

# Job 4:14
  Fear came upon me, and trembling,
  Which made all my bones shake.

# Job 4:15
  Then a spirit passed before my face;
  The hair on my body stood up.

# Job 4:16
  It stood still,
  But I could not discern its appearance.

  A form was before my eyes;
  There was silence;
  Then I heard a voice saying:
  {
# Job 4:17
    Can a mortal be more righteous than God?

    Can a man be more pure than his Maker?

# Job 4:18
    If He puts no trust in His servants,
    If He charges His angels with error,
# Job 4:19
    How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,
    Whose foundation is in the dust,
    Who are crushed before a moth?

# Job 4:20
    They are broken in pieces from morning till evening;
    They perish forever, with no one regarding.

# Job 4:21
    Does not their own excellence go away?

    They die, even without wisdom.
  }

# Job 5:1
  Call out now;
  Is there anyone who will answer you?

  And to which of the holy ones will you turn?

# Job 5:2
  For wrath kills a foolish man,
  And envy slays a simple one.

# Job 5:3
  I have seen the foolish taking root,
  But suddenly I cursed his dwelling place.

# Job 5:4
  His sons are far from safety,
  They are crushed in the gate,
  And there is no deliverer.

# Job 5:5
  Because the hungry eat up his harvest,
  Taking it even from the thorns,
  And a snare snatches their substance.

# Job 5:6
  For affliction does not come from the dust,
  Nor does trouble spring from the ground;
# Job 5:7
  Yet man is born to trouble,
  As the sparks fly upward.

# Job 5:8
  But as for me, I would seek God,
  And to God I would commit my cause --
# Job 5:9
  Who does great things, and unsearchable,
  Marvelous things without number.

# Job 5:10
  He gives rain on the earth,
  And sends waters on the fields.

# Job 5:11
  He sets on high those who are lowly,
  And those who mourn are lifted to safety.

# Job 5:12
  He frustrates the devices of the crafty,
  So that their hands cannot carry out their plans.

# Job 5:13
  He catches the wise in their own craftiness,
  And the counsel of the cunning comes quickly upon them.

# Job 5:14
  They meet with darkness in the daytime,
  And grope at noontime as in the night.

# Job 5:15
  But He saves the needy from the sword,
  From the mouth of the mighty,
  And from their hand.

# Job 5:16
  So the poor have hope,
  And injustice shuts her mouth.

# Job 5:17
  Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects;
  Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.

# Job 5:18
  For He bruises, but He binds up;
  He wounds, but His hands make whole.

# Job 5:19
  He shall deliver you in six troubles,
  Yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.

# Job 5:20
  In famine He shall redeem you from death,
  And in war from the power of the sword.

# Job 5:21
  You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue,
  And you shall not be afraid of destruction when it comes.

# Job 5:22
  You shall laugh at destruction and famine,
  And you shall not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

# Job 5:23
  For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field,
  And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.

# Job 5:24
  You shall know that your tent is in peace;
  You shall visit your dwelling and find nothing amiss.

# Job 5:25
  You shall also know that your descendants shall be many,
  And your offspring like the grass of the earth.

# Job 5:26
  You shall come to the grave at a full age,
  As a sheaf of grain ripens in its season.

# Job 5:27
  Behold, this we have searched out;
  It is true.

  Hear it, and know for yourself.
}

# Job 6:1
Then Job answered and said:
{
# Job 6:2
  Oh, that my grief were fully weighed,
  And my calamity laid with it on the scales!

# Job 6:3
  For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea --
  Therefore my words have been rash.

# Job 6:4
  For the arrows of the Almighty are within me;
  My spirit drinks in their poison;
  The terrors of God are arrayed against me.

# Job 6:5
  Does the wild donkey bray when it has grass,
  Or does the ox low over its fodder?

# Job 6:6
  Can flavorless food be eaten without salt?

  Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?

# Job 6:7
  My soul refuses to touch them;
  They are as loathsome food to me.

# Job 6:8
  Oh, that I might have my request,
  That God would grant me the thing that I long for!

# Job 6:9
  That it would please God to crush me,
  That He would loose His hand and cut me off!

# Job 6:10
  Then I would still have comfort;
  Though in anguish, I would exult, He will not spare;
  For I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.

# Job 6:11
  What strength do I have, that I should hope?

  And what is my end, that I should prolong my life?

# Job 6:12
  Is my strength the strength of stones?

  Or is my flesh bronze?

# Job 6:13
  Is my help not within me?

  And is success driven from me?

# Job 6:14
  To him who is afflicted, kindness should be shown by his friend,
  Even though he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.

# Job 6:15
  My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a brook,
  Like the streams of the brooks that pass away,
# Job 6:16
  Which are dark because of the ice,
  And into which the snow vanishes.

# Job 6:17
  When it is warm, they cease to flow;
  When it is hot, they vanish from their place.

# Job 6:18
  The paths of their way turn aside,
  They go nowhere and perish.

# Job 6:19
  The caravans of Tema look,
  The travelers of Sheba hope for them.

# Job 6:20
  They are disappointed because they were confident;
  They come there and are confused.

# Job 6:21
  For now you are nothing,
  You see terror and are afraid.

# Job 6:22
  Did I ever say,
  {
    Bring something to me
  }?

  Or,
  {
    Offer a bribe for me from your wealth
  }?

# Job 6:23
  Or,
  {
    Deliver me from the enemy's hand
  }?

  Or,
  {
    Redeem me from the hand of oppressors
  }?

# Job 6:24
  Teach me, and I will hold my tongue;
  Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.

# Job 6:25
  How forceful are right words!

  But what does your arguing prove?

# Job 6:26
  Do you intend to rebuke my words,
  And the speeches of a desperate one, which are as wind?

# Job 6:27
  Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless,
  And you undermine your friend.

# Job 6:28
  Now therefore, be pleased to look at me;
  For I would never lie to your face.

# Job 6:29
  Yield now, let there be no injustice!

  Yes, concede, my righteousness still stands!

# Job 6:30
  Is there injustice on my tongue?

  Cannot my taste discern the unsavory?

# Job 7:1
  Is there not a time of hard service for man on earth?

  Are not his days also like the days of a hired man?

# Job 7:2
  Like a servant who earnestly desires the shade,
  And like a hired man who eagerly looks for his wages,
# Job 7:3
  So I have been allotted months of futility,
  And wearisome nights have been appointed to me.

# Job 7:4
  When I lie down, I say,
  {
    When shall I arise,
    And the night be ended?
  }

  For I have had my fill of tossing till dawn.

# Job 7:5
  My flesh is caked with worms and dust,
  My skin is cracked and breaks out afresh.

# Job 7:6
  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle,
  And are spent without hope.

# Job 7:7
  Oh, remember that my life is a breath!

  My eye will never again see good.

# Job 7:8
  The eye of him who sees me will see me no more;
  While your eyes are upon me, I shall no longer be.

# Job 7:9
  As the cloud disappears and vanishes away,
  So he who goes down to the grave does not come up.

# Job 7:10
  He shall never return to his house,
  Nor shall his place know him anymore.

# Job 7:11
  Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;
  I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
  I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.

# Job 7:12
  Am I a sea, or a sea serpent,
  That You set a guard over me?

# Job 7:13
  When I say,
  {
    My bed will comfort me,
    My couch will ease my complaint,
  }

# Job 7:14
  Then You scare me with dreams
  And terrify me with visions,
# Job 7:15
  So that my soul chooses strangling
  And death rather than my body.

# Job 7:16
  I loathe my life;
  I would not live forever.

  Let me alone,
  For my days are but a breath.

# Job 7:17
  What is man, that You should exalt him,
  That You should set Your heart on him,
# Job 7:18
  That You should visit him every morning,
  And test him every moment?

# Job 7:19
  How long?

  Will You not look away from me,
  And let me alone till I swallow my saliva?

# Job 7:20
  Have I sinned?

  What have I done to You, O watcher of men?

  Why have You set me as Your target,
  So that I am a burden to myself?

# Job 7:21
  Why then do You not pardon my transgression,
  And take away my iniquity?

  For now I will lie down in the dust,
  And You will seek me diligently,
  But I will no longer be.
}

# Job 8:1
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
{
# Job 8:2
  How long will you speak these things,
  And the words of your mouth be like a strong wind?

# Job 8:3
  Does God subvert judgment?

  Or does the Almighty pervert justice?

# Job 8:4
  If your sons have sinned against Him,
  He has cast them away for their transgression.

# Job 8:5
  If you would earnestly seek God
  And make your supplication to the Almighty,
# Job 8:6
  If you were pure and upright,
  Surely now He would awake for you,
  And prosper your rightful dwelling place.

# Job 8:7
  Though your beginning was small,
  Yet your latter end would increase abundantly.

# Job 8:8
  For inquire, please, of the former age,
  And consider the things discovered by their fathers;
# Job 8:9
  For we were born yesterday,
  For we were born yesterday, and know nothing,
  Because our days on earth are a shadow.

# Job 8:10
  Will they not teach you and tell you,
  And utter words from their heart?

# Job 8:11
  Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh?

  Can the reeds flourish without water?

# Job 8:12
  While it is yet green and not cut down,
  It withers before any other plant.

# Job 8:13
  So are the paths of all who forget God;
  And the hope of the hypocrite shall perish,
# Job 8:14
  Whose confidence shall be cut off,
  And whose trust is a spider's web.

# Job 8:15
  He leans on his house, but it does not stand.

  He holds it fast, but it does not endure.

# Job 8:16
  He grows green in the sun,
  And his branches spread out in his garden.

# Job 8:17
  His roots wrap around the rock heap,
  And look for a place in the stones.

# Job 8:18
  If he is destroyed from his place,
  Then it will deny him, saying,
  {
    I have not seen you.
  }

# Job 8:19
  Behold, this is the joy of His way,
  And out of the earth others will grow.

# Job 8:20
  Behold, God will not cast away the blameless,
  Nor will He uphold the evildoers.

# Job 8:21
  He will yet fill your mouth with laughing,
  And your lips with rejoicing.

# Job 8:22
  Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,
  And the dwelling place of the wicked will come to nothing.
}

# Job 9:1
Then Job answered and said:
{
# Job 9:2
  Truly I know it is so,
  But how can a man be righteous before God?

# Job 9:3
  If one wished to contend with Him,
  He could not answer Him one time out of 1000.

# Job 9:4
  God is wise in heart and mighty in strength.

  Who has hardened himself against Him and prospered?

# Job 9:5
  He removes the mountains, and they do not know
  When He overturns them in His anger;
# Job 9:6
  He shakes the earth out of its place,
  And its pillars tremble;
# Job 9:7
  He commands the sun, and it does not rise;
  He seals off the stars;
# Job 9:8
  He alone spreads out the heavens,
  And treads on the waves of the sea;
# Job 9:9
  He made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
  And the chambers of the south;
# Job 9:10
  He does great things past finding out,
  Yes, wonders without number.

# Job 9:11
  If He goes by me, I do not see Him;
  If He moves past, I do not perceive Him;

# Job 9:12
  If He takes away, who can hinder Him?

  Who can say to Him,
  {
    What are You doing?
  }

# Job 9:13
  God will not withdraw His anger,
  The allies of the proud lie prostrate beneath Him.

# Job 9:14
  How then can I answer Him,
  And choose my words to reason with Him?

# Job 9:15
  For though I were righteous, I could not answer Him;
  I would beg mercy of my Judge.

# Job 9:16
  If I called and He answered me,
  I would not believe that He was listening to my voice.

# Job 9:17
  For He crushes me with a tempest,
  And multiplies my wounds without cause.

# Job 9:18
  He will not allow me to catch my breath,
  But fills me with bitterness.

# Job 9:19
  If it is a matter of strength, indeed He is strong;
  And if of justice, who will appoint my day in court?

# Job 9:20
  Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me;
  Though I were blameless, it would prove me perverse.

# Job 9:21
  I am blameless, yet I do not know myself;
  I despise my life.

# Job 9:22
  It is all one thing;
  Therefore I say,
  {
    He destroys the blameless and the wicked.
  }

# Job 9:23
  If the scourge slays suddenly,
  He laughs at the plight of the innocent.

# Job 9:24
  The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.

  He covers the faces of its judges.

  If it is not He, who else could it be?

# Job 9:25
  Now my days are swifter than a runner;
  They flee away, they see no good.

# Job 9:26
  They pass by like swift ships,
  Like an eagle swooping on its prey.

# Job 9:27
  If I say,
  {
    I will forget my complaint,
    I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,
  }
# Job 9:28
  I am afraid of all my sufferings;
  I know that You will not hold me innocent.

# Job 9:29
  If I am condemned,
  Why then do I labor in vain?

# Job 9:30
  If I wash myself with snow water,
  And cleanse my hands with soap,
# Job 9:31
  Yet You will plunge me into the pit,
  And my own clothes will abhor me.

# Job 9:32
  For He is not a man, as I am,
  That I may answer Him,
  And that we should go to court together.

# Job 9:33
  Nor is there any mediator between us,
  Who may lay his hand on us both.

# Job 9:34
  Let Him take His rod away from me,
  And do not let dread of Him terrify me.

# Job 9:35
  Then I would speak and not fear Him,
  But it is not so with me.

# Job 10:1
  My soul loathes my life;
  I will give free course to my complaint,
  I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

# Job 10:2
  I will say to God,
  {
    Do not condemn me;
    Show me why You contend with me.

# Job 10:3
    Does it seem good to You that You should oppress,
    That You should despise the work of Your hands,
    And smile on the counsel of the wicked?

# Job 10:4
    Do You have eyes of flesh?

    Or do You see as man sees?

# Job 10:5
    Are Your days like the days of a mortal man?

    Are Your years like the days of a mighty man,
# Job 10:6
    That You should seek for my iniquity
    And search out my sin,
# Job 10:7
    Although You know that I am not wicked,
    And there is no one who can deliver from Your hand?

# Job 10:8
    Your hands have made me and fashioned me,
    An intricate unity;
    Yet You would destroy me.

# Job 10:9
    Remember, I pray, that You have made me like clay.

    And will You turn me into dust again?

# Job 10:10
    Did you not pour me out like milk,
    And curdle me like cheese,
# Job 10:11
    Clothe me with skin and flesh,
    And knit me together with bones and sinews?

# Job 10:12
    You have granted me life and favor,
    And Your care has preserved my spirit.

# Job 10:13
    And these things You have hidden in Your heart;
    I know that this was with You:

# Job 10:14
    If I sin, then You mark me,
    And will not acquit me of my iniquity.

# Job 10:15
    If I am wicked, woe to me;
    Even if I am righteous,
    I cannot lift up my head.

    I am full of disgrace;
    See my misery!

# Job 10:16
    If my head is exalted,
    You hunt me like a fierce lion,
    And again You show Yourself awesome against me.

# Job 10:17
    You renew Your witnesses against me,
    And increase Your indignation toward me;
    Changes and war are ever with me.

# Job 10:18
    Why then have You brought me out of the womb?

    Oh, that I had perished and no eye had seen me!

# Job 10:19
    I would have been as though I had not been.

    I would have been carried from the womb to the grave.

# Job 10:20
    Are not my days few?

    Cease! Leave me alone, that I may take a little comfort,

# Job 10:21
    Before I go to the place from which I shall not return,
    To the land of darkness and the shadow of death,
# Job 10:22
    A land as dark as darkness itself,
    As the shadow of death, without any order,
    Where even the light is like darkness.

}

# Job 11:1
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
{
# Job 11:2
  Should not the multitude of words be answered?

  And should a man full of talk be vindicated?

# Job 11:3
  Should your empty talk make men hold their peace?

  And when you mock, should no one rebuke you?

# Job 11:4
  For you have said,
  {
    My doctrine is pure,
    And I am clean in your eyes.
  }

# Job 11:5
  But oh, that God would speak,
  And open His lips against you,
# Job 11:6
  That He would show you the secrets of wisdom!

  For they would double your prudence.

  Know therefore that God exacts from you
  Less than your iniquity deserves.

# Job 11:7
  Can you search out the deep things of God?

  Can you find out the limits of the Almighty?

# Job 11:8
  They are higher than heaven -- what can you do?

  Deeper than Sheol -- what can you know?

# Job 11:9
  Their measure is longer than the earth
  And broader than the sea.

# Job 11:10
  If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers to judgment,
  Then who can hinder Him?

# Job 11:11
  For He knows deceitful men;
  He sees wickedness also.

  Will He not then consider it?

# Job 11:12
  For an empty-headed man will be wise,
  When a wild donkey's colt is born a man.

# Job 11:13
  If you would prepare your heart,
  And stretch out your hands toward Him;
# Job 11:14
  If iniquity were in your hand, and you put it far away,
  And would not let wickedness dwell in your tents;
# Job 11:15
  Then surely you could lift up your face without spot;
  Yes, you could be steadfast, and not fear;
# Job 11:16
  Because you would forget your misery,
  And remember it as waters that have passed away,
# Job 11:17
  And your life would be brighter than noonday.

  Though you were dark, you would be like the morning.

# Job 11:18
  And you would be secure, because there is hope;
  Yes, you would dig around you, and take your rest in safety.

# Job 11:19
  You would also lie down, and no one would make you afraid;
  Yes, many would court your favor.

# Job 11:20
  But the eyes of the wicked will fail,
  And they shall not escape,
  And their hope -- loss of life!
}

# Job 12:1
Then Job answered and said:
{
# Job 12:2
  No doubt you are the people,
  And wisdom will die with you!

# Job 12:3
  But I have understanding as well as you;
  I am not inferior to you.

  Indeed, who does not know such things as these?

# Job 12:4
  I am one mocked by his friends,
  Who called on God, and He answered him,
  The just and blameless who is ridiculed.

# Job 12:5
  A lamp is despised in the thought of one who is at ease;
  It is made ready for those whose feet slip.

# Job 12:6
  The tents of robbers prosper,
  And those who provoke God are secure --
  In what God provides by His hand.

# Job 12:7
  But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you;
  And the birds of the air, and they will tell you;

# Job 12:8
  Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you;
  And the fish of the sea will explain to you.

# Job 12:9
  Who among all these does not know
  That the hand of the Lord has done this,
# Job 12:10
  In whose hand is the life of every living thing,
  And the breath of all mankind?

# Job 12:11
  Does not the ear test words
  And the mouth taste its food?

# Job 12:12
  Wisdom is with aged men,
  And with length of days, understanding.

# Job 12:13
  With Him are wisdom and strength,
  He has counsel and understanding.

# Job 12:14
  If He breaks a thing down, it cannot be rebuilt;
  If He imprisons a man, there can be no release.

# Job 12:15
  If He withholds the waters, they dry up;
  If He sends them out, they overwhelm the earth.

# Job 12:16
  With Him are strength and prudence.

  The deceived and the deceiver are His.

# Job 12:17
  He leads counselors away plundered,
  And makes fools of the judges.

# Job 12:18
  He loosens the bonds of kings,
  And binds their waist with a belt.

# Job 12:19
  He leads princes away plundered,
  And overthrows the mighty.

# Job 12:20
  He deprives the trusted ones of speech,
  And takes away the discernment of the elders.

# Job 12:21
  He pours contempt on princes,
  And disarms the mighty.

# Job 12:22
  He uncovers deep things out of darkness,
  And brings the shadow of death to light.

# Job 12:23
  He makes nations great, and destroys them;
  He enlarges nations, and guides them.

# Job 12:24
  He takes away the understanding
    of the chiefs
    of the people
    of the earth,
  And makes them wander in a pathless wilderness.

# Job 12:25
  They grope in the dark without light,
  And He makes them stagger like a drunken man.

# Job 13:1
  Behold, my eye has seen all this,
  My ear has heard and understood it.

# Job 13:2
  What you know, I also know;
  I am not inferior to you.

# Job 13:3
  But I would speak to the Almighty,
  And I desire to reason with God.

# Job 13:4
  But you forgers of lies,
  You are all worthless physicians.

# Job 13:5
  Oh, that you would be silent,
  And it would be your wisdom!

# Job 13:6
  Now hear my reasoning,
  And heed the pleadings of my lips.

# Job 13:7
  Will you speak wickedly for God,
  And talk deceitfully for Him?

# Job 13:8
  Will you show partiality for Him?

  Will you contend for God?

# Job 13:9
  Will it be well when He searches you out?

  Or can you mock Him as one mocks a man?

# Job 13:10
  He will surely rebuke you
  If you secretly show partiality.

# Job 13:11
  Will not His excellence make you afraid,
  And the dread of Him fall upon you?

# Job 13:12
  Your platitudes are proverbs of ashes,
  Your defenses are defenses of clay.

# Job 13:13
  Hold your peace with me, and let me speak,
  Then let come on me what may!

# Job 13:14
  Why do I take my flesh in my teeth,
  And put my life in my hands?

# Job 13:15
  Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him.

  Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him.

# Job 13:16
  He also shall be my salvation,
  For a hypocrite could not come before Him.

# Job 13:17
  Listen carefully to my speech,
  And to my declaration with your ears.

# Job 13:18
  See now, I have prepared my case,
  I know that I shall be vindicated.

# Job 13:19
  Who is he who will contend with me?

  If now I hold my tongue, I perish.

# Job 13:20
  Only two things do not do to me,
  Then I will not hide myself from You:
# Job 13:21
    Withdraw Your hand far from me,
    And let not the dread of You make me afraid.

# Job 13:22
  Then call, and I will answer;
  Or let me speak, then You respond to me.

# Job 13:23
  How many are my iniquities and sins?

  Make me know my transgression and my sin.

# Job 13:24
  Why do You hide Your face,
  And regard me as Your enemy?

# Job 13:25
  Will You frighten a leaf driven to and fro?

  And will You pursue dry stubble?

# Job 13:26
  For You write bitter things against me,
  And make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.

# Job 13:27
  You put my feet in the stocks,
  And watch closely all my paths.

  You set a limit for the soles of my feet.

# Job 13:28
  Man decays like a rotten thing,
  Like a garment that is moth-eaten.

# Job 14:1
  Man who is born of woman
  Is of few days and full of trouble.

# Job 14:2
  He comes forth like a flower and fades away;
  He flees like a shadow and does not continue.

# Job 14:3
  And do You open Your eyes on such a one,
  And bring me to judgment with Yourself?

# Job 14:4
  Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?

  No one!

# Job 14:5
  Since his days are determined,
  The number of his months is with You;
  You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass.

# Job 14:6
  Look away from him that he may rest,
  Till like a hired man he finishes his day.

# Job 14:7
  For there is hope for a tree,
  If it is cut down, that it will sprout again,
  And that its tender shoots will not cease.

# Job 14:8
  Though its root may grow old in the earth,
  And its stump may die in the ground,
# Job 14:9
  Yet at the scent of water it will bud
  And bring forth branches like a plant.

# Job 14:10
  But man dies and is laid away;
  Indeed he breathes his last
  And where is he?

# Job 14:11
  As water disappears from the sea,
  And a river becomes parched and dries up,

# Job 14:12
  So man lies down and does not rise.

  Till the heavens are no more,
  They will not awake
  Nor be roused from their sleep.

# Job 14:13
  Oh, that You would hide me in the grave,
  That You would conceal me until Your wrath is past,
  That You would appoint me a set time, and remember me!

# Job 14:14
  If a man dies, shall he live again?

  All the days of my hard service I will wait,
  Till my change comes.

# Job 14:15
  You shall call, and I will answer You;
  You shall desire the work of Your hands.

# Job 14:16
  For now You number my steps,
  But do not watch over my sin.

# Job 14:17
  My transgression is sealed up in a bag,
  And You cover my iniquity.

# Job 14:18
  But as a mountain falls and crumbles away,
  And as a rock is moved from its place;
# Job 14:19
  As water wears away stones,
  And as torrents wash away the soil of the earth;
  So You destroy the hope of man.

# Job 14:20
  You prevail forever against him, and he passes on;
  You change his countenance and send him away.

# Job 14:21
  His sons come to honor, and he does not know it;
  They are brought low, and he does not perceive it.

# Job 14:22
  But his flesh will be in pain over it,
  And his soul will mourn over it.
}

# Job 15:1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
{
  Should a wise man answer with empty knowledge,
  And fill himself with the east wind?

# Job 15:2
  Should he reason with unprofitable talk,
  Or by speeches with which he can do no good?

# Job 15:3
  Yes, you cast off fear,
  And restrain prayer before God.

# Job 15:4
  For your iniquity teaches your mouth,
  And you choose the tongue of the crafty.

# Job 15:5
  Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;
  Yes, your own lips testify against you.

# Job 15:6
  Are you the first man who was born?

  Or were you made before the hills?

# Job 15:7
  Have you heard the counsel of God?

  Do you limit wisdom to yourself?

# Job 15:8
  What do you know that we do not know?

  What do you understand that is not in us?

# Job 15:9
  Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us,
  Much older than your father.

# Job 15:10
  Are the consolations of God too small for you,
  And the word spoken gently with you?

# Job 15:11
  Why does your heart carry you away,
  And what do your eyes wink at,
# Job 15:12
  That you turn your spirit against God,
  And let such words go out of your mouth?

# Job 15:13
  What is man, that he could be pure?

  And he who is born of a woman, that he could be righteous?

# Job 15:14
  If God puts no trust in His saints,
  And the heavens are not pure in His sight,
# Job 15:15
  How much less man, who is abominable and filthy,
  Who drinks iniquity like water!

# Job 15:16
  I will tell you, hear me;
  What I have seen I will declare,
# Job 15:17
  What wise men have told,
  Not hiding anything received from their fathers,
# Job 15:18
  To whom alone the land was given,
  And no alien passed among them:
# Job 15:19
    The wicked man writhes with pain all his days,
    And the number of years is hidden from the oppressor.

# Job 15:20
  Dreadful sounds are in his ears;
  In prosperity the destroyer comes upon him.

# Job 15:21
  He does not believe that he will return from darkness,
  For a sword is waiting for him.

# Job 15:22
  He wanders about for bread, saying, "Where is it?"

  He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand.

# Job 15:23
  Trouble and anguish make him afraid;
  They overpower him, like a king ready for battle.

# Job 15:24
  For he stretches out his hand against God,
  And acts defiantly against the Almighty,
# Job 15:25
  Running stubbornly against Him
  With his strong, embossed shield.

# Job 15:26
  Though he has covered his face with his fatness,
  And made his waist heavy with fat,
# Job 15:27
  He dwells in desolate cities,
  In houses which no one inhabits,
  Which are destined to become ruins.

# Job 15:28
  He will not be rich,
  Nor will his wealth continue,
  Nor will his possessions overspread the earth.

# Job 15:29
  He will not depart from darkness;
  The flame will dry out his branches,
  And by the breath of His mouth he will go away.

# Job 15:30
  Let him not trust in futile things, deceiving himself,
  For futility will be his reward.

# Job 15:31
  It will be accomplished before his time,
  And his branch will not be green.

# Job 15:32
  He will shake off his unripe grape like a vine,
  And cast off his blossom like an olive tree.

# Job 15:33
  For the company of hypocrites will be barren,
  And fire will consume the tents of bribery.

# Job 15:34
  They conceive trouble and bring forth futility;
  Their womb prepares deceit.
}

# Job 16:1
Then Job answered and said:
{
# Job 16:2
  I have heard many such things;
  Miserable comforters are you all!

# Job 16:3
  Shall words of wind have an end?

  Or what provokes you that you answer?

# Job 16:4
  I also could speak as you do,
  If your soul were in my soul's place.

  I could heap up words against you,
  And shake my head at you;
# Job 16:5
  But I would strengthen you with my mouth,
  And the comfort of my lips would relieve your grief.

# Job 16:6
  Though I speak, my grief is not relieved;
  And if I remain silent, how am I eased?

# Job 16:7
  But now He has worn me out;
  You have made desolate all my company.

# Job 16:8
  You have shriveled me up,
  And it is a witness against me;
  My leanness rises up against me
  And bears witness to my face.

# Job 16:9
  He tears me in His wrath, and hates me;
  He gnashes at me with His teeth;
  My adversary sharpens His gaze on me.

# Job 16:10
  They gape at me with their mouth,
  They strike me reproachfully on the cheek,
  They gather together against me.

# Job 16:11
  God has delivered me to the ungodly,
  And turned me over to the hands of the wicked.

# Job 16:12
  I was at ease, but He has shattered me;
  He also has taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces;
  He has set me up for His target,
# Job 16:13
  His archers surround me.

  He pierces my heart and does not pity;
  He pours out my gall on the ground.

# Job 16:14
  He breaks me with wound upon wound;
  He runs at me like a warrior.

# Job 16:15
  I have sewn sackcloth over my skin,
  And laid my head in the dust.

# Job 16:16
  My face is flushed from weeping,
  And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
# Job 16:17
  Although no violence is in my hands,
  And my prayer is pure.

# Job 16:18
  O earth, do not cover my blood,
  And let my cry have no resting place!

# Job 16:19
  Surely even now my witness is in heaven,
  And my evidence is on high.

# Job 16:20
  My friends scorn me;
  My eyes pour out tears to God.

# Job 16:21
  Oh, that one might plead for a man with God,
  As a man pleads for his neighbor!

# Job 16:22
  For when a few years are finished,
  I shall go the way of no return.

# Job 17:1
  My spirit is broken,
  My days are extinguished,
  The grave is ready for me.

# Job 17:2
  Are not mockers with me?

  And does not my eye dwell on their provocation?

# Job 17:3
  Now put down a pledge for me with Yourself.

  Who is he who will shake hands with me?

# Job 17:4
  For You have hidden their heart from understanding;
  Therefore You will not exalt them.

# Job 17:5
  He who speaks flattery to his friends,
  Even the eyes of his children will fail.

# Job 17:6
  But He has made me a byword of the people,
  And I have become one in whose face men spit.

# Job 17:7
  My eye has also grown dim because of sorrow,
  And all my members are like shadows.

# Job 17:8
  Upright men are astonished at this,
  And the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite.

# Job 17:9
  Yet the righteous will hold to his way,
  And he who has clean hands will be stronger and stronger.

# Job 17:10
  But please, come back again, all of you,
  For I shall not find one wise man among you.

# Job 17:11
  My days are past,
  My purposes are broken off,
  Even the thoughts of my heart.

# Job 17:12
  They change the night into day;
  {
    The light is near,
  }
  they say, in the face of darkness.

# Job 17:13
  If I wait for the grave as my house,
  If I make my bed in the darkness,
# Job 17:14
  If I say to corruption,
  {
    You are my father,
  }
  And to the worm,
  {
    You are my mother and my sister,
  }

# Job 17:15
  Where then is my hope?

  As for my hope, who can see it?

# Job 17:16
  Will they go down to the gates of Sheol?

  Shall we have rest together in the dust?
}

# Job 18:1
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
{
# Job 18:2
  How long till you put an end to words?

  Gain understanding, and afterward we will speak.

# Job 18:3
  Why are we counted as beasts,
  And regarded as stupid in your sight?

# Job 18:4
  You who tear yourself in anger,
  Shall the earth be forsaken for you?

  Or shall the rock be removed from its place?

# Job 18:5
  The light of the wicked indeed goes out,
  And the flame of his fire does not shine.

# Job 18:6
  The light is dark in his tent,
  And his lamp beside him is put out.

# Job 18:7
  The steps of his strength are shortened,
  And his own counsel casts him down.

# Job 18:8
  For he is cast into a net by his own feet,
  And he walks into a snare.

# Job 18:9
  The net takes him by the heel,
  And a snare lays hold of him.

# Job 18:10
  A noose is hidden for him on the ground,
  And a trap for him in the road.

# Job 18:11
  Terrors frighten him on every side,
  And drive him to his feet.

# Job 18:12
  His strength is starved,
  And destruction is ready at his side.

# Job 18:13
  It devours patches of his skin;
  The firstborn of death devours his limbs.

# Job 18:14
  He is uprooted from the shelter of his tent,
  And they parade him before the king of terrors.

# Job 18:15
  They dwell in his tent who are none of his;
  Brimstone is scattered on his dwelling.

# Job 18:16
  His roots are dried out below,
  And his branch withers above.

# Job 18:17
  The memory of him perishes from the earth,
  And he has no name among the renowned.

# Job 18:18
  He is driven from light into darkness,
  And chased out of the world.

# Job 18:19
  He has neither son nor posterity among his people,
  Nor any remaining in his dwellings.

# Job 18:20
  Those in the west are astonished at his day,
  As those in the east are frightened.

# Job 18:21
  Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked,
  And this is the place of him who does not know God.
}

# Job 19:1
Then Job answered and said:
{
# Job 19:2
  How long will you torment my soul,
  And break me in pieces with words?

# Job 19:3
  These 10 times you have reproached me;
  You are not ashamed that you have wronged me.

# Job 19:4
  And if indeed I have erred,
  My error remains with me.

# Job 19:5
  If indeed you exalt yourselves against me,
  And plead my disgrace against me,

# Job 19:6
  Know then that God has wronged me,
  And has surrounded me with His net.

# Job 19:7
  If I cry out concerning wrong, I am not heard.

  If I cry aloud, there is no justice.

# Job 19:8
  He has fenced up my way, so that I cannot pass;
  And He has set darkness in my paths.

# Job 19:9
  He has stripped me of my glory,
  And taken the crown from my head.

# Job 19:10
  He breaks me down on every side,
  And I am gone;
  My hope He has uprooted like a tree.

# Job 19:11
  He has also kindled His wrath against me,
  And He counts me as one of His enemies.

# Job 19:12
  His troops come together
  And build up their road against me;
  They encamp all around my tent.

# Job 19:13
  He has removed my brothers far from me,
  And my acquaintances are completely estranged from me.

# Job 19:14
  My relatives have failed,
  And my close friends have forgotten me.

# Job 19:15
  Those who dwell in my house, and my maidservants,
  Count me as a stranger;
  I am an alien in their sight.

# Job 19:16
  I call my servant, but he gives no answer;
  I beg him with my mouth.

# Job 19:17
  My breath is offensive to my wife,
  And I am repulsive to the children of my own body.

# Job 19:18
  Even young children despise me;
  I arise, and they speak against me.

# Job 19:19
  All my close friends abhor me,
  And those whom I love have turned against me.

# Job 19:20
  My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh,
  And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.

# Job 19:21
  Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends,
  For the hand of God has struck me!

# Job 19:22
  Why do you persecute me as God does,
  And are not satisfied with my flesh?

# Job 19:23
  Oh, that my words were written!

  Oh, that they were inscribed in a book!

# Job 19:24
  That they were engraved on a rock
  With an iron pen and lead, forever!

# Job 19:25
  For I know that my Redeemer lives,
  And He shall stand at last on the earth;
# Job 19:26
  And after my skin is destroyed, this I know,
  That in my flesh I shall see God,

# Job 19:27
  Whom I shall see for myself,
  And my eyes shall behold, and not another.

  How my heart yearns within me!

# Job 19:28
  If you should say, "How shall we persecute him?"--
  Since the root of the matter is found in me,

# Job 19:29
  Be afraid of the sword for yourselves;
  For wrath brings the punishment of the sword,
  That you may know there is a judgment.
}

# Job 20:1
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said:
{
# Job 20:2
  Therefore my anxious thoughts make me answer,
  Because of the turmoil within me.

# Job 20:3
  I have heard the rebuke that reproaches me,
  And the spirit of my understanding causes me to answer.

# Job 20:4
  Do you not know this of old,
  Since man was placed on earth,

# Job 20:5
  That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
  And the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment?

# Job 20:6
  Though his haughtiness mounts up to the heavens,
  And his head reaches to the clouds,
# Job 20:7
  Yet he will perish forever like his own refuse;
  Those who have seen him will say, "Where is he?"

# Job 20:8
  He will fly away like a dream, and not be found;
  Yes, he will be chased away like a vision of the night.

# Job 20:9
  The eye that saw him will see him no more,
  Nor will his place behold him anymore.

# Job 20:10
  His children will seek the favor of the poor,
  And his hands will restore his wealth.

# Job 20:11
  His bones are full of his youthful vigor,
  But it will lie down with him in the dust.

# Job 20:12
  Though evil is sweet in his mouth,
  And he hides it under his tongue,

# Job 20:13
  Though he spares it and does not forsake it,
  But still keeps it in his mouth,

# Job 20:14
  Yet his food in his stomach turns sour;
  It becomes cobra venom within him.

# Job 20:15
  He swallows down riches
  And vomits them up again;
  God casts them out of his belly.

# Job 20:16
  He will suck the poison of cobras;
  The viper's tongue will slay him.

# Job 20:17
  He will not see the streams,
  The rivers flowing with honey and cream.

# Job 20:18
  He will restore that for which he labored,
  And will not swallow it down;
  From the proceeds of business He will get no enjoyment.

# Job 20:19
  For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor,
  He has violently seized a house which he did not build.

# Job 20:20
  Because he knows no quietness in his heart,
  He will not save anything he desires.

# Job 20:21
  Nothing is left for him to eat;
  Therefore his well-being will not last.

# Job 20:22
  In his self-sufficiency he will be in distress;
  Every hand of misery will come against him.

# Job 20:23
  When he is about to fill his stomach,
  God will cast on him the fury of His wrath,
  And will rain it on him while he is eating.

# Job 20:24
  He will flee from the iron weapon;
  A bronze bow will pierce him through.

# Job 20:25
  It is drawn, and comes out of the body;
  Yes, the glittering point comes out of his gall.

  Terrors come upon him;

# Job 20:26
  Total darkness is reserved for his treasures.

  An unfanned fire will consume him;
  It shall go ill with him who is left in his tent.

# Job 20:27
  The heavens will reveal his iniquity,
  And the earth will rise up against him.

# Job 20:28
  The increase of his house will depart,
  And his goods will flow away in the day of His wrath.

# Job 20:29
  This is the portion from God for a wicked man,
  The heritage appointed to him by God.
}

# Job 21:1
Then Job answered and said:
{
# Job 21:2
  Listen carefully to my speech,
  And let this be your consolation.

# Job 21:3
  Bear with me that I may speak,
  And after I have spoken, keep mocking.

# Job 21:4
  As for me, is my complaint against man?

  And if it were, why should I not be impatient?

# Job 21:5
  Look at me and be astonished;
  Put your hand over your mouth.

# Job 21:6
  Even when I remember I am terrified,
  And trembling takes hold of my flesh.

# Job 21:7
  Why do the wicked live and become old,
  Yes, become mighty in power?

# Job 21:8
  Their descendants are established with them in their sight,
  And their offspring before their eyes.

# Job 21:9
  Their houses are safe from fear,
  Neither is the rod of God upon them.

# Job 21:10
  Their bull breeds without failure;
  Their cow calves without miscarriage.

# Job 21:11
  They send forth their little ones like a flock,
  And their children dance.

# Job 21:12
  They sing to the tambourine and harp,
  And rejoice to the sound of the flute.

# Job 21:13
  They spend their days in wealth,
  And in a moment go down to the grave.

# Job 21:14
  Yet they say to God,
  {
    Depart from us,
    For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.

# Job 21:15
    Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him?

    And what profit do we have if we pray to Him?
  }

# Job 21:16
  Indeed their prosperity is not in their hand;
  The counsel of the wicked is far from me.

# Job 21:17
  How often is the lamp of the wicked put out?

  How often does their destruction come upon them,
  The sorrows God distributes in His anger?

# Job 21:18
  They are like straw before the wind,
  And like chaff that a storm carries away.

# Job 21:19
  They say, "God lays up one's iniquity for his children";
  Let Him recompense him, that he may know it.

# Job 21:20
  Let his eyes see his destruction,
  And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.

# Job 21:21
  For what does he care about his household after him,
  When the number of his months is cut in half?

# Job 21:22
  Can anyone teach God knowledge,
  Since He judges those on high?

# Job 21:23
  One dies in his full strength,
  Being wholly at ease and secure;

# Job 21:24
  His pails are full of milk,
  And the marrow of his bones is moist.

# Job 21:25
  Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul,
  Never having eaten with pleasure.

# Job 21:26
  They lie down alike in the dust,
  And worms cover them.

# Job 21:27
  Look, I know your thoughts,
  And the schemes with which you would wrong me.

# Job 21:28
  For you say,
  {
    Where is the house of the prince?

    And where is the tent,
    The dwelling place of the wicked?
  }

# Job 21:29
  Have you not asked those who travel the road?

  And do you not know their signs?

# Job 21:30
  For the wicked are reserved for the day of doom;
  They shall be brought out on the day of wrath.

# Job 21:31
  Who condemns his way to his face?

  And who repays him for what he has done?

# Job 21:32
  Yet he shall be brought to the grave,
  And a vigil kept over the tomb.

# Job 21:33
  The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him;
  Everyone shall follow him,
  As countless have gone before him.

# Job 21:34
  How then can you comfort me with empty words,
  Since falsehood remains in your answers?
}

# Job 22:1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:
{
# Job 22:2
  Can a man be profitable to God,
  Though he who is wise may be profitable to himself?

# Job 22:3
  Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that you are righteous?

  Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways blameless?

# Job 22:4
  Is it because of your fear of Him that He corrects you,
  And enters into judgment with you?

# Job 22:5
  Is not your wickedness great,
  And your iniquity without end?

# Job 22:6
  For you have taken pledges from your brother for no reason,
  And stripped the naked of their clothing.

# Job 22:7
  You have not given the weary water to drink,
  And you have withheld bread from the hungry.

# Job 22:8
  But the mighty man possessed the land,
  And the honorable man dwelt in it.

# Job 22:9
  You have sent widows away empty,
  And the strength of the fatherless was crushed.

# Job 22:10
  Therefore snares are all around you,
  And sudden fear troubles you,

# Job 22:11
  Or darkness so that you cannot see;
  And an abundance of water covers you.

# Job 22:12
  Is not God in the height of heaven?

  And see the highest stars, how lofty they are!

# Job 22:13
  And you say,
  {
    What does God know?

    Can He judge through the deep darkness?

# Job 22:14
    Thick clouds cover Him, so that He cannot see,
    And He walks above the circle of heaven.
  }

# Job 22:15
  Will you keep to the old way
  Which wicked men have trod,

# Job 22:16
  Who were cut down before their time,
  Whose foundations were swept away by a flood?

# Job 22:17
  They said to God,
  {
    Depart from us!

    What can the Almighty do to them?
  }

# Job 22:18
  Yet He filled their houses with good things;
  But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.

# Job 22:19
  The righteous see it and are glad,
  And the innocent laugh at them:

  {
# Job 22:20
    Surely our adversaries are cut down,
    And the fire consumes their remnant.
  }

# Job 22:21
  Now acquaint yourself with Him, and be at peace;
  Thereby good will come to you.

# Job 22:22
  Receive, please, instruction from His mouth,
  And lay up His words in your heart.

# Job 22:23
  If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up;
  You will remove iniquity far from your tents.

# Job 22:24
  Then you will lay your gold in the dust,
  And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.

# Job 22:25
  Yes, the Almighty will be your gold
  And your precious silver;

# Job 22:26
  For then you will have your delight in the Almighty,
  And lift up your face to God.

# Job 22:27
  You will make your prayer to Him,
  He will hear you,
  And you will pay your vows.

# Job 22:28
  You will also declare a thing,
  And it will be established for you;
  So light will shine on your ways.

# Job 22:29
  When they cast you down, and you say,
  {
    Exaltation will come!
  }
  Then He will save the humble person.

# Job 22:30
  He will even deliver one who is not innocent;
  Yes, he will be delivered by the purity of your hands.
}

# Job 23:1
Then Job answered and said:
{
# Job 23:2
  Even today my complaint is bitter;
  My hand is listless because of my groaning.

# Job 23:3
  Oh, that I knew where I might find Him,
  That I might come to His seat!

# Job 23:4
  I would present my case before Him,
  And fill my mouth with arguments

# Job 23:5
  I would know the words which He would answer me,
  And understand what He would say to me.

# Job 23:6
  Would He contend with me in His great power?

  No! But He would take note of me.

# Job 23:7
  There the upright could reason with Him,
  And I would be delivered forever from my Judge.

# Job 23:8
  Look, I go forward, but He is not there,
  And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;

# Job 23:9
  When He works on the left hand, I cannot behold Him;
  When He turns to the right hand, I cannot see Him.

# Job 23:10
  But He knows the way that I take;
  When He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold.

# Job 23:11
  My foot has held fast to His steps;
  I have kept His way and not turned aside.

# Job 23:12
  I have not departed from the commandment of His lips;
  I have treasured the words of His mouth
  More than my necessary food.

# Job 23:13
  But He is unique, and who can make Him change?

  And whatever His soul desires, that He does.

# Job 23:14
  For He performs what is appointed for me,
  And many such things are with Him

# Job 23:15
  Therefore I am terrified at His presence;
  When I consider this, I am afraid of Him.

# Job 23:16
  For God made my heart weak,
  And the Almighty terrifies me;

# Job 23:17
  Because I was not cut off from the presence of darkness,
  And He did not hide deep darkness from my face.

# Job 24:1
  Since times are not hidden from the Almighty,
  Why do those who know Him see not His days?

# Job 24:2
  Some remove landmarks;
  They seize flocks violently and feed on them;

# Job 24:3
  They drive away the donkey of the fatherless;
  They take the widow's ox as a pledge.

# Job 24:4
  They push the needy off the road;
  All the poor of the land are forced to hide.

# Job 24:5
  Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert,
  They go out to their work, searching for food.

  The wilderness yields food for them and for their children.

# Job 24:6
  They gather their fodder in the field
  And glean in the vineyard of the wicked.

# Job 24:7
  They spend the night naked, without clothing,
  And have no covering in the cold.

# Job 24:8
  They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
  And huddle around the rock for want of shelter.

# Job 24:9
  Some snatch the fatherless from the breast,
  And take a pledge from the poor.

# Job 24:10
  They cause the poor to go naked, without clothing;
  And they take away the sheaves from the hungry.

# Job 24:11
  They press out oil within their walls,
  And tread winepresses, yet suffer thirst.

# Job 24:12
  The dying groan in the city,
  And the souls of the wounded cry out;
  Yet God does not charge them with wrong.

# Job 24:13
  There are those who rebel against the light;
  They do not know its ways
  Nor abide in its paths.

# Job 24:14
  The murderer rises with the light;
  He kills the poor and needy;
  And in the night he is like a thief.

# Job 24:15
  The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight,
  Saying, "No eye will see me";
  And he disguises his face.

# Job 24:16
  In the dark they break into houses
  Which they marked for themselves in the daytime;
  They do not know the light.

# Job 24:17
  For the morning is the same to them as the shadow of death;
  If someone recognizes them,
  They are in the terrors of the shadow of death.

# Job 24:18
  They should be swift on the face of the waters,
  Their portion should be cursed in the earth,
  So that no one would turn into the way of their vineyards.

# Job 24:19
  As drought and heat consume the snow waters,
  So the grave consumes those who have sinned.

# Job 24:20
  The womb should forget him,
  The worm should feed sweetly on him;
  He should be remembered no more,
  And wickedness should be broken like a tree.

# Job 24:21
  For he preys on the barren who do not bear,
  And does no good for the widow.

# Job 24:22
  But God draws the mighty away with His power;
  He rises up, but no man is sure of life.

# Job 24:23
  He gives them security, and they rely on it;
  Yet His eyes are on their ways.

# Job 24:24
  They are exalted for a little while,
  Then they are gone.

  They are brought low;
  They are taken out of the way like all others;
  They dry out like the heads of grain.

# Job 24:25
  Now if it is not so, who will prove me a liar,
  And make my speech worth nothing?
}

# Job 25:1
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:
{
# Job 25:2
  Dominion and fear belong to Him;
  He makes peace in His high places.

# Job 25:3
  Is there any number to His armies?

  Upon whom does His light not rise?

# Job 25:4
  How then can man be righteous before God?

  Or how can he be pure who is born of a woman?

# Job 25:5
  If even the moon does not shine,
  And the stars are not pure in His sight,
# Job 25:6
  How much less man, who is a maggot,
  And a son of man, who is a worm?
}

# Job 26:1
But Job answered and said:
{
# Job 26:2
  How have you helped him who is without power?

  How have you saved the arm that has no strength?

# Job 26:3
  How have you counseled one who has no wisdom?

  And how have you declared sound advice to many?

# Job 26:4
  To whom have you uttered words?

  And whose spirit came from you?

# Job 26:5
  The dead tremble,
  Those under the waters and those inhabiting them.

# Job 26:6
  Sheol is naked before Him,
  And Destruction has no covering.

# Job 26:7
  He stretches out the north over empty space;
  He hangs the earth on nothing.

# Job 26:8
  He binds up the water in His thick clouds,
  Yet the clouds are not broken under it.

# Job 26:9
  He covers the face of His throne,
  And spreads His cloud over it.

# Job 26:10
  He drew a circular horizon on the face of the waters,
  At the boundary of light and darkness.

# Job 26:11
  The pillars of heaven tremble,
  And are astonished at His rebuke.

# Job 26:12
  He stirs up the sea with His power,
  And by His understanding He breaks up the storm.

# Job 26:13
  By His Spirit He adorned the heavens;
  His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.

# Job 26:14
  Indeed these are the mere edges of His ways,
  And how small a whisper we hear of Him!

  But the thunder of His power who can understand?
}

# Job 27:1
Moreover Job continued his discourse, and said:
{
# Job 27:2
  As God lives, who has taken away my justice,
  And the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,

# Job 27:3
  As long as my breath is in me,
  And the breath of God in my nostrils,

# Job 27:4
  My lips will not speak wickedness,
  Nor my tongue utter deceit.

# Job 27:5
  Far be it from me
  That I should say you are right;
  Till I die I will not put away my integrity from me.

# Job 27:6
  My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go;
  My heart shall not reproach me as long as I live.

# Job 27:7
  May my enemy be like the wicked,
  And he who rises up against me like the unrighteous.

# Job 27:8
  For what is the hope of the hypocrite,
  Though he may gain much,
  If God takes away his life?

# Job 27:9
  Will God hear his cry
  When trouble comes upon him?

# Job 27:10
  Will he delight himself in the Almighty?

  Will he always call on God?

# Job 27:11
  I will teach you about the hand of God;
  What is with the Almighty I will not conceal.

# Job 27:12
  Surely all of you have seen it;
  Why then do you behave with complete nonsense?

# Job 27:13
  This is the portion of a wicked man with God,
  And the heritage of oppressors, received from the Almighty:

# Job 27:14
  If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword;
  And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

# Job 27:15
  Those who survive him shall be buried in death,
  And their widows shall not weep,

# Job 27:16
  Though he heaps up silver like dust,
  And piles up clothing like clay --

# Job 27:17
  He may pile it up, but the just will wear it,
  And the innocent will divide the silver.

# Job 27:18
  He builds his house like a moth,
  Like a booth which a watchman makes.

# Job 27:19
  The rich man will lie down,
  But not be gathered up;
  He opens his eyes,
  And he is no more.

# Job 27:20
  Terrors overtake him like a flood;
  A tempest steals him away in the night.

# Job 27:21
  The east wind carries him away, and he is gone;
  It sweeps him out of his place.

# Job 27:22
  It hurls against him and does not spare;
  He flees desperately from its power.

# Job 27:23
  Men shall clap their hands at him,
  And shall hiss him out of his place.

# Job 28:1
  Surely there is a mine for silver,
  And a place where gold is refined.

# Job 28:2
  Iron is taken from the earth,
  And copper is smelted from ore.

# Job 28:3
  Man puts an end to darkness,
  And searches every recess
  For ore in the darkness and the shadow of death.

# Job 28:4
  He breaks open a shaft away from people;
  In places forgotten by feet
  They hang far away from men;
  They swing to and fro.

# Job 28:5
  As for the earth, from it comes bread,
  But underneath it is turned up as by fire;
# Job 28:6
  Its stones are the source of sapphires,
  And it contains gold dust.

# Job 28:7
  That path no bird knows,
  Nor has the falcon's eye seen it.

# Job 28:8
  The proud lions have not trodden it,
  Nor has the fierce lion passed over it.

# Job 28:9
  He puts his hand on the flint;
  He overturns the mountains at the roots.

# Job 28:10
  He cuts out channels in the rocks,
  And his eye sees every precious thing.

# Job 28:11
  He dams up the streams from trickling;
  What is hidden he brings forth to light.

# Job 28:12
  But where can wisdom be found?

  And where is the place of understanding?

# Job 28:13
  Man does not know its value,
  Nor is it found in the land of the living.

# Job 28:14
  The deep says, "It is not in me";
  And the sea says, "It is not with me."

# Job 28:15
  It cannot be purchased for gold,
  Nor can silver be weighed for its price.

# Job 28:16
  It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir,
  In precious onyx or sapphire.

# Job 28:17
  Neither gold nor crystal can equal it,
  Nor can it be exchanged for jewelry of fine gold.

# Job 28:18
  No mention shall be made of coral or quartz,
  For the price of wisdom is above rubies.

# Job 28:19
  The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it,
  Nor can it be valued in pure gold.

# Job 28:20
  From where then does wisdom come?

  And where is the place of understanding?

# Job 28:21
  It is hidden from the eyes of all living,
  And concealed from the birds of the air.

# Job 28:22
  Destruction and Death say,
  {
    We have heard a report about it with our ears.
  }

# Job 28:23
  God understands its way,
  And He knows its place.

# Job 28:24
  For He looks to the ends of the earth,
  And sees under the whole heavens,
# Job 28:25
  To establish a weight for the wind,
  And apportion the waters by measure.

# Job 28:26
  When He made a law for the rain,
  And a path for the thunderbolt,
# Job 28:27
  Then He saw wisdom and declared it;
  He prepared it, indeed, He searched it out.

# Job 28:28
  And to man He said,
  {
    Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom,
    And to depart from evil is understanding.
  }
}

# Job 29:1
Job further continued his discourse, and said:
{
# Job 29:2
  Oh, that I were as in months past,
  As in the days when God watched over me;

# Job 29:3
  When His lamp shone upon my head,
  And when by His light I walked through darkness;

# Job 29:4
  Just as I was in the days of my prime,
  When the friendly counsel of God was over my tent;

# Job 29:5
  When the Almighty was yet with me,
  When my children were around me;

# Job 29:6
  When my steps were bathed with cream,
  And the rock poured out rivers of oil for me!

# Job 29:7
  When I went out to the gate by the city,
  When I took my seat in the open square,

# Job 29:8
  The young men saw me and hid,
  And the aged arose and stood;

# Job 29:9
  The princes refrained from talking,
  And put their hand on their mouth;

# Job 29:10
  The voice of nobles was hushed,
  And their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.

# Job 29:11
  When the ear heard, then it blessed me,
  And when the eye saw, then it approved me;

# Job 29:12
  Because I delivered the poor who cried out,
  The fatherless and the one who had no helper.

# Job 29:13
  The blessing of a perishing man came upon me,
  And I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

# Job 29:14
  I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;
  My justice was like a robe and a turban.

# Job 29:15
  I was eyes to the blind,
  And I was feet to the lame.

# Job 29:16
  I was a father to the poor,
  And I searched out the case that I did not know.

# Job 29:17
  I broke the fangs of the wicked,
  And plucked the victim from his teeth.

# Job 29:18
  Then I said,
  {
    I shall die in my nest,
    And multiply my days as the sand.

# Job 29:19
    My root is spread out to the waters,
    And the dew lies all night on my branch.

# Job 29:20
    My glory is fresh within me,
    And my bow is renewed in my hand.
  }

# Job 29:21
  Men listened to me and waited,
  And kept silence for my counsel.

# Job 29:22
  After my words they did not speak again,
  And my speech settled on them as dew.

# Job 29:23
  They waited for me as for the rain,
  And they opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain.

# Job 29:24
  If I mocked at them, they did not believe it,
  And the light of my countenance they did not cast down.

# Job 29:25
  I chose the way for them, and sat as chief;
  So I dwelt as a king in the army,
  As one who comforts mourners.

# Job 30:1
  But now they mock at me, men younger than I,
  Whose fathers I disdained to put with the dogs of my flock.

# Job 30:2
  Indeed, what profit is the strength of their hands to me?

  Their vigor has perished.

# Job 30:3
  They are gaunt from want and famine,
  Fleeing late to the wilderness, desolate and waste,

# Job 30:4
  Who pluck mallow by the bushes,
  And broom tree roots for their food.

# Job 30:5
  They were driven out from among men,
  They shouted at them as at a thief.

# Job 30:6
  They had to live in the clefts of the valleys,
  In caves of the earth and the rocks.

# Job 30:7
  Among the bushes they brayed,
  Under the nettles they nestled.

# Job 30:8
  They were sons of fools,
  Yes, sons of vile men;
  They were scourged from the land.

# Job 30:9
  And now I am their taunting song;
  Yes, I am their byword.

# Job 30:10
  They abhor me, they keep far from me;
  They do not hesitate to spit in my face.

# Job 30:11
  Because He has loosed my bowstring and afflicted me,
  They have cast off restraint before me.

# Job 30:12
  At my right hand the rabble arises;
  They push away my feet,
  And they raise against me their ways of destruction.

# Job 30:13
  They break up my path,
  They promote my calamity;
  They have no helper.

# Job 30:14
  They come as broad breakers;
  Under the ruinous storm they roll along.

# Job 30:15
  Terrors are turned upon me;
  They pursue my honor as the wind,
  And my prosperity has passed like a cloud.

# Job 30:16
  And now my soul is poured out because of my plight;
  The days of affliction take hold of me.

# Job 30:17
  My bones are pierced in me at night,
  And my gnawing pains take no rest.

# Job 30:18
  By great force my garment is disfigured;
  It binds me about as the collar of my coat.

# Job 30:19
  He has cast me into the mire,
  And I have become like dust and ashes.

# Job 30:20
  I cry out to You, but You do not answer me;
  I stand up, and You regard me.

# Job 30:21
  But You have become cruel to me;
  With the strength of Your hand You oppose me.

# Job 30:22
  You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride on it;
  You spoil my success.

# Job 30:23
  For I know that You will bring me to death,
  And to the house appointed for all living.

# Job 30:24
  Surely He would not stretch out His hand against a heap of ruins,
  If they cry out when He destroys it.

# Job 30:25
  Have I not wept for him who was in trouble?

  Has not my soul grieved for the poor?

# Job 30:26
  But when I looked for good, evil came to me;
  And when I waited for light, then came darkness.

# Job 30:27
  My heart is in turmoil and cannot rest;
  Days of affliction confront me.

# Job 30:28
  I go about mourning, but not in the sun;
  I stand up in the assembly and cry out for help.

# Job 30:29
  I am a brother of jackals,
  And a companion of ostriches.

# Job 30:30
  My skin grows black and falls from me;
  My bones burn with fever.

# Job 30:31
  My harp is turned to mourning,
  And my flute to the voice of those who weep.

# Job 31:1
  I have made a covenant with my eyes;
  Why then should I look upon a young woman?

# Job 31:2
  For what is the allotment of God from above,
  And the inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

# Job 31:3
  Is it not destruction for the wicked,
  And disaster for the workers of iniquity?

# Job 31:4
  Does He not see my ways,
  And count all my steps?

# Job 31:5
  If I have walked with falsehood,
  Or if my foot has hastened to deceit,

# Job 31:6
  Let me be weighed on honest scales,
  That God may know my integrity.

# Job 31:7
  If my step has turned from the way,
  Or my heart walked after my eyes,
  Or if any spot adheres to my hands,

# Job 31:8
  Then let me sow, and another eat;
  Yes, let my harvest be rooted out.

# Job 31:9
  If my heart has been enticed by a woman,
  Or if I have lurked at my neighbor's door,

# Job 31:10
  Then let my wife grind for another,
  And let others bow down over her.

# Job 31:11
  For that would be wickedness;
  Yes, it would be iniquity deserving of judgment.

# Job 31:12
  For that would be a fire that consumes to destruction,
  And would root out all my increase.

# Job 31:13
  If I have despised the cause of my male or female servant
  When they complained against me,

# Job 31:14
  What then shall I do when God rises up?

  When He punishes, how shall I answer Him?

# Job 31:15
  Did not He who made me in the womb make them?

  Did not the same One fashion us in the womb?

# Job 31:16
  If I have kept the poor from their desire,
  Or caused the eyes of the widow to fail,

# Job 31:17
  Or eaten my morsel by myself,
  So that the fatherless could not eat of it

# Job 31:18
  (But from my youth I reared him as a father,
  And from my mother's womb I guided the widow);

# Job 31:19
  If I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing,
  Or any poor man without covering;

# Job 31:20
  If his heart has not blessed me,
  And if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;

# Job 31:21
  If I have raised my hand against the fatherless,
  When I saw I had help in the gate;

# Job 31:22
  Then let my arm fall from my shoulder,
  Let my arm be torn from the socket.

# Job 31:23
  For destruction from God is a terror to me,
  And because of His magnificence I cannot endure.

# Job 31:24
  If I have made gold my hope,
  Or said to fine gold, "You are my confidence";

# Job 31:25
  If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,
  And because my hand had gained much;

# Job 31:26
  If I have observed the sun when it shines,
  Or the moon moving in brightness,

# Job 31:27
  So that my heart has been secretly enticed,
  And my mouth has kissed my hand;

# Job 31:28
  This also would be an iniquity deserving of judgment,
  For I would have denied God who is above.

# Job 31:29
  If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me,
  Or lifted myself up when evil found him

# Job 31:30
  (Indeed I have not allowed my mouth to sin
  By asking for a curse on his soul);

# Job 31:31
  If the men of my tent have not said,
  "Who is there that has not been satisfied with his meat?"

# Job 31:32
  (But no sojourner had to lodge in the street,
  For I have opened my doors to the traveler);

# Job 31:33
  If I have covered my transgressions as Adam,
  By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,

# Job 31:34
  Because I feared the great multitude,
  And dreaded the contempt of families,
  So that I kept silence
  And did not go out of the door --

# Job 31:35
  Oh, that I had one to hear me!

  Here is my mark.

  Oh, that the Almighty would answer me,
  That my Prosecutor had written a book!

# Job 31:36
  Surely I would carry it on my shoulder,
  And bind it on me like a crown;

# Job 31:37
  I would declare to Him the number of my steps;
  Like a prince I would approach Him.

# Job 31:38
  If my land cries out against me,
  And its furrows weep together;

# Job 31:39
  If I have eaten its fruit without money,
  Or caused its owners to lose their lives;

# Job 31:40
  Then let thistles grow instead of wheat,
  And weeds instead of barley.
}

The words of Job are ended.

# Job 32:1
So these three men ceased answering Job,
because he was righteous in his own eyes.

# Job 32:2
Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite,
of the family of Ram,
was aroused against Job;
his wrath was aroused because he justified himself rather than God.

# Job 32:3
Also against his three friends his wrath was aroused,
because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

# Job 32:4
Now because they were years older than he,
Elihu had waited to speak to Job.

# Job 32:5
When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men,
his wrath was aroused.

# Job 32:6
So Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, answered and said:
{
  I am young in years, and you are very old;
  Therefore I was afraid,
  And dared not declare my opinion to you.

# Job 32:7
  I said,
  {
    Age should speak,
    And multitude of years should teach wisdom.
  }

# Job 32:8
  But there is a spirit in man,
  And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.

# Job 32:9
  Great men are not always wise,
  Nor do the aged always understand justice.

# Job 32:10
  Therefore I say,
  {
    Listen to me, I also will declare my opinion.
  }

# Job 32:11
  Indeed I waited for your words,
  I listened to your reasonings, while you searched out what to say.

# Job 32:12
  I paid close attention to you;
  And surely not one of you convinced Job,
  Or answered his words --

# Job 32:13
  Lest you say, "We have found wisdom";
  God will vanquish him, not man.

# Job 32:14
  Now he has not directed his words against me;
  So I will not answer him with your words.

# Job 32:15
  They are dismayed and answer no more;
  Words escape them.

# Job 32:16
  And I have waited, because they did not speak,
  Because they stood still and answered no more.

# Job 32:17
  I also will answer my part,
  I too will declare my opinion.

# Job 32:18
  For I am full of words;
  The spirit within me compels me.

# Job 32:19
  Indeed my belly is like wine that has no vent;
  It is ready to burst like new wineskins.

# Job 32:20
  I will speak, that I may find relief;
  I must open my lips and answer.

# Job 32:21
  Let me not, I pray, show partiality to anyone;
  Nor let me flatter any man.

# Job 32:22
  For I do not know how to flatter,
  Else my Maker would soon take me away.

# Job 33:1
  But please, Job, hear my speech,
  And listen to all my words.

# Job 33:2
  Now, I open my mouth;
  My tongue speaks in my mouth.

# Job 33:3
  My words come from my upright heart;
  My lips utter pure knowledge.

# Job 33:4
  The Spirit of God has made me,
  And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.

# Job 33:5
  If you can answer me,
  Set your words in order before me;
  Take your stand.

# Job 33:6
  Truly I am as your spokesman before God;
  I also have been formed out of clay.

# Job 33:7
  Surely no fear of me will terrify you,
  Nor will my hand be heavy on you.

# Job 33:8
  Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
  And I have heard the sound of your words, saying,

  {
# Job 33:9
    I am pure, without transgression;
    I am innocent, and there is no iniquity in me.

# Job 33:10
    Yet He finds occasions against me,
    He counts me as His enemy;

# Job 33:11
    He puts my feet in the stocks,
    He watches all my paths.
  }

# Job 33:12
  Look, in this you are not righteous.

  I will answer you,
  For God is greater than man.

# Job 33:13
  Why do you contend with Him?

  For He does not give an accounting of any of His words.

# Job 33:14
  For God may speak in one way, or in another,
  Yet man does not perceive it.

# Job 33:15
  In a dream, in a vision of the night,
  When deep sleep falls upon men,
  While slumbering on their beds,

# Job 33:16
  Then He opens the ears of men,
  And seals their instruction.

# Job 33:17
  In order to turn man from his deed,
  And conceal pride from man,

# Job 33:18
  He keeps back his soul from the Pit,
  And his life from perishing by the sword.

# Job 33:19
  Man is also chastened with pain on his bed,
  And with strong pain in many of his bones,

# Job 33:20
  So that his life abhors bread,
  And his soul succulent food.

# Job 33:21
  His flesh wastes away from sight,
  And his bones stick out which once were not seen.

# Job 33:22
  Yes, his soul draws near the Pit,
  And his life to the executioners.

# Job 33:23
  If there is a messenger for him,
  A mediator, one among 1000,
  To show man His uprightness,
# Job 33:24
  Then He is gracious to him, and says,
  {
    Deliver him from going down to the Pit;
    I have found a ransom
  };

# Job 33:25
  His flesh shall be young like a child's,
  He shall return to the days of his youth.

# Job 33:26
  He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him,
  He shall see His face with joy,
  For He restores to man His righteousness.

# Job 33:27
  Then he looks at men and says,
  {
    I have sinned, and perverted what was right,
    And it did not profit me.
  }

# Job 33:28
  He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit,
  And his life shall see the light.

# Job 33:29
  Behold, God works all these things,
  Twice, in fact, three times with a man,

# Job 33:30
  To bring back his soul from the Pit,
  That he may be enlightened with the light of life.

# Job 33:31
  Give ear, Job, listen to me;
  Hold your peace, and I will speak.

# Job 33:32
  If you have anything to say, answer me;
  Speak, for I desire to justify you.

# Job 33:33
  If not, listen to me;
  Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.
}

# Job 34:1
Elihu further answered and said:
{
# Job 34:2
  Hear my words, you wise men;
  Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.

# Job 34:3
  For the ear tests words
  As the palate tastes food.

# Job 34:4
  Let us choose justice for ourselves;
  Let us know among ourselves what is good.

# Job 34:5
  For Job has said,
  {
    I am righteous,
    But God has taken away my justice;

# Job 34:6
    Should I lie concerning my right?

    My wound is incurable,
    though I am without transgression.
  }

# Job 34:7
  What man is like Job,
  Who drinks scorn like water,

# Job 34:8
  Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,
  And walks with wicked men?

# Job 34:9
  For he has said,
  {
    It profits a man nothing
    That he should delight in God.
  }

# Job 34:10
  Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:
  Far be it from God to do wickedness,
  And from the Almighty to commit iniquity.

# Job 34:11
  For He repays man according to his work,
  And makes man to find a reward according to his way.

# Job 34:12
  Surely God will never do wickedly,
  Nor will the Almighty pervert justice.

# Job 34:13
  Who gave Him charge over the earth?

  Or who appointed Him over the whole world?

# Job 34:14
  If He should set His heart on it,
  If He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath,

# Job 34:15
  All flesh would perish together,
  And man would return to dust.

# Job 34:16
  If you have understanding, hear this;
  Listen to the sound of my words:

# Job 34:17
  Should one who hates justice govern?

  Will you condemn Him who is most just?

# Job 34:18
  Is it fitting to say to a king, "You are worthless,"
  And to nobles, "You are wicked"?

# Job 34:19
  Yet He is not partial to princes,
  Nor does He regard the rich more than the poor;
  For they are all the work of His hands.

# Job 34:20
  In a moment they die, in the middle of the night;
  The people are shaken and pass away;
  The mighty are taken away without a hand.

# Job 34:21
  For His eyes are on the ways of man,
  And He sees all his steps.

# Job 34:22
  There is no darkness nor shadow of death
  Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.

# Job 34:23
  For He need not further consider a man,
  That he should go before God in judgment.

# Job 34:24
  He breaks in pieces mighty men without inquiry,
  And sets others in their place.

# Job 34:25
  Therefore he knows their works;
  He overthrows them in the night,
  And they are crushed.

# Job 34:26
  He strikes them as wicked men
  In the open sight of others,

# Job 34:27
  Because they turned back from Him,
  And would not consider any of His ways,

# Job 34:28
  So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him;
  For He hears the cry of the afflicted.

# Job 34:29
  When He gives quietness, who then can make trouble?

  And when He hides His face, who then can see Him,
  Whether it is against a nation or a man alone?--

# Job 34:30
  That the hypocrite should not reign,
  Lest the people be ensnared.

# Job 34:31
  For has anyone said to God,
  {
    I have borne chastening;
    I will offend no more;

# Job 34:32
    Teach me what I do not see;
    If I have done iniquity,
    I will do no more
  }?

# Job 34:33
  Should He repay it according to your terms,
  Just because you disavow it?

  You must choose, and not I;
  Therefore speak what you know.

# Job 34:34
  Men of understanding say to me,
  Wise men who listen to me:

  {
# Job 34:35
    Job speaks without knowledge,
    His words are without wisdom.
  }

# Job 34:36
  Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost,
  Because his answers are like those of wicked men!

# Job 34:37
  For he adds rebellion to his sin;
  He claps his hands among us,
  And multiplies his words against God.
}

# Job 35:1
Moreover Elihu answered and said:
{
# Job 35:2
  Do you think this is right?

  Do you say, "My righteousness is more than God's"?

# Job 35:3
  For you say,
  {
    What advantage will it be to You?

    What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?
  }

# Job 35:4
  I will answer you,
  And your companions with you.

# Job 35:5
  Look to the heavens and see;
  And behold the clouds --
  They are higher than you.

# Job 35:6
  If you sin,
  what do you accomplish against Him?

  Or,
  if your transgressions are multiplied,
  what do you do to Him?

# Job 35:7
  If you are righteous,
  what do you give Him?

  Or what does He receive from your hand?

# Job 35:8
  Your wickedness affects a man such as you,
  And your righteousness a son of man.

# Job 35:9
  Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;
  They cry out for help because of the arm of the mighty.

# Job 35:10
  But no one says,
  {
    Where is God my Maker,
    Who gives songs in the night,

# Job 35:11
    Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth,
    And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?
  }

# Job 35:12
  There they cry out, but He does not answer,
  Because of the pride of evil men.

# Job 35:13
  Surely God will not listen to empty talk,
  Nor will the Almighty regard it.

# Job 35:14
  Although you say you do not see Him,
  Yet justice is before Him, and you must wait for Him.

# Job 35:15
  And now, because He has not punished in His anger,
  Nor taken much notice of folly,

# Job 35:16
  Therefore Job opens his mouth in vain;
  He multiplies words without knowledge.
}

# Job 36:1
Elihu also proceeded and said:
{
# Job 36:2
  Bear with me a little, and I will show you
  That there are yet words to speak on God's behalf.

# Job 36:3
  I will fetch my knowledge from afar;
  I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.

# Job 36:4
  For truly my words are not false;
  One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.

# Job 36:5
  Behold, God is mighty, but despises no one;
  He is mighty in strength of understanding.

# Job 36:6
  He does not preserve the life of the wicked,
  But gives justice to the oppressed.

# Job 36:7
  He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous;
  But they are on the throne with kings,
  For He has seated them forever,
  And they are exalted.

# Job 36:8
  And if they are bound in fetters,
  Held in the cords of affliction,

# Job 36:9
  Then He tells them their work and their transgressions --
  That they have acted defiantly.

# Job 36:10
  He also opens their ear to instruction,
  And commands that they turn from iniquity.

# Job 36:11
  If they obey and serve Him,
  They shall spend their days in prosperity,
  And their years in pleasures.

# Job 36:12
  But if they do not obey,
  They shall perish by the sword,
  And they shall die without knowledge.

# Job 36:13
  But the hypocrites in heart store up wrath;
  They do not cry for help when He binds them.

# Job 36:14
  They die in youth,
  And their life ends among the perverted persons.

# Job 36:15
  He delivers the poor in their affliction,
  And opens their ears in oppression.

# Job 36:16
  Indeed He would have brought you out of dire distress,
  Into a broad place where there is no restraint;
  And what is set on your table would be full of richness.

# Job 36:17
  But you are filled with the judgment due the wicked;
  Judgment and justice take hold of you.

# Job 36:18
  Because there is wrath,
  beware lest He take you away with one blow;
  For a large ransom would not help you avoid it.

# Job 36:19
  Will your riches,
  Or all the mighty forces,
  Keep you from distress?

# Job 36:20
  Do not desire the night,
  When people are cut off in their place.

# Job 36:21
  Take heed, do not turn to iniquity,
  For you have chosen this rather than affliction.

# Job 36:22
  Behold, God is exalted by His power;
  Who teaches like Him?

# Job 36:23
  Who has assigned Him His way,
  Or who has said, "You have done wrong"?

# Job 36:24
  Remember to magnify His work,
  Of which men have sung.

# Job 36:25
  Everyone has seen it;
  Man looks on it from afar.

# Job 36:26
  Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him;
  Nor can the number of His years be discovered.

# Job 36:27
  For He draws up drops of water,
  Which distill as rain from the mist,

# Job 36:28
  Which the clouds drop down
  And pour abundantly on man.

# Job 36:29
  Indeed, can anyone understand the spreading of clouds,
  The thunder from His canopy?

# Job 36:30
  Look, He scatters his light upon it,
  And covers the depths of the sea.

# Job 36:31
  For by these He judges the peoples;
  He gives food in abundance.

# Job 36:32
  He covers His hands with lightning,
  And commands it to strike.

# Job 36:33
  His thunder declares it,
  The cattle also, concerning the rising storm.

# Job 37:1
  At this also my heart trembles,
  And leaps from its place.

# Job 37:2
  Hear attentively the thunder of His voice,
  And the rumbling that comes from His mouth.

# Job 37:3
  He sends it forth under the whole heaven,
  His lightning to the ends of the earth.

# Job 37:4
  After it a voice roars;
  He thunders with His majestic voice,
  And He does not restrain them when His voice is heard.

# Job 37:5
  God thunders marvelously with His voice;
  He does great things which we cannot comprehend.

# Job 37:6
  For He says to the snow, "Fall on the earth";
  Likewise to the gentle rain and the heavy rain of His strength.

# Job 37:7
  He seals the hand of every man,
  That all men may know His work.

# Job 37:8
  The beasts go into dens,
  And remain in their lairs.

# Job 37:9
  From the chamber of the south comes the whirlwind,
  And cold from the scattering winds of the north.

# Job 37:10
  By the breath of God ice is given,
  And the broad waters are frozen.

# Job 37:11
  Also with moisture He saturates the thick clouds;
  He scatters His bright clouds.

# Job 37:12
  And they swirl about, being turned by His guidance,
  That they may do whatever He commands them
  On the face of the whole earth.

# Job 37:13
  He causes it to come,
  Whether for correction,
  Or for His land,
  Or for mercy.

# Job 37:14
  Listen to this, O Job;
  Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.

# Job 37:15
  Do you know when God dispatches them,
  And causes the light of His cloud to shine?

# Job 37:16
  Do you know how the clouds are balanced,
  Those wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?

# Job 37:17
  Why are your garments hot,
  When He quiets the earth by the south wind?

# Job 37:18
  With Him, have you spread out the skies,
  Strong as a cast metal mirror?

# Job 37:19
  Teach us what we should say to Him,
  For we can prepare nothing because of the darkness.

# Job 37:20
  Should He be told that I wish to speak?

  If a man were to speak, surely he would be swallowed up.

# Job 37:21
  Even now men cannot look at the light when it is bright in the skies,
  When the wind has passed and cleared them.

# Job 37:22
  He comes from the north as golden splendor;
  With God is awesome majesty.

# Job 37:23
  As for the Almighty, we cannot find Him;
  He is excellent in power,
  In judgment and abundant justice;
  He does not oppress.

# Job 37:24
  Therefore men fear Him;
  He shows no partiality to any who are wise of heart.
}

# Job 38:1
Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:
{
# Job 38:2
  Who is this who darkens counsel
  By words without knowledge?

# Job 38:3
  Now prepare yourself like a man;
  I will question you, and you shall answer Me.

# Job 38:4
  Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?

  Tell Me, if you have understanding.

# Job 38:5
  Who determined its measurements?

  Surely you know!

  Or who stretched the line upon it?

# Job 38:6
  To what were its foundations fastened?

  Or who laid its cornerstone,

# Job 38:7
  When the morning stars sang together,
  And all the sons of God shouted for joy?

# Job 38:8
  Or who shut in the sea with doors,
  When it burst forth and issued from the womb;

# Job 38:9
  When I made the clouds its garment,
  And thick darkness its swaddling band;

# Job 38:10
  When I fixed My limit for it,
  And set bars and doors;

# Job 38:11
  When I said,
  {
    This far you may come, but no farther,
    And here your proud waves must stop!
  }

# Job 38:12
  Have you commanded the morning since your days began,
  And caused the dawn to know its place,

# Job 38:13
  That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
  And the wicked be shaken out of it?

# Job 38:14
  It takes on form like clay under a seal,
  And stands out like a garment.

# Job 38:15
  From the wicked their light is withheld,
  And the upraised arm is broken.

# Job 38:16
  Have you entered the springs of the sea?

  Or have you walked in search of the depths?

# Job 38:17
  Have the gates of death been revealed to you?

  Or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death?

# Job 38:18
  Have you comprehended the breadth of the earth?

  Tell Me, if you know all this.

# Job 38:19
  Where is the way to the dwelling of light?

  And darkness, where is its place,

# Job 38:20
  That you may take it to its territory,
  That you may know the paths to its home?

# Job 38:21
  Do you know it, because you were born then,
  Or because the number of your days is great?

# Job 38:22
  Have you entered the treasury of snow,
  Or have you seen the treasury of hail,

# Job 38:23
  Which I have reserved for the time of trouble,
  For the day of battle and war?

# Job 38:24
  By what way is light diffused,
  Or the east wind scattered over the earth?

# Job 38:25
  Who has divided a channel for the overflowing water,
  Or a path for the thunderbolt,

# Job 38:26
  To cause it to rain on a land where there is no one,
  A wilderness in which there is no man;

# Job 38:27
  To satisfy the desolate waste,
  And cause to spring forth the growth of tender grass?

# Job 38:28
  Has the rain a father?

  Or who has begotten the drops of dew?

# Job 38:29
  From whose womb comes the ice?

  And the frost of heaven, who gives it birth?

# Job 38:30
  The waters harden like stone,
  And the surface of the deep is frozen.

# Job 38:31
  Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades,
  Or loose the belt of Orion?

# Job 38:32
  Can you bring out Mazzaroth in its season?

  Or can you guide the Great Bear with its cubs?

# Job 38:33
  Do you know the ordinances of the heavens?

  Can you set their dominion over the earth?

# Job 38:34
  Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,
  That an abundance of water may cover you?

# Job 38:35
  Can you send out lightnings, that they may go,
  And say to you, "Here we are!"?

# Job 38:36
  Who has put wisdom in the mind?

  Or who has given understanding to the heart?

# Job 38:37
  Who can number the clouds by wisdom?

  Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,

# Job 38:38
  When the dust hardens in clumps,
  And the clods cling together?

# Job 38:39
  Can you hunt the prey for the lion,
  Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,

# Job 38:40
  When they crouch in their dens,
  Or lurk in their lairs to lie in wait?

# Job 38:41
  Who provides food for the raven,
  When its young ones cry to God,
  And wander about for lack of food?

# Job 39:1
  Do you know the time when the wild mountain goats bear young?

  Or can you mark when the deer gives birth?

# Job 39:2
  Can you number the months that they fulfill?

  Or do you know the time when they bear young?

# Job 39:3
  They bow down,
  They bring forth their young,
  They deliver their offspring.

# Job 39:4
  Their young ones are healthy,
  They grow strong with grain;
  They depart and do not return to them.

# Job 39:5
  Who set the wild donkey free?

  Who loosed the bonds of the onager,

# Job 39:6
  Whose home I have made the wilderness,
  And the barren land his dwelling?

# Job 39:7
  He scorns the tumult of the city;
  He does not heed the shouts of the driver.

# Job 39:8
  The range of the mountains is his pasture,
  And he searches after every green thing.

# Job 39:9
  Will the wild ox be willing to serve you?

  Will he bed by your manger?

# Job 39:10
  Can you bind the wild ox in the furrow with ropes?

  Or will he plow the valleys behind you?

# Job 39:11
  Will you trust him because his strength is great?

  Or will you leave your labor to him?

# Job 39:12
  Will you trust him to bring home your grain,
  And gather it to your threshing floor?

# Job 39:13
  The wings of the ostrich wave proudly,
  But are her wings and pinions like the kindly stork's?

# Job 39:14
  For she leaves her eggs on the ground,
  And warms them in the dust;

# Job 39:15
  She forgets that a foot may crush them,
  Or that a wild beast may break them.

# Job 39:16
  She treats her young harshly, as though they were not hers;
  Her labor is in vain, without concern,

# Job 39:17
  Because God deprived her of wisdom,
  And did not endow her with understanding.

# Job 39:18
  When she lifts herself on high,
  She scorns the horse and its rider.

# Job 39:19
  Have you given the horse strength?

  Have you clothed his neck with thunder?

# Job 39:20
  Can you frighten him like a locust?

  His majestic snorting strikes terror.

# Job 39:21
  He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength;
  He gallops into the clash of arms.

# Job 39:22
  He mocks at fear, and is not frightened;
  Nor does he turn back from the sword.

# Job 39:23
  The quiver rattles against him,
  The glittering spear and javelin.

# Job 39:24
  He devours the distance with fierceness and rage;
  Nor does he come to a halt because the trumpet has sounded.

# Job 39:25
  At the blast of the trumpet he says, "Aha!"
  He smells the battle from afar,
  The thunder of captains and shouting.

# Job 39:26
  Does the hawk fly by your wisdom,
  And spread its wings toward the south?

# Job 39:27
  Does the eagle mount up at your command,
  And make its nest on high?

# Job 39:28
  On the rocks it dwells and resides,
  On the crag of the rock and the stronghold.

# Job 39:29
  From there it spies out the prey;
  Its eyes observe from afar.

# Job 39:30
  Its young ones suck up blood;
  And where the slain are, there it is.
}

# Job 40:1
Moreover the Lord answered Job, and said:
{
# Job 40:2
  Shall the one who contends with the Almighty correct Him?

  He who rebukes God, let him answer it.
}

# Job 40:3
Then Job answered the Lord and said:
{
# Job 40:4
  Behold, I am vile;
  What shall I answer You?

  I lay my hand over my mouth.

# Job 40:5
  Once I have spoken, but I will not answer;
  Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.
}

# Job 40:6
Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:
{
# Job 40:7
  Now prepare yourself like a man;
  I will question you, and you shall answer Me:

# Job 40:8
  Would you indeed annul My judgment?

  Would you condemn Me that you may be justified?

# Job 40:9
  Have you an arm like God?

  Or can you thunder with a voice like His?

# Job 40:10
  Then adorn yourself with majesty and splendor,
  And array yourself with glory and beauty.

# Job 40:11
  Disperse the rage of your wrath;
  Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him.

# Job 40:12
  Look on everyone who is proud, and bring him low;
  Tread down the wicked in their place.

# Job 40:13
  Hide them in the dust together,
  Bind their faces in hidden darkness.

# Job 40:14
  Then I will also confess to you
  That your own right hand can save you.

# Job 40:15
  Look now at the behemoth, which I made along with you;
  He eats grass like an ox.

# Job 40:16
  See now, his strength is in his hips,
  And his power is in his stomach muscles.

# Job 40:17
  He moves his tail like a cedar;
  The sinews of his thighs are tightly knit.

# Job 40:18
  His bones are like beams of bronze,
  His ribs like bars of iron.

# Job 40:19
  He is the first of the ways of God;
  Only He who made him can bring near His sword.

# Job 40:20
  Surely the mountains yield food for him,
  And all the beasts of the field play there.

# Job 40:21
  He lies under the lotus trees,
  In a covert of reeds and marsh.

# Job 40:22
  The lotus trees cover him with their shade;
  The willows by the brook surround him.

# Job 40:23
  Indeed the river may rage,
  Yet he is not disturbed;
  He is confident, though the Jordan gushes into his mouth,

# Job 40:24
  Though he takes it in his eyes,
  Or one pierces his nose with a snare.

# Job 41:1
  Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook,
  Or snare his tongue with a line which you lower?

# Job 41:2
  Can you put a reed through his nose,
  Or pierce his jaw with a hook?

# Job 41:3
  Will he make many supplications to you?

  Will he speak softly to you?

# Job 41:4
  Will he make a covenant with you?

  Will you take him as a servant forever?

# Job 41:5
  Will you play with him as with a bird,
  Or will you leash him for your maidens?

# Job 41:6
  Will your companions make a banquet of him?

  Will they apportion him among the merchants?

# Job 41:7
  Can you fill his skin with harpoons,
  Or his head with fishing spears?

# Job 41:8
  Lay your hand on him;
  Remember the battle --
  Never do it again!

# Job 41:9
  Indeed, any hope of overcoming him is false;
  Shall one not be overwhelmed at the sight of him?

# Job 41:10
  No one is so fierce that he would dare stir him up.

  Who then is able to stand against Me?

# Job 41:11
  Who has preceded Me, that I should pay him?

  Everything under heaven is Mine.

# Job 41:12
  I will not conceal his limbs,
  His mighty power, or his graceful proportions.

# Job 41:13
  Who can remove his outer coat?

  Who can approach him with a double bridle?

# Job 41:14
  Who can open the doors of his face,
  With his terrible teeth all around?

# Job 41:15
  His rows of scales are his pride,
  Shut up tightly as with a seal;

# Job 41:16
  One is so near another
  That no air can come between them;

# Job 41:17
  They are joined one to another,
  They stick together and cannot be parted.

# Job 41:18
  His sneezings flash forth light,
  And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.

# Job 41:19
  Out of his mouth go burning lights;
  Sparks of fire shoot out.

# Job 41:20
  Smoke goes out of his nostrils,
  As from a boiling pot and burning rushes.

# Job 41:21
  His breath kindles coals,
  And a flame goes out of his mouth.

# Job 41:22
  Strength dwells in his neck,
  And sorrow dances before him.

# Job 41:23
  The folds of his flesh are joined together;
  They are firm on him and cannot be moved.

# Job 41:24
  His heart is as hard as stone,
  Even as hard as the lower millstone.

# Job 41:25
  When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid;
  Because of his crashings they are beside themselves.

# Job 41:26
  Though the sword reaches him, it cannot avail;
  Nor does spear, dart, or javelin.

# Job 41:27
  He regards iron as straw,
  And bronze as rotten wood.

# Job 41:28
  The arrow cannot make him flee;
  Slingstones become like stubble to him.

# Job 41:29
  Darts are regarded as straw;
  He laughs at the threat of javelins.

# Job 41:30
  His undersides are like sharp potsherds;
  He spreads pointed marks in the mire.

# Job 41:31
  He makes the deep boil like a pot;
  He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.

# Job 41:32
  He leaves a shining wake behind him;
  One would think the deep had white hair.

# Job 41:33
  On earth there is nothing like him,
  Which is made without fear.

# Job 41:34
  He beholds every high thing;
  He is king over all the children of pride.
}

# Job 42:1
Then Job answered the Lord and said:
{
# Job 42:2
  I know that You can do everything,
  And that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You.

# Job 42:3
  You asked,
  {
    Who is this who hides counsel without knowledge?
  }

  Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand,
  Things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.

# Job 42:4
  Listen, please, and let me speak;
  You said, "I will question you, and you shall answer Me."

# Job 42:5
  I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear,
  But now my eye sees You.

# Job 42:6
  Therefore I abhor myself,
  And repent in dust and ashes.
}

# Job 42:7
And so it was, after the Lord had spoken these words to Job,
that the Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite,
{
  My wrath is aroused against you and your two friends,
  for you have not spoken of Me what is right,
  as My servant Job has.

# Job 42:8
  Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams,
  go to My servant Job,
  and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering;
  and My servant Job shall pray for you.

  For I will accept him,
  lest I deal with you according to your folly;
  because you have not spoken of Me what is right,
  as My servant Job has.
}

# Job 42:9
So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite
went and did as the Lord commanded them;
for the Lord had accepted Job.

# Job 42:10
And the Lord restored Job's losses when he prayed for his friends.

Indeed the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before.

# Job 42:11
Then all his brothers,
all his sisters,
and all those who had been his acquaintances before,
came to him and ate food with him in his house;
and they consoled him and comforted him
for all the adversity that the Lord had brought upon him.

Each one gave him a piece of silver and each a ring of gold.

# Job 42:12
Now the Lord blessed the latter days of Job
more than his beginning;
for he had 14,000 sheep,
6,000 camels,
1,000 yoke of oxen,
and 1,000 female donkeys.

# Job 42:13
He also had seven sons and three daughters.

# Job 42:14
And he called the name of the first Jemimah,
the name of the second Keziah,
and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.

# Job 42:15
In all the land were found no women so beautiful
as the daughters of Job;
and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.

# Job 42:16
After this Job lived 140 years,
and saw his children and grandchildren for four generations.

# Job 42:17
So Job died, old and full of days.
