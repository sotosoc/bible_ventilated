# Luke 1:1
Inasmuch as many have taken in hand
to set in order a narrative of those things
which have been fulfilled among us,
# Luke 1:2
just as those who from the beginning
were eyewitnesses and ministers
of the word delivered them to us,
# Luke 1:3
it seemed good to me also,
having had perfect understanding of all things
from the very first,
to write to you an orderly account,
most excellent Theophilus,
# Luke 1:4
that you may know the certainty of those things
in which you were instructed.

# Luke 1:5
There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea,
a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah.

His wife was of the daughters of Aaron,
and her name was Elizabeth.

# Luke 1:6
And they were both righteous before God,
walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord
blameless.

# Luke 1:7
But they had no child,
because Elizabeth was barren,
and they were both well advanced in years.

# Luke 1:8
So it was,
that while he was serving as priest before God
in the order of his division,
# Luke 1:9
according to the custom of the priesthood,
his lot fell to burn incense
when he went into the temple of the Lord.

# Luke 1:10
And the whole multitude of the people was praying outside
at the hour of incense.

# Luke 1:11
Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him,
standing on the right side of the altar of incense.

# Luke 1:12
And when Zacharias saw him,
he was troubled,
and fear fell upon him.

# Luke 1:13
But the angel said to him,
{
  Do not be afraid, Zacharias,
  for your prayer is heard;
  and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,
  and you shall call his name John.

# Luke 1:14
  And you will have joy and gladness,
  and many will rejoice at his birth.

# Luke 1:15
  For he will be great in the sight of the Lord,
  and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink.

  He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit,
  even from his mother's womb.

# Luke 1:16
  And he will turn many of the children of Israel
  to the Lord their God.

# Luke 1:17
  He will also go before Him
  in the spirit and power of Elijah,
  {
    to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,
  }
  and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just,
  to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
}

# Luke 1:18
And Zacharias said to the angel,
{
  How shall I know this?

  For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.
}

# Luke 1:19
And the angel answered and said to him,
{
  I am Gabriel,
  who stands in the presence of God,
  and was sent to speak to you
  and bring you these glad tidings.

# Luke 1:20
  But behold,
  you will be mute and not able to speak
  until the day these things take place,
  because you did not believe my words
  which will be fulfilled in their own time.
}

# Luke 1:21
And the people waited for Zacharias,
and marveled that he lingered so long in the temple.

# Luke 1:22
But when he came out, he could not speak to them;
and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple,
for he beckoned to them and remained speechless.

# Luke 1:23
And so it was,
as soon as the days of his service were completed,
that he departed to his own house.

# Luke 1:24
Now after those days his wife Elizabeth conceived;
and she hid herself five months,
saying,
{
# Luke 1:25
  Thus the Lord has dealt with me,
  in the days when He looked on me,
  to take away my reproach among people.
}

# Luke 1:26
Now in the sixth month
the angel Gabriel was sent by God
to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,
# Luke 1:27
to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph,
of the house of David.

The virgin's name was Mary.

# Luke 1:28
And having come in, the angel said to her,
{
  Rejoice, highly favored one, the Lord is with you;
  blessed are you among women!
}

# Luke 1:29
But when she saw him,
she was troubled at his saying,
and considered what manner of greeting this was.

# Luke 1:30
Then the angel said to her,
{
  Do not be afraid, Mary,
  for you have found favor with God.

# Luke 1:31
  And behold,
  you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son,
  and shall call His name Jesus.

# Luke 1:32
  He will be great,
  and will be called the Son of the Highest;
  and the Lord God will give Him
  the throne of His father David.

# Luke 1:33
  And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever,
  and of His kingdom there will be no end.
}

# Luke 1:34
Then Mary said to the angel,
{
  How can this be, since I do not know a man?
}

# Luke 1:35
And the angel answered and said to her,
{
  The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
  and the power of the Highest will overshadow you;
  therefore, also,
  that Holy One who is to be born
  will be called the Son of God.

# Luke 1:36
  Now indeed,
  Elizabeth your relative
  has also conceived a son in her old age;
  and this is now the sixth month
  for her who was called barren.

# Luke 1:37
  For with God nothing will be impossible.
}

# Luke 1:38
Then Mary said,
{
  Behold the maidservant of the Lord!

  Let it be to me according to your word.
}

And the angel departed from her.

# Luke 1:39
Now Mary arose in those days
and went into the hill country with haste,
to a city of Judah,
# Luke 1:40
and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.

# Luke 1:41
And it happened,
when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary,
that the babe leaped in her womb;
and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

# Luke 1:42
Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said,
{
  Blessed are you among women,
  and blessed is the fruit of your womb!

# Luke 1:43
  But why is this granted to me,
  that the mother of my Lord should come to me?

# Luke 1:44
  For indeed,
  as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears,
  the babe leaped in my womb for joy.

# Luke 1:45
  Blessed is she who believed,
  for there will be a fulfillment of those things
  which were told her from the Lord.
}

# Luke 1:46
And Mary said:
{
  My soul magnifies the Lord,

# Luke 1:47
  And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.

# Luke 1:48
  For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant;
  For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.

# Luke 1:49
  For He who is mighty has done great things for me,
  And holy is His name.

# Luke 1:50
  And His mercy is on those who fear Him
  From generation to generation.

# Luke 1:51
  He has shown strength with His arm;
  He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.

# Luke 1:52
  He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
  And exalted the lowly.

# Luke 1:53
  He has filled the hungry with good things,
  And the rich He has sent away empty.

# Luke 1:54
  He has helped His servant Israel,
  In remembrance of His mercy,

# Luke 1:55
  As He spoke to our fathers,
  To Abraham and to his seed forever.
}

# Luke 1:56
And Mary remained with her about three months,
and returned to her house.

# Luke 1:57
Now Elizabeth's full time came for her to be delivered,
and she brought forth a son.

# Luke 1:58
When her neighbors and relatives
heard how the Lord had shown great mercy to her,
they rejoiced with her.

# Luke 1:59
So it was, on the eighth day,
that they came to circumcise the child;
and they would have called him
by the name of his father, Zacharias.

# Luke 1:60
His mother answered and said,
{
  No; he shall be called John.
}

# Luke 1:61
But they said to her,
{
  There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.
}

# Luke 1:62
So they made signs to his father --
what he would have him called.

# Luke 1:63
And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote,
saying,
{
  His name is John.
}

So they all marveled.

# Luke 1:64
Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed,
and he spoke, praising God.

# Luke 1:65
Then fear came on all who dwelt around them;
and all these sayings were discussed
throughout all the hill country of Judea.

# Luke 1:66
And all those who heard them kept them in their hearts, saying,
{
  What kind of child will this be?
}

And the hand of the Lord was with him.

# Luke 1:67
Now his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit,
and prophesied, saying:
{
# Luke 1:68
  Blessed is the Lord God of Israel,
  For He has visited and redeemed His people,

# Luke 1:69
  And has raised up a horn of salvation for us
  In the house of His servant David,

# Luke 1:70
  As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets,
  Who have been since the world began,

# Luke 1:71
  That we should be saved from our enemies
  And from the hand of all who hate us,

# Luke 1:72
  To perform the mercy promised to our fathers
  And to remember His holy covenant,

# Luke 1:73
  The oath which He swore to our father Abraham:

# Luke 1:74
  To grant us that we,
  Being delivered from the hand of our enemies,
  Might serve Him without fear,
# Luke 1:75
  In holiness and righteousness
    before Him all the days of our life.

# Luke 1:76
  And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest;
  For you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,
# Luke 1:77
  To give knowledge of salvation to His people
  By the remission of their sins,
# Luke 1:78
  Through the tender mercy of our God,
  With which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;
# Luke 1:79
  To give light
    to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death,
  To guide our feet into the way of peace.
}

# Luke 1:80
So the child grew and became strong in spirit,
and was in the deserts
till the day of his manifestation to Israel.

# Luke 2:1
And it came to pass in those days
that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus
that all the world should be registered.

# Luke 2:2
This census first took place while Quirinius was governing Syria.

# Luke 2:3
So all went to be registered,
everyone to his own city.

# Luke 2:4
Joseph also went up from Galilee,
out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judea,
to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
because he was of the house and lineage of David,
# Luke 2:5
to be registered with Mary,
his betrothed wife,
who was with child.

# Luke 2:6
So it was, that while they were there,
the days were completed for her to be delivered.

# Luke 2:7
And she brought forth her firstborn Son,
and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths,
and laid Him in a manger,
because there was no room for them in the inn.

# Luke 2:8
Now there were in the same country
shepherds living out in the fields,
keeping watch over their flock by night.

# Luke 2:9
And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them,
and the glory of the Lord shone around them,
and they were greatly afraid.

# Luke 2:10
Then the angel said to them,
{
  Do not be afraid,
  for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy
  which will be to all people.

# Luke 2:11
  For there is born to you this day
  in the city of David
  a Savior,
  who is Christ the Lord.

# Luke 2:12
  And this will be the sign to you:
  You will find a Babe wrapped in swaddling cloths,
  lying in a manger.
}

# Luke 2:13
And suddenly there was with the angel
a multitude of the heavenly host praising God
and saying:
{
# Luke 2:14
  Glory to God in the highest,
  And on earth peace, goodwill toward men!
}

# Luke 2:15
So it was,
when the angels had gone away
from them
into heaven,
that the shepherds said to one another,
{
  Let us now go to Bethlehem
  and see this thing that has come to pass,
  which the Lord has made known to us.
}

# Luke 2:16
And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph,
and the Babe lying in a manger.

# Luke 2:17
Now when they had seen Him,
they made widely known the saying
which was told them concerning this Child.

# Luke 2:18
And all those who heard it marveled
at those things which were told them by the shepherds.

# Luke 2:19
But Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart.

# Luke 2:20
Then the shepherds returned,
glorifying and praising God
for all the things that they had heard and seen,
as it was told them.

# Luke 2:21
And when 8 days were completed
for the circumcision of the Child,
His name was called Jesus,
the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.

# Luke 2:22
Now when the days of her purification
according to the law of Moses were completed,
they brought Him to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord

# Luke 2:23
(as it is written in the law of the Lord,
{
  Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord
}
),
# Luke 2:24
and to offer a sacrifice
according to what is said in the law of the Lord,
{
  A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.
}

# Luke 2:25
And behold,
there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon,
and this man was just and devout,
waiting for the Consolation of Israel,
and the Holy Spirit was upon him.

# Luke 2:26
And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ.

# Luke 2:27
So he came by the Spirit into the temple.

# Luke 2:28
And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus,
to do for Him according to the custom of the law,
# Luke 2:29
he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:
{
# Luke 2:30
  Lord, now You are letting Your servant depart in peace,
  According to Your word;
# Luke 2:31
  For my eyes have seen Your salvation
# Luke 2:32
  Which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,
# Luke 2:33
  A light to bring revelation to the Gentiles,
  And the glory of Your people Israel.
}

# Luke 2:34
And Joseph and His mother marveled at those things
which were spoken of Him.

# Luke 2:35
Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother,
{
  Behold,
  this Child is destined
  for the fall and rising of many in Israel,
  and for a sign which will be spoken against
# Luke 2:36
  (yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also),
  that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
}

# Luke 2:37
Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess,
the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher.

She was of a great age,
and had lived with a husband seven years
from her virginity;
# Luke 2:38
and this woman was a widow of about 84 years,
who did not depart from the temple,
but served God with fastings and prayers
night and day.

# Luke 2:39
And coming in that instant
she gave thanks to the Lord,
and spoke of Him to all those
who looked for redemption in Jerusalem.

# Luke 2:40
So when they had performed all things
according to the law of the Lord,
they returned to Galilee,
to their own city, Nazareth.

# Luke 2:41
And the Child grew and became strong in spirit,
filled with wisdom;
and the grace of God was upon Him.

# Luke 2:42
His parents went to Jerusalem every year
at the Feast of the Passover.

# Luke 2:43
And when He was 12 years old,
they went up to Jerusalem
according to the custom of the feast.

# Luke 2:44
When they had finished the days,
as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem.

And Joseph and His mother did not know it;
# Luke 2:45
but supposing Him to have been in the company,
they went a day's journey,
and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances.

# Luke 2:46
So when they did not find Him,
they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.

# Luke 2:47
Now so it was that after three days
they found Him in the temple,
sitting in the midst of the teachers,
both listening to them
and asking them questions.

# Luke 2:48
And all who heard Him were astonished
at His understanding and answers.

# Luke 2:49
So when they saw Him, they were amazed;
and His mother said to Him,
{
  Son, why have You done this to us?

  Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously.
}

# Luke 2:50
And He said to them,
{
  Why did you seek Me?

  Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?
}

# Luke 2:51
But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.

# Luke 2:52
Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth,
and was subject to them,
but His mother kept all these things in her heart.

# Luke 2:53
And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature,
and in favor with God and men.

# Luke 3:1
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,
Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea,
Herod being tetrarch of Galilee,
his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea
and the region of Trachonitis,
and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
# Luke 3:2
while Annas and Caiaphas were high priests,
the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias
in the wilderness.

# Luke 3:3
And he went into all the region around the Jordan,
preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins,
# Luke 3:4
as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
saying:
{
  The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
  {
    Prepare the way of the Lord;
    Make His paths straight.

# Luke 3:5
    Every valley shall be filled
    And every mountain and hill brought low;
    The crooked places shall be made straight
    And the rough ways smooth;
# Luke 3:6
    And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.
  }
}

# Luke 3:7
Then he said to the multitudes that came out
to be baptized by him,
{
  Brood of vipers!

  Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

# Luke 3:8
  Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance,
  and do not begin to say to yourselves,
  {
    We have Abraham as our father.
  }

  For I say to you that God is able
  to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.

# Luke 3:9
  And even now the ax is laid to the root of the trees.

  Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down
  and thrown into the fire.
}

# Luke 3:10
So the people asked him, saying,
{
  What shall we do then?
}

# Luke 3:11
He answered and said to them,
{
  He who has two tunics,
  let him give to him who has none;
  and he who has food,
  let him do likewise.
}

# Luke 3:12
Then tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him,
{
  Teacher, what shall we do?
}

# Luke 3:13
And he said to them,
{
  Collect no more than what is appointed for you.
}

# Luke 3:14
Likewise the soldiers asked him, saying,
{
  And what shall we do?
}

So he said to them,
{
  Do not intimidate anyone or accuse falsely,
  and be content with your wages.
}

# Luke 3:15
Now as the people were in expectation,
and all reasoned in their hearts about John,
whether he was the Christ or not,
# Luke 3:16
John answered, saying to all,
{
  I indeed baptize you with water;
  but One mightier than I is coming,
  whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose.

  He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.

# Luke 3:17
  His winnowing fan is in His hand,
  and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor,
  and gather the wheat into His barn;
  but the chaff He will burn with unquenchable fire.
}

# Luke 3:18
And with many other exhortations he preached to the people.

# Luke 3:19
But Herod the tetrarch,
being rebuked by him concerning Herodias,
his brother Philip's wife,
and for all the evils which Herod had done,
# Luke 3:20
also added this, above all, that he shut John up in prison.

# Luke 3:21
When all the people were baptized,
it came to pass that Jesus also was baptized;
and while He prayed, the heaven was opened.

# Luke 3:22
And the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him,
and a voice came from heaven which said,
{
  You are My beloved Son;
  in You I am well pleased.
}

# Luke 3:23
Now Jesus Himself began His ministry
at about 30 years of age,
being (as was supposed)
the son of Joseph,
the son of Heli,
# Luke 3:24
the son of Matthat,

the son of Levi,
# Luke 3:30
the son of Simeon,
the son of Judah,
the son of Joseph,

# Luke 3:31
the son of Melea,
the son of Menan,
the son of Mattathah,
the son of Nathan,
the son of David,
# Luke 3:32
the son of Jesse,
the son of Obed,
the son of Boaz,
the son of Salmon,
the son of Nahshon,
# Luke 3:33
the son of Amminadab,
the son of Ram,
the son of Hezron,
the son of Perez,
the son of Judah,
# Luke 3:34
the son of Jacob,
the son of Isaac,
the son of Abraham,
the son of Terah,
the son of Nahor,
# Luke 3:35
the son of Serug,
the son of Reu,
the son of Peleg,

the son of Jared,
the son of Mahalalel,
the son of Cainan,
# Luke 3:38
the son of Enos,
the son of Seth,
the son of Adam,
the son of God.

# Luke 4:1
Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit,
returned from the Jordan
and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
# Luke 4:2
being tempted for 40 days by the devil.

And in those days He ate nothing,
and afterward, when they had ended, He was hungry.

# Luke 4:3
And the devil said to Him,
{
  If You are the Son of God,
  command this stone to become bread.
}

# Luke 4:4
But Jesus answered him, saying,
{
  It is written,
  {
    Man shall not live by bread alone,
    but by every word of God.
  }
}

# Luke 4:5
Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain,
showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

# Luke 4:6
And the devil said to Him,
{
  All this authority I will give You,
  and their glory;
  for this has been delivered to me,
  and I give it to whomever I wish.

# Luke 4:7
  Therefore, if You will worship before me,
  all will be Yours.
}

# Luke 4:8
And Jesus answered and said to him,
{
  Get behind Me, Satan!

  For it is written,
  {
    You shall worship the Lord your God,
    and Him only you shall serve.
  }
}

# Luke 4:9
Then he brought Him to Jerusalem,
set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,
and said to Him,
{
  If You are the Son of God,
  throw Yourself down from here.

# Luke 4:10
  For it is written:
  {
    He shall give His angels charge over you,
    To keep you,
  }
# Luke 4:11
  and,
  {
    In their hands they shall bear you up,
    Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
  }
}

# Luke 4:12
And Jesus answered and said to him,
{
  It has been said,
  {
    You shall not tempt the Lord your God.
  }
}

# Luke 4:13
Now when the devil had ended every temptation,
he departed from Him until an opportune time.

# Luke 4:14
Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee,
and news of Him went out through all the surrounding region.

# Luke 4:15
And He taught in their synagogues,
being glorified by all.

# Luke 4:16
So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up.

And as His custom was,
He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day,
and stood up to read.

# Luke 4:17
And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah.

And when He had opened the book,
He found the place where it was written:
{
# Luke 4:18
  The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,
  Because He has anointed Me
  To preach the gospel to the poor;
  He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted,
  To proclaim liberty to the captives
  And recovery of sight to the blind,
  To set at liberty those who are oppressed;
# Luke 4:19
  To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
}

# Luke 4:20
Then He closed the book,
and gave it back to the attendant and sat down.

And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on Him.

# Luke 4:21
And He began to say to them,
{
  Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.
}

# Luke 4:22
So all bore witness to Him,
and marveled at the gracious words
which proceeded out of His mouth.

And they said,
{
  Is this not Joseph's son?
}

# Luke 4:23
He said to them,
{
  You will surely say this proverb to Me,
  {
    Physician, heal yourself!

    Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum,
    do also here in Your country.
  }
}

# Luke 4:24
Then He said,
{
  Assuredly, I say to you,
  no prophet is accepted in his own country.

# Luke 4:25
  But I tell you truly,
  many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah,
  when the heaven was shut up three years and six months,
  and there was a great famine throughout all the land;
# Luke 4:26
  but to none of them was Elijah sent except to Zarephath,
  in the region of Sidon,
  to a woman who was a widow.

# Luke 4:27
  And many lepers were in Israel
  in the time of Elisha the prophet,
  and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian.
}

# Luke 4:28
So all those in the synagogue,
when they heard these things,
were filled with wrath,
# Luke 4:29
and rose up and thrust Him out of the city;
and they led Him to the brow of the hill
on which their city was built,
that they might throw Him down over the cliff.

# Luke 4:30
Then passing through the midst of them,
He went His way.

# Luke 4:31
Then He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee,
and was teaching them on the Sabbaths.

# Luke 4:32
And they were astonished at His teaching,
for His word was with authority.

# Luke 4:33
Now in the synagogue there was a man
who had a spirit of an unclean demon.

And he cried out with a loud voice,
# Luke 4:34
saying,
{
  Let us alone!

  What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth?

  Did You come to destroy us?

  I know who You are -- the Holy One of God!
}

# Luke 4:35
But Jesus rebuked him, saying,
{
  Be quiet, and come out of him!
}

And when the demon had thrown him in their midst,
it came out of him and did not hurt him.

# Luke 4:36
Then they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying,
{
  What a word this is!

  For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits,
  and they come out.
}

# Luke 4:37
And the report about Him went out
into every place
in the surrounding region.

# Luke 4:38
Now He arose from the synagogue and entered Simon's house.

But Simon's wife's mother was sick with a high fever,
and they made request of Him concerning her.

# Luke 4:39
So He stood over her and rebuked the fever,
and it left her.

And immediately she arose and served them.

# Luke 4:40
When the sun was setting,
all those who had any that were sick with various diseases
brought them to Him;
and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them.

# Luke 4:41
And demons also came out of many,
crying out and saying,
{
  You are the Christ, the Son of God!
}

And He, rebuking them, did not allow them to speak,
for they knew that He was the Christ.

# Luke 4:42
Now when it was day,
He departed and went into a deserted place.

And the crowd sought Him and came to Him,
and tried to keep Him from leaving them;
# Luke 4:43
but He said to them,
{
  I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also,
  because for this purpose I have been sent.
}

# Luke 4:44
And He was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.

# Luke 5:1
So it was,
as the multitude pressed about Him
to hear the word of God,
that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,
# Luke 5:2
and saw two boats standing by the lake;
but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets.

# Luke 5:3
Then He got into one of the boats,
which was Simon's,
and asked him to put out a little from the land.

And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat.

# Luke 5:4
When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon,
{
  Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.
}

# Luke 5:5
But Simon answered and said to Him,
{
  Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing;
  nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.
}

# Luke 5:6
And when they had done this,
they caught a great number of fish,
and their net was breaking.

# Luke 5:7
So they signaled to their partners in the other boat
to come and help them.

And they came and filled both the boats,
so that they began to sink.

# Luke 5:8
When Simon Peter saw it,
he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,
{
  Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!
}

# Luke 5:9
For he and all who were with him were astonished
at the catch of fish which they had taken;
# Luke 5:10
and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
who were partners with Simon.

And Jesus said to Simon,
{
  Do not be afraid.

  From now on you will catch men.
}

# Luke 5:11
So when they had brought their boats to land,
they forsook all and followed Him.

# Luke 5:12
And it happened when He was in a certain city,
that behold, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus;
and he fell on his face and implored Him, saying,
{
  Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.
}

# Luke 5:13
Then He put out His hand and touched him, saying,
{
  I am willing; be cleansed.
}

Immediately the leprosy left him.

# Luke 5:14
And He charged him to tell no one,
{
  But go and show yourself to the priest,
  and make an offering for your cleansing,
  as a testimony to them,
  just as Moses commanded.
}

# Luke 5:15
However, the report went around concerning Him all the more;
and great multitudes came together to hear,
and to be healed by Him of their infirmities.

# Luke 5:16
So He Himself often withdrew into the wilderness
and prayed.

# Luke 5:17
Now it happened on a certain day, as He was teaching,
that there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by,
who had come out of every town of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem.

And the power of the Lord was present to heal them.

# Luke 5:18
Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed,
whom they sought to bring in and lay before Him.

# Luke 5:19
And when they could not find how they might bring him in,
because of the crowd,
they went up on the housetop
and let him down with his bed
through the tiling into the midst before Jesus.

# Luke 5:20
When He saw their faith, He said to him,
{
  Man, your sins are forgiven you.
}

# Luke 5:21
And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying,
{
  Who is this who speaks blasphemies?

  Who can forgive sins but God alone?
}

# Luke 5:22
But when Jesus perceived their thoughts,
He answered and said to them,
{
  Why are you reasoning in your hearts?

# Luke 5:23
  Which is easier, to say,
  {
    Your sins are forgiven you,
  }
  or to say,
  {
    Rise up and walk
  }?

# Luke 5:24
  But that you may know
  that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins
}--
He said to the man who was paralyzed,
{
  I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.
}

# Luke 5:25
Immediately he rose up before them,
took up what he had been lying on,
and departed to his own house,
glorifying God.

# Luke 5:26
And they were all amazed,
and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying,
{
  We have seen strange things today!
}

# Luke 5:27
After these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi,
sitting at the tax office.

And He said to him, "Follow Me."

# Luke 5:28
So he left all, rose up, and followed Him.

# Luke 5:29
Then Levi gave Him a great feast in his own house.

And there were a great number of tax collectors and others
who sat down with them.

# Luke 5:30
And their scribes and the Pharisees complained
against His disciples, saying,
{
  Why do You eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?
}

# Luke 5:31
Jesus answered and said to them,
{
  Those who are well have no need of a physician,
  but those who are sick.

# Luke 5:32
  I have not come to call the righteous,
  but sinners,
  to repentance.
}

# Luke 5:33
Then they said to Him,
{
  Why do the disciples of John fast often
  and make prayers,
  and likewise those of the Pharisees,
  but Yours eat and drink?
}

# Luke 5:34
And He said to them,
{
  Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast
  while the bridegroom is with them?

# Luke 5:35
  But the days will come
  when the bridegroom will be taken away from them;
  then they will fast in those days.
}

# Luke 5:36
Then He spoke a parable to them:
{
  No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one;
  otherwise the new makes a tear,
  and also the piece that was taken out of the new
  does not match the old.

# Luke 5:37
  And no one puts new wine into old wineskins;
  or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled,
  and the wineskins will be ruined.

# Luke 5:38
  But new wine must be put into new wineskins,
  and both are preserved.

# Luke 5:39
  And no one, having drunk old wine, immediately desires new;
  for he says,
  {
    The old is better.
  }
}

# Luke 6:1
Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first
that He went through the grainfields.

And His disciples plucked the heads of grain and ate them,
rubbing them in their hands.

# Luke 6:2
And some of the Pharisees said to them,
{
  Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?
}

# Luke 6:3
But Jesus answering them said,
{
  Have you not even read this,
  what David did when he was hungry,
  he and those who were with him:
# Luke 6:4
  how he went into the house of God,
  took and ate the showbread,
  and also gave some to those with him,
  which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?
}

# Luke 6:5
And He said to them,
{
  The Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.
}

# Luke 6:6
Now it happened on another Sabbath, also,
that He entered the synagogue and taught.

And a man was there whose right hand was withered.

# Luke 6:7
So the scribes and Pharisees watched Him closely,
whether He would heal on the Sabbath,
that they might find an accusation against Him.

# Luke 6:8
But He knew their thoughts,
and said to the man who had the withered hand,
{
  Arise and stand here.
}

And he arose and stood.

# Luke 6:9
Then Jesus said to them,
{
  I will ask you one thing:
  Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil,
  to save life or to destroy?
}

# Luke 6:10
And when He had looked around at them all,
He said to the man,
{
  Stretch out your hand.
}

And he did so,
and his hand was restored as whole as the other.

# Luke 6:11
But they were filled with rage,
and discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.

# Luke 6:12
Now it came to pass in those days
that He went out to the mountain to pray,
and continued all night in prayer to God.

# Luke 6:13
And when it was day, He called His disciples to Himself;
and from them He chose 12 whom He also named apostles:

# Luke 6:14
Simon, whom He also named Peter,
and Andrew his brother;
James and John;
Philip and Bartholomew;
# Luke 6:15
Matthew and Thomas;
James the son of Alphaeus,
and Simon called the Zealot;
# Luke 6:16
Judas the son of James,
and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.

# Luke 6:17
And He came down with them and stood on a level place
with a crowd of His disciples
and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem,
and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon,
who came to hear Him and be healed of their diseases,
# Luke 6:18
as well as those who were tormented with unclean spirits.

And they were healed.

# Luke 6:19
And the whole multitude sought to touch Him,
for power went out from Him and healed them all.

# Luke 6:20
Then He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples, and said:
{
  Blessed are you poor,
  For yours is the kingdom of God.

# Luke 6:21
  Blessed are you who hunger now,
  For you shall be filled.

  Blessed are you who weep now,
  For you shall laugh.

# Luke 6:22
  Blessed are you when men hate you,
  And when they exclude you,
  And revile you, and cast out your name as evil,
  For the Son of Man's sake.

# Luke 6:23
  Rejoice in that day and leap for joy!

  For indeed your reward is great in heaven,
  For in like manner their fathers did to the prophets.

# Luke 6:24
  But woe to you who are rich,
  For you have received your consolation.

# Luke 6:25
  Woe to you who are full,
  For you shall hunger.

  Woe to you who laugh now,
  For you shall mourn and weep.

# Luke 6:26
  Woe to you when all men speak well of you,
  For so did their fathers to the false prophets.

# Luke 6:27
  But I say to you who hear:
  Love your enemies,
  do good to those who hate you,
# Luke 6:28
  bless those who curse you,
  and pray for those who spitefully use you.

# Luke 6:29
  To him who strikes you on the one cheek,
  offer the other also.

  And from him who takes away your cloak,
  do not withhold your tunic either.

# Luke 6:30
  Give to everyone who asks of you.

  And from him who takes away your goods
  do not ask them back.

# Luke 6:31
  And just as you want men to do to you,
  you also do to them likewise.

# Luke 6:32
  But if you love those who love you,
  what credit is that to you?

  For even sinners love those who love them.

# Luke 6:33
  And if you do good to those who do good to you,
  what credit is that to you?

  For even sinners do the same.

# Luke 6:34
  And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back,
  what credit is that to you?

  For even sinners lend to sinners to receive as much back.

# Luke 6:35
  But love your enemies,
  do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return;
  and your reward will be great,
  and you will be sons of the Most High.

  For He is kind to the unthankful and evil.

# Luke 6:36
  Therefore be merciful,
  just as your Father also is merciful.

# Luke 6:37
  Judge not, and you shall not be judged.

  Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned.

  Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

# Luke 6:38
  Give, and it will be given to you:
  good measure, pressed down, shaken together,
  and running over will be put into your bosom.

  For with the same measure that you use,
  it will be measured back to you.
}

# Luke 6:39
And He spoke a parable to them:
{
  Can the blind lead the blind?

  Will they not both fall into the ditch?

# Luke 6:40
  A disciple is not above his teacher,
  but everyone who is perfectly trained will be like his teacher.

# Luke 6:41
  And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye,
  but do not perceive the plank in your own eye?

# Luke 6:42
  Or how can you say to your brother,
  {
    Brother, let me remove the speck that is in your eye,
  }
  when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye?

  Hypocrite!

  First remove the plank from your own eye,
  and then you will see clearly
  to remove the speck that is in your brother's eye.

# Luke 6:43
  For a good tree does not bear bad fruit,
  nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.

# Luke 6:44
  For every tree is known by its own fruit.

  For men do not gather figs from thorns,
  nor do they gather grapes from a bramble bush.

# Luke 6:45
  A good man out of the good treasure of his heart
  brings forth good;
  and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart
  brings forth evil.

  For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.

# Luke 6:46
  But why do you call Me "Lord, Lord,"
  and do not do the things which I say?

# Luke 6:47
  Whoever comes to Me,
  and hears My sayings and does them,
  I will show you whom he is like:

# Luke 6:48
  He is like a man building a house,
  who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock.

  And when the flood arose,
  the stream beat vehemently against that house,
  and could not shake it,
  for it was founded on the rock.

# Luke 6:49
  But he who heard and did nothing
  is like a man who built a house on the earth
  without a foundation,
  against which the stream beat vehemently;
  and immediately it fell.

  And the ruin of that house was great.
}

# Luke 7:1
Now when He concluded all His sayings
in the hearing of the people,
He entered Capernaum.

# Luke 7:2
And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear to him,
was sick and ready to die.

# Luke 7:3
So when he heard about Jesus,
he sent elders of the Jews to Him,
pleading with Him to come and heal his servant.

# Luke 7:4
And when they came to Jesus,
they begged Him earnestly,
saying that the one for whom He should do this was deserving,
{
# Luke 7:5
  for he loves our nation,
  and has built us a synagogue.
}

# Luke 7:6
Then Jesus went with them.

And when He was already not far from the house,
the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him,
{
  Lord, do not trouble Yourself,
  for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.

# Luke 7:7
  Therefore I did not even think myself worthy to come to You.

  But say the word, and my servant will be healed.

# Luke 7:8
  For I also am a man placed under authority,
  having soldiers under me.

  And I say to one, "Go," and he goes;
  and to another, "Come," and he comes;
  and to my servant, "Do this," and he does it.
}

# Luke 7:9
When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him,
and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him,
{
  I say to you,
  I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!
}

# Luke 7:10
And those who were sent,
returning to the house,
found the servant well who had been sick.

# Luke 7:11
Now it happened, the day after,
that He went into a city called Nain;
and many of His disciples went with Him,
and a large crowd.

# Luke 7:12
And when He came near the gate of the city,
behold, a dead man was being carried out,
the only son of his mother;
and she was a widow.

And a large crowd from the city was with her.

# Luke 7:13
When the Lord saw her,
He had compassion on her and said to her,
{
  Do not weep.
}

# Luke 7:14
Then He came and touched the open coffin,
and those who carried him stood still.

And He said,
{
  Young man, I say to you, arise.
}

# Luke 7:15
So he who was dead sat up and began to speak.

And He presented him to his mother.

# Luke 7:16
Then fear came upon all,
and they glorified God, saying,
{
  A great prophet has risen up among us
};
and,
{
  God has visited His people.
}

# Luke 7:17
And this report about Him went throughout all Judea
and all the surrounding region.

# Luke 7:18
Then the disciples of John reported to him
concerning all these things.

# Luke 7:19
And John, calling two of his disciples to him,
sent them to Jesus, saying,
{
  Are You the Coming One,
  or do we look for another?
}

# Luke 7:20
When the men had come to Him, they said,
{
  John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying,
  {
    Are You the Coming One,
    or do we look for another?
  }
}

# Luke 7:21
And that very hour
He cured many of infirmities, afflictions, and evil spirits;
and to many blind He gave sight.

# Luke 7:22
Jesus answered and said to them,
{
  Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard:
  that the blind see,
  the lame walk,
  the lepers are cleansed,
  the deaf hear,
  the dead are raised,
  the poor have the gospel preached to them.

# Luke 7:23
  And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.
}

# Luke 7:24
When the messengers of John had departed,
He began to speak to the multitudes concerning John:
{
  What did you go out into the wilderness to see?

  A reed shaken by the wind?

# Luke 7:25
  But what did you go out to see?

  A man clothed in soft garments?

  Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled
  and live in luxury are in kings' courts.

# Luke 7:26
  But what did you go out to see?

  A prophet?

  Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.

# Luke 7:27
  This is he of whom it is written:
  {
    Behold, I send My messenger before Your face,
    Who will prepare Your way before You.
  }

# Luke 7:28
  For I say to you, among those born of women
  there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist;
  but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
}

# Luke 7:29
And when all the people heard Him,
even the tax collectors justified God,
having been baptized with the baptism of John.

# Luke 7:30
But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the will of God
for themselves,
not having been baptized by him.

# Luke 7:31
And the Lord said,
{
  To what then shall I liken the men of this generation,
  and what are they like?

# Luke 7:32
  They are like children sitting in the marketplace
  and calling to one another, saying:
  {
    We played the flute for you,
    And you did not dance;
    We mourned to you,
    And you did not weep.
  }

# Luke 7:33
  For John the Baptist came
  neither eating bread nor drinking wine,
  and you say,
  {
    He has a demon.
  }

# Luke 7:34
  The Son of Man has come eating and drinking,
  and you say,
  {
    Look, a glutton and a winebibber,
    a friend of tax collectors and sinners!
  }

# Luke 7:35
  But wisdom is justified by all her children.
}

# Luke 7:36
Then one of the Pharisees
asked Him to eat with him.

And He went to the Pharisee's house, and sat down to eat.

# Luke 7:37
And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner,
when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee's house,
brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil,
# Luke 7:38
and stood at His feet behind Him weeping;
and she began to wash His feet with her tears,
and wiped them with the hair of her head;
and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil.

# Luke 7:39
Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this,
he spoke to himself, saying,
{
  This man, if He were a prophet,
  would know who and what manner of woman this is
  who is touching Him,
  for she is a sinner.
}

# Luke 7:40
And Jesus answered and said to him,
{
  Simon, I have something to say to you.
}

So he said,
{
  Teacher, say it.
}

{
# Luke 7:41
  There was a certain creditor
  who had two debtors.

  One owed 500 denarii,
  and the other 50.

# Luke 7:42
  And when they had nothing with which to repay,
  he freely forgave them both.

  Tell Me, therefore,
  which of them will love him more?
}

# Luke 7:43
Simon answered and said,
{
  I suppose the one whom he forgave more.
}

And He said to him,
{
  You have rightly judged.
}

# Luke 7:44
Then He turned to the woman and said to Simon,
{
  Do you see this woman?

  I entered your house;
  you gave Me no water for My feet,
  but she has washed My feet with her tears
  and wiped them with the hair of her head.

# Luke 7:45
  You gave Me no kiss,
  but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet
  since the time I came in.

# Luke 7:46
  You did not anoint My head with oil,
  but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil.

# Luke 7:47
  Therefore I say to you,
  her sins, which are many, are forgiven,
  for she loved much.

  But to whom little is forgiven,
  the same loves little.
}

# Luke 7:48
Then He said to her,
{
  Your sins are forgiven.
}

# Luke 7:49
And those who sat at the table with Him
began to say to themselves,
{
  Who is this who even forgives sins?
}

# Luke 7:50
Then He said to the woman,
{
  Your faith has saved you.

  Go in peace.
}

# Luke 8:1
Now it came to pass, afterward,
that He went through every city and village,
preaching and bringing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God.

And the 12 were with Him,
# Luke 8:2
and certain women
who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities --
Mary called Magdalene, out of whom had come seven demons,
# Luke 8:3
and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward,
and Susanna,
and many others who provided for Him from their substance.

# Luke 8:4
And when a great multitude had gathered,
and they had come to Him from every city,
He spoke by a parable:
{
# Luke 8:5
  A sower went out to sow his seed.

  And as he sowed, some fell by the wayside;
  and it was trampled down,
  and the birds of the air devoured it.

# Luke 8:6
  Some fell on rock;
  and as soon as it sprang up,
  it withered away because it lacked moisture.

# Luke 8:7
  And some fell among thorns,
  and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.

# Luke 8:8
  But others fell on good ground,
  sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.
}

When He had said these things He cried,
{
  He who has ears to hear, let him hear!
}

# Luke 8:9
Then His disciples asked Him, saying,
{
  What does this parable mean?
}

# Luke 8:10
And He said,
{
  To you it has been given
  to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God,
  but to the rest it is given in parables, that
  {
    Seeing they may not see,
    And hearing they may not understand.
  }

# Luke 8:11
  Now the parable is this:
  The seed is the word of God.

# Luke 8:12
  Those by the wayside are the ones who hear;
  then the devil comes
  and takes away the word out of their hearts,
  lest they should believe and be saved.

# Luke 8:13
  But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear,
  receive the word with joy;
  and these have no root,
  who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.

# Luke 8:14
  Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who,
  when they have heard,
  go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life,
  and bring no fruit to maturity.

# Luke 8:15
  But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who,
  having heard the word with a noble and good heart,
  keep it and bear fruit with patience.

# Luke 8:16
  No one, when he has lit a lamp,
  covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed,
  but sets it on a lampstand,
  that those who enter may see the light.

# Luke 8:17
  For nothing is secret that will not be revealed,
  nor anything hidden
  that will not be known and come to light.

# Luke 8:18
  Therefore take heed how you hear.

  For whoever has,
  to him more will be given;
  and whoever does not have,
  even what he seems to have will be taken from him.
}

# Luke 8:19
Then His mother and brothers came to Him,
and could not approach Him because of the crowd.

# Luke 8:20
And it was told Him by some, who said,
{
  Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside,
  desiring to see You.
}

# Luke 8:21
But He answered and said to them,
{
  My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God
  and do it.
}

# Luke 8:22
Now it happened, on a certain day,
that He got into a boat with His disciples.

And He said to them,
{
  Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.
}

And they launched out.

# Luke 8:23
But as they sailed He fell asleep.

And a windstorm came down on the lake,
and they were filling with water,
and were in jeopardy.

# Luke 8:24
And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying,
{
  Master, Master, we are perishing!
}

Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water.

And they ceased, and there was a calm.

# Luke 8:25
But He said to them,
{
  Where is your faith?
}

And they were afraid, and marveled, saying to one another,
{
  Who can this be?

  For He commands even the winds and water, and they obey Him!
}

# Luke 8:26
Then they sailed to the country of the Gadarenes,
which is opposite Galilee.

# Luke 8:27
And when He stepped out on the land,
there met Him a certain man
from the city who had demons for a long time.

And he wore no clothes,
nor did he live in a house but in the tombs.

# Luke 8:28
When he saw Jesus, he cried out,
fell down before Him,
and with a loud voice said,
{
  What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?

  I beg You, do not torment me!
}

# Luke 8:29
For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man.

For it had often seized him,
and he was kept under guard,
bound with chains and shackles;
and he broke the bonds
and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.

# Luke 8:30
Jesus asked him, saying,
{
  What is your name?
}

And he said,
{
  Legion,
}
because many demons had entered him.

# Luke 8:31
And they begged Him
that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.

# Luke 8:32
Now a herd of many swine was feeding there on the mountain.

So they begged Him that He would permit them to enter them.

And He permitted them.

# Luke 8:33
Then the demons went out of the man and entered the swine,
and the herd ran violently down the steep place
into the lake and drowned.

# Luke 8:34
When those who fed them saw what had happened,
they fled and told it in the city and in the country.

# Luke 8:35
Then they went out to see what had happened,
and came to Jesus,
and found the man from whom the demons had departed,
sitting at the feet of Jesus,
clothed and in his right mind.

And they were afraid.

# Luke 8:36
They also who had seen it told them by what means
he who had been demon-possessed was healed.

# Luke 8:37
Then the whole multitude
of the surrounding region of the Gadarenes
asked Him to depart from them,
for they were seized with great fear.

And He got into the boat and returned.

# Luke 8:38
Now the man from whom the demons had departed
begged Him that he might be with Him.

But Jesus sent him away, saying,
{
# Luke 8:39
  Return to your own house,
  and tell what great things God has done for you.
}

And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city
what great things Jesus had done for him.

# Luke 8:40
So it was, when Jesus returned,
that the multitude welcomed Him,
for they were all waiting for Him.

# Luke 8:41
And behold, there came a man named Jairus,
and he was a ruler of the synagogue.

And he fell down at Jesus' feet
and begged Him to come to his house,
# Luke 8:42
for he had an only daughter about 12 years of age,
and she was dying.

But as He went, the multitudes thronged Him.

# Luke 8:43
Now a woman, having a flow of blood for 12 years,
who had spent all her livelihood on physicians
and could not be healed by any,
# Luke 8:44
came from behind and touched the border of His garment.

And immediately her flow of blood stopped.

# Luke 8:45
And Jesus said,
{
  Who touched Me?
}

When all denied it, Peter and those with him said,
{
  Master, the multitudes throng and press You, and You say,
  {
    Who touched Me?
  }
}

# Luke 8:46
But Jesus said,
{
  Somebody touched Me,
  for I perceived power going out from Me.
}

# Luke 8:47
Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden,
she came trembling;
and falling down before Him,
she declared to Him in the presence of all the people
the reason she had touched Him
and how she was healed immediately.

# Luke 8:48
And He said to her,
{
  Daughter, be of good cheer;
  your faith has made you well.

  Go in peace.
}

# Luke 8:49
While He was still speaking,
someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house,
saying to him,
{
  Your daughter is dead.

  Do not trouble the Teacher.
}

# Luke 8:50
But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying,
{
  Do not be afraid;
  only believe, and she will be made well.
}

# Luke 8:51
When He came into the house,
He permitted no one to go in
except Peter, James, and John,
and the father and mother of the girl.

# Luke 8:52
Now all wept and mourned for her;
but He said,
{
  Do not weep;
  she is not dead, but sleeping.
}

# Luke 8:53
And they ridiculed Him, knowing that she was dead.

# Luke 8:54
But He put them all outside,
took her by the hand and called, saying,
{
  Little girl, arise.
}

# Luke 8:55
Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately.

And He commanded that she be given something to eat.

# Luke 8:56
And her parents were astonished,
but He charged them to tell no one what had happened.

# Luke 9:1
Then He called His 12 disciples together
and gave them power and authority over all demons,
and to cure diseases.

# Luke 9:2
He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.

# Luke 9:3
And He said to them,
{
  Take nothing for the journey,
  neither staffs nor bag nor bread nor money;
  and do not have two tunics apiece.

# Luke 9:4
  Whatever house you enter, stay there, and from there depart.

# Luke 9:5
  And whoever will not receive you,
  when you go out of that city,
  shake off the very dust from your feet
  as a testimony against them.
}

# Luke 9:6
So they departed and went through the towns,
preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.

# Luke 9:7
Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by Him;
and he was perplexed,
because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,
# Luke 9:8
and by some that Elijah had appeared,
and by others that one of the old prophets had risen again.

# Luke 9:9
Herod said,
{
  John I have beheaded,
  but who is this of whom I hear such things?
}

So he sought to see Him.

# Luke 9:10
And the apostles, when they had returned,
told Him all that they had done.

Then He took them
and went aside privately into a deserted place
belonging to the city called Bethsaida.

# Luke 9:11
But when the multitudes knew it, they followed Him;
and He received them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God,
and healed those who had need of healing.

# Luke 9:12
When the day began to wear away,
the 12 came and said to Him,
{
  Send the multitude away,
  that they may go into the surrounding towns and country,
  and lodge and get provisions;
  for we are in a deserted place here.
}

# Luke 9:13
But He said to them,
{
  You give them something to eat.
}

And they said,
{
  We have no more than five loaves and two fish,
  unless we go and buy food for all these people.
}

# Luke 9:14
For there were about 5000 men.

Then He said to His disciples,
{
  Make them sit down in groups of 50.
}

# Luke 9:15
And they did so, and made them all sit down.

# Luke 9:16
Then He took the five loaves and the two fish,
and looking up to heaven,
He blessed and broke them,
and gave them to the disciples to set before the multitude.

# Luke 9:17
So they all ate and were filled,
and 12 baskets of the leftover fragments were taken up by them.

# Luke 9:18
And it happened, as He was alone praying,
that His disciples joined Him,
and He asked them, saying,
{
  Who do the crowds say that I am?
}

# Luke 9:19
So they answered and said,
{
  John the Baptist, but some say Elijah;
  and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.
}

# Luke 9:20
He said to them,
{
  But who do you say that I am?
}

Peter answered and said,
{
  The Christ of God.
}

# Luke 9:21
And He strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,
# Luke 9:22
saying,
{
  The Son of Man must suffer many things,
  and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes,
  and be killed,
  and be raised the third day.
}

# Luke 9:23
Then He said to them all,
{
  If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself,
  and take up his cross daily,
  and follow Me.

# Luke 9:24
  For whoever desires to save his life will lose it,
  but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.

# Luke 9:25
  For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world,
  and is himself destroyed or lost?

# Luke 9:26
  For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words,
  of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes
  in His own glory,
  and in His Father's,
  and of the holy angels.

# Luke 9:27
  But I tell you truly,
  there are some standing here
  who shall not taste death
  till they see the kingdom of God.
}

# Luke 9:28
Now it came to pass,
about eight days after these sayings,
that He took Peter, John, and James
and went up on the mountain to pray.

# Luke 9:29
As He prayed,
the appearance of His face was altered,
and His robe became white and glistening.

# Luke 9:30
And behold,
two men talked with Him,
who were Moses and Elijah,
# Luke 9:31
who appeared in glory
and spoke of His decease
which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.

# Luke 9:32
But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep;
and when they were fully awake,
they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.

# Luke 9:33
Then it happened,
as they were parting from Him,
that Peter said to Jesus,
{
  Master, it is good for us to be here;
  and let us make three tabernacles:
  one for You,
  one for Moses,
  and one for Elijah
}--
not knowing what he said.

# Luke 9:34
While he was saying this,
a cloud came and overshadowed them;
and they were fearful as they entered the cloud.

# Luke 9:35
And a voice came out of the cloud, saying,
{
  This is My beloved Son.

  Hear Him!
}

# Luke 9:36
When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone.

But they kept quiet,
and told no one in those days
any of the things they had seen.

# Luke 9:37
Now it happened on the next day,
when they had come down from the mountain,
that a great multitude met Him.

# Luke 9:38
Suddenly a man from the multitude cried out, saying,
{
  Teacher, I implore You, look on my son,
  for he is my only child.

# Luke 9:39
  And behold, a spirit seizes him,
  and he suddenly cries out;
  it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth,
  and it departs from him with great difficulty,
  bruising him.

# Luke 9:40
  So I implored Your disciples to cast it out,
  but they could not.
}

# Luke 9:41
Then Jesus answered and said,
{
  O faithless and perverse generation,
  how long shall I be with you and bear with you?

  Bring your son here.
}

# Luke 9:42
And as he was still coming,
the demon threw him down and convulsed him.

Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit,
healed the child,
and gave him back to his father.

# Luke 9:43
And they were all amazed at the majesty of God.

But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did,
He said to His disciples,
{
# Luke 9:44
  Let these words sink down into your ears,
  for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed
  into the hands of men.
}

# Luke 9:45
But they did not understand this saying,
and it was hidden from them
so that they did not perceive it;
and they were afraid
to ask Him about this saying.

# Luke 9:46
Then a dispute arose among them
as to which of them would be greatest.

# Luke 9:47
And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart,
took a little child and set him by Him,
# Luke 9:48
and said to them,
{
  Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me;
  and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me.

  For he who is least among you all will be great.
}

# Luke 9:49
Now John answered and said,
{
  Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name,
  and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.
}

# Luke 9:50
But Jesus said to him,
{
  Do not forbid him,
  for he who is not against us is on our side.
}

# Luke 9:51
Now it came to pass,
when the time had come for Him to be received up,
that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem,
# Luke 9:52
and sent messengers before His face.

And as they went,
they entered a village of the Samaritans,
to prepare for Him.

# Luke 9:53
But they did not receive Him,
because His face was set for the journey to Jerusalem.

# Luke 9:54
And when His disciples James and John saw this, they said,
{
  Lord, do You want us to command fire
  to come down from heaven and consume them,
  just as Elijah did?
}

# Luke 9:55
But He turned and rebuked them, and said,
{
  You do not know what manner of spirit you are of.

# Luke 9:56
  For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives
  but to save them.
}

And they went to another village.

# Luke 9:57
Now it happened as they journeyed on the road,
that someone said to Him,
{
  Lord, I will follow You wherever You go.
}

# Luke 9:58
And Jesus said to him,
{
  Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests,
  but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.
}

# Luke 9:59
Then He said to another, "Follow Me."

But he said,
{
  Lord, let me first go and bury my father.
}

# Luke 9:60
Jesus said to him,
{
  Let the dead bury their own dead,
  but you go and preach the kingdom of God.
}

# Luke 9:61
And another also said,
{
  Lord, I will follow You,
  but let me first go and bid them farewell who are at my house.
}

# Luke 9:62
But Jesus said to him,
{
  No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back,
  is fit for the kingdom of God.
}

# Luke 10:1
After these things the Lord appointed 70 others also,
and sent them two by two before His face
into every city and place where He Himself was about to go.

# Luke 10:2
Then He said to them,
{
  The harvest truly is great,
  but the laborers are few;
  therefore pray the Lord of the harvest
  to send out laborers into His harvest.

# Luke 10:3
  Go your way;
  behold, I send you out as lambs among wolves.

# Luke 10:4
  Carry neither money bag, knapsack, nor sandals;
  and greet no one along the road.

# Luke 10:5
  But whatever house you enter, first say,
  {
    Peace to this house.
  }

# Luke 10:6
  And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on it;
  if not, it will return to you.

# Luke 10:7
  And remain in the same house,
  eating and drinking such things as they give,
  for the laborer is worthy of his wages.

  Do not go from house to house.

# Luke 10:8
  Whatever city you enter, and they receive you,
  eat such things as are set before you.

# Luke 10:9
  And heal the sick there, and say to them,
  {
    The kingdom of God has come near to you.
  }

# Luke 10:10
  But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you,
  go out into its streets and say,
  {
# Luke 10:11
    The very dust of your city which clings to us
    we wipe off against you.

    Nevertheless know this,
    that the kingdom of God has come near you.
  }

# Luke 10:12
  But I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day
  for Sodom than for that city.

# Luke 10:13
  Woe to you, Chorazin!

  Woe to you, Bethsaida!

  For if the mighty works which were done in you
  had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
  they would have repented long ago,
  sitting in sackcloth and ashes.

# Luke 10:14
  But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
  at the judgment
  than for you.

# Luke 10:15
  And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven,
  will be brought down to Hades.

# Luke 10:16
  He who hears you hears Me,
  he who rejects you rejects Me,
  and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me.
}

# Luke 10:17
Then the 70 returned with joy, saying,
{
  Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.
}

# Luke 10:18
And He said to them,
{
  I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.

# Luke 10:19
  Behold, I give you the authority
  to trample on serpents and scorpions,
  and over all the power of the enemy,
  and nothing shall by any means hurt you.

# Luke 10:20
  Nevertheless do not rejoice in this,
  that the spirits are subject to you,
  but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.
}

# Luke 10:21
In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said,
{
  I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
  that You have hidden these things
  from the wise and prudent
  and revealed them to babes.

  Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.

# Luke 10:22
  All things have been delivered to Me by My Father,
  and no one knows who the Son is except the Father,
  and who the Father is except the Son,
  and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.
}

# Luke 10:23
Then He turned to His disciples and said privately,
{
  Blessed are the eyes which see the things you see;
# Luke 10:24
  for I tell you that many prophets and kings
  have desired to see what you see,
  and have not seen it,
  and to hear what you hear,
  and have not heard it.
}

# Luke 10:25
And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying,
{
  Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
}

# Luke 10:26
He said to him,
{
  What is written in the law?

  What is your reading of it?
}

# Luke 10:27
So he answered and said,
{
  {
    You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart,
    with all your soul,
    with all your strength,
    and with all your mind,
  }
  and
  {
    your neighbor as yourself.
  }
}

# Luke 10:28
And He said to him,
{
  You have answered rightly;
  do this and you will live.
}

# Luke 10:29
But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus,
{
  And who is my neighbor?
}

# Luke 10:30
Then Jesus answered and said:
{
  A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho,
  and fell among thieves,
  who stripped him of his clothing,
  wounded him,
  and departed,
  leaving him half dead.

# Luke 10:31
  Now by chance a certain priest came down that road.

  And when he saw him,
  he passed by on the other side.

# Luke 10:32
  Likewise a Levite,
  when he arrived at the place,
  came and looked,
  and passed by on the other side.

# Luke 10:33
  But a certain Samaritan,
  as he journeyed,
  came where he was.

  And when he saw him,
  he had compassion.

# Luke 10:34
  So he went to him and bandaged his wounds,
  pouring on oil and wine;
  and he set him on his own animal,
  brought him to an inn,
  and took care of him.

# Luke 10:35
  On the next day, when he departed,
  he took out two denarii,
  gave them to the innkeeper,
  and said to him,
  {
    Take care of him;
    and whatever more you spend,
    when I come again, I will repay you.
  }

# Luke 10:36
  So which of these three do you think
  was neighbor to him who fell among the thieves?
}

# Luke 10:37
And he said,
{
  He who showed mercy on him.
}

Then Jesus said to him,
{
  Go and do likewise.
}

# Luke 10:38
Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village;
and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house.

# Luke 10:39
And she had a sister called Mary,
who also sat at Jesus' feet and heard His word.

# Luke 10:40
But Martha was distracted with much serving,
and she approached Him and said,
{
  Lord,
  do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?

  Therefore tell her to help me.
}

# Luke 10:41
And Jesus answered and said to her,
{
  Martha, Martha,
  you are worried and troubled about many things.

# Luke 10:42
  But one thing is needed,
  and Mary has chosen that good part,
  which will not be taken away from her.
}

# Luke 11:1
Now it came to pass,
as He was praying in a certain place,
when He ceased,
that one of His disciples said to Him,
{
  Lord, teach us to pray,
  as John also taught his disciples.
}

# Luke 11:2
So He said to them,
{
  When you pray, say:
  {
    Our Father in heaven,
    Hallowed be Your name.

    Your kingdom come.

    Your will be done
    On earth as it is in heaven.

# Luke 11:3
    Give us day by day our daily bread.

# Luke 11:4
    And forgive us our sins,
    For we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.

    And do not lead us into temptation,
    But deliver us from the evil one.
  }
}

# Luke 11:5
And He said to them,
{
  Which of you shall have a friend,
  and go to him at midnight and say to him,
  {
    Friend, lend me three loaves;
# Luke 11:6
    for a friend of mine has come to me on his journey,
    and I have nothing to set before him
  };
# Luke 11:7
  and he will answer from within and say,
  {
    Do not trouble me;
    the door is now shut,
    and my children are with me in bed;
    I cannot rise and give to you
  }?

# Luke 11:8
  I say to you,
  though he will not rise and give to him
  because he is his friend,
  yet because of his persistence
  he will rise and give him as many as he needs.

# Luke 11:9
  So I say to you,
  ask, and it will be given to you;
  seek, and you will find;
  knock, and it will be opened to you.

# Luke 11:10
  For everyone who asks receives,
  and he who seeks finds,
  and to him who knocks it will be opened.

# Luke 11:11
  If a son asks for bread
  from any father among you,
  will he give him a stone?

  Or if he asks for a fish,
  will he give him a serpent instead of a fish?

# Luke 11:12
  Or if he asks for an egg,
  will he offer him a scorpion?

# Luke 11:13
  If you then, being evil,
  know how to give good gifts to your children,
  how much more will your heavenly Father
  give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!
}

# Luke 11:14
And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute.

So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute spoke;
and the multitudes marveled.

# Luke 11:15
But some of them said,
{
  He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.
}

# Luke 11:16
Others, testing Him, sought from Him a sign from heaven.

# Luke 11:17
But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them:
{
  Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation,
  and a house divided against a house falls.

# Luke 11:18
  If Satan also is divided against himself,
  how will his kingdom stand?

  Because you say I cast out demons by Beelzebub.

# Luke 11:19
  And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub,
  by whom do your sons cast them out?

  Therefore they will be your judges.

# Luke 11:20
  But if I cast out demons with the finger of God,
  surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.

# Luke 11:21
  When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace,
  his goods are in peace.

# Luke 11:22
  But when a stronger than he comes upon him and overcomes him,
  he takes from him all his armor in which he trusted,
  and divides his spoils.

# Luke 11:23
  He who is not with Me is against Me,
  and he who does not gather with Me scatters.

# Luke 11:24
  When an unclean spirit goes out of a man,
  he goes through dry places, seeking rest;
  and finding none, he says,
  {
    I will return to my house from which I came.
  }

# Luke 11:25
  And when he comes, he finds it swept and put in order.

# Luke 11:26
  Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits
  more wicked than himself,
  and they enter and dwell there;
  and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
}

# Luke 11:27
And it happened, as He spoke these things,
that a certain woman from the crowd
raised her voice and said to Him,
{
  Blessed is the womb that bore You,
  and the breasts which nursed You!
}

# Luke 11:28
But He said,
{
  More than that,
  blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!
}

# Luke 11:29
And while the crowds were thickly gathered together,
He began to say,
{
  This is an evil generation.

  It seeks a sign,
  and no sign will be given to it
  except the sign of Jonah the prophet.

# Luke 11:30
  For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites,
  so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.

# Luke 11:31
  The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment
  with the men of this generation and condemn them,
  for she came from the ends of the earth
  to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
  and indeed a greater than Solomon is here.

# Luke 11:32
  The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment
  with this generation
  and condemn it,
  for they repented at the preaching of Jonah;
  and indeed a greater than Jonah is here.

# Luke 11:33
  No one, when he has lit a lamp,
  puts it in a secret place or under a basket,
  but on a lampstand,
  that those who come in may see the light.

# Luke 11:34
  The lamp of the body is the eye.

  Therefore, when your eye is good,
  your whole body also is full of light.

  But when your eye is bad,
  your body also is full of darkness.

# Luke 11:35
  Therefore take heed that the light which is in you
  is not darkness.

# Luke 11:36
  If then your whole body is full of light,
  having no part dark,
  the whole body will be full of light,
  as when the bright shining of a lamp gives you light.
}

# Luke 11:37
And as He spoke,
a certain Pharisee asked Him to dine with him.

So He went in and sat down to eat.

# Luke 11:38
When the Pharisee saw it,
he marveled that He had not first washed before dinner.

# Luke 11:39
Then the Lord said to him,
{
  Now you Pharisees make the outside of the cup and dish clean,
  but your inward part is full of greed and wickedness.

# Luke 11:40
  Foolish ones!

  Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?

# Luke 11:41
  But rather give alms of such things as you have;
  then indeed all things are clean to you.

# Luke 11:42
  But woe to you Pharisees!

  For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs,
  and pass by justice and the love of God.

  These you ought to have done,
  without leaving the others undone.

# Luke 11:43
  Woe to you Pharisees!

  For you love the best seats in the synagogues
  and greetings in the marketplaces.

# Luke 11:44
  Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!

  For you are like graves which are not seen,
  and the men who walk over them are not aware of them.
}

# Luke 11:45
Then one of the lawyers answered and said to Him,
{
  Teacher, by saying these things You reproach us also.
}

# Luke 11:46
And He said,
{
  Woe to you also, lawyers!

  For you load men with burdens hard to bear,
  and you yourselves do not touch the burdens
  with one of your fingers.

# Luke 11:47
  Woe to you!

  For you build the tombs of the prophets,
  and your fathers killed them.

# Luke 11:48
  In fact,
  you bear witness that you approve the deeds of your fathers;
  for they indeed killed them,
  and you build their tombs.

# Luke 11:49
  Therefore the wisdom of God also said,
  {
    I will send them prophets and apostles,
    and some of them they will kill and persecute,
  }
# Luke 11:50
  that the blood of all the prophets
  which was shed from the foundation of the world
  may be required of this generation,
# Luke 11:51
  from the blood of Abel
  to the blood of Zechariah
  who perished between the altar and the temple.

  Yes, I say to you, it shall be required of this generation.

# Luke 11:52
  Woe to you lawyers!

  For you have taken away the key of knowledge.

  You did not enter in yourselves,
  and those who were entering in you hindered.
}

# Luke 11:53
And as He said these things to them,
the scribes and the Pharisees began to assail Him vehemently,
and to cross-examine Him about many things,
# Luke 11:54
lying in wait for Him,
and seeking to catch Him in something He might say,
that they might accuse Him.

# Luke 12:1
In the meantime,
when an innumerable multitude of people had gathered together,
so that they trampled one another,
He began to say to His disciples first of all,
{
  Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

# Luke 12:2
  For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed,
  nor hidden that will not be known.

# Luke 12:3
  Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark
  will be heard in the light,
  and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms
  will be proclaimed on the housetops.

# Luke 12:4
  And I say to you, My friends,
  do not be afraid of those who kill the body,
  and after that have no more that they can do.

# Luke 12:5
  But I will show you whom you should fear:
  Fear Him who, after He has killed, has power to cast into hell;
  yes, I say to you, fear Him!

# Luke 12:6
  Are not five sparrows sold for two copper coins?

  And not one of them is forgotten before God.

# Luke 12:7
  But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

  Do not fear therefore;
  you are of more value than many sparrows.

# Luke 12:8
  Also I say to you, whoever confesses Me before men,
  him the Son of Man also will confess before the angels of God.

# Luke 12:9
  But he who denies Me before men
  will be denied before the angels of God.

# Luke 12:10
  And anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man,
  it will be forgiven him;
  but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit,
  it will not be forgiven.

# Luke 12:11
  Now when they bring you
  to the synagogues and magistrates and authorities,
  do not worry about how or what you should answer,
  or what you should say.

# Luke 12:12
  For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour
  what you ought to say.
}

# Luke 12:13
Then one from the crowd said to Him,
{
  Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
}

# Luke 12:14
But He said to him,
{
  Man, who made Me a judge or an arbitrator over you?
}

# Luke 12:15
And He said to them,
{
  Take heed and beware of covetousness,
  for one's life does not consist
  in the abundance of the things he possesses.
}

# Luke 12:16
Then He spoke a parable to them, saying:
{
  The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully.

# Luke 12:17
  And he thought within himself, saying,
  {
    What shall I do, since I have no room to store my crops?
  }

# Luke 12:18
  So he said,
  {
    I will do this:

    I will pull down my barns and build greater,
    and there I will store all my crops and my goods.

# Luke 12:19
    And I will say to my soul,
    {
      Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years;
      take your ease;
      eat, drink, and be merry.
    }
  }

# Luke 12:20
  But God said to him,
  {
    Fool!

    This night your soul will be required of you;
    then whose will those things be which you have provided?
  }

# Luke 12:21
  So is he who lays up treasure for himself,
  and is not rich toward God.
}

# Luke 12:22
Then He said to His disciples,
{
  Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life,
  what you will eat;
  nor about the body,
  what you will put on.

# Luke 12:23
  Life is more than food,
  and the body is more than clothing.

# Luke 12:24
  Consider the ravens,
  for they neither sow nor reap,
  which have neither storehouse nor barn;
  and God feeds them.

  Of how much more value are you than the birds?

# Luke 12:25
  And which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?

# Luke 12:26
  If you then are not able to do the least,
  why are you anxious for the rest?

# Luke 12:27
  Consider the lilies, how they grow:
  they neither toil nor spin;
  and yet I say to you,
  even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.

# Luke 12:28
  If then God so clothes the grass,
  which today is in the field
  and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,
  how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith?

# Luke 12:29
  And do not seek what you should eat or what you should drink,
  nor have an anxious mind.

# Luke 12:30
  For all these things the nations of the world seek after,
  and your Father knows that you need these things.

# Luke 12:31
  But seek the kingdom of God,
  and all these things shall be added to you.

# Luke 12:32
  Do not fear, little flock,
  for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

# Luke 12:33
  Sell what you have and give alms;
  provide yourselves money bags which do not grow old,
  a treasure in the heavens that does not fail,
  where no thief approaches nor moth destroys.

# Luke 12:34
  For where your treasure is,
  there your heart will be also.

# Luke 12:35
  Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning;
# Luke 12:36
  and you yourselves be like men who wait for their master,
  when he will return from the wedding,
  that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately.

# Luke 12:37
  Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes,
  will find watching.

  Assuredly, I say to you
  that he will gird himself and have them sit down to eat,
  and will come and serve them.

# Luke 12:38
  And if he should come in the second watch,
  or come in the third watch,
  and find them so,
  blessed are those servants.

# Luke 12:39
  But know this,
  that if the master of the house had known
  what hour the thief would come,
  he would have watched
  and not allowed his house to be broken into.

# Luke 12:40
  Therefore you also be ready,
  for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.
}

# Luke 12:41
Then Peter said to Him,
{
  Lord, do You speak this parable only to us, or to all people?
}

# Luke 12:42
And the Lord said,
{
  Who then is that faithful and wise steward,
  whom his master will make ruler over his household,
  to give them their portion of food in due season?

# Luke 12:43
  Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing
  when he comes.

# Luke 12:44
  Truly, I say to you
  that he will make him ruler over all that he has.

# Luke 12:45
  But if that servant says in his heart,
  {
    My master is delaying his coming,
  }
  and begins to beat the male and female servants,
  and to eat and drink and be drunk,
# Luke 12:46
  the master of that servant will come on a day
  when he is not looking for him,
  and at an hour when he is not aware,
  and will cut him in two
  and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.

# Luke 12:47
  And that servant who knew his master's will,
  and did not prepare himself or do according to his will,
  shall be beaten with many stripes.

# Luke 12:48
  But he who did not know,
  yet committed things deserving of stripes,
  shall be beaten with few.

  For everyone to whom much is given,
  from him much will be required;
  and to whom much has been committed,
  of him they will ask the more.

# Luke 12:49
  I came to send fire on the earth,
  and how I wish it were already kindled!

# Luke 12:50
  But I have a baptism to be baptized with,
  and how distressed I am till it is accomplished!

# Luke 12:51
  Do you suppose that I came to give peace on earth?

  I tell you, not at all, but rather division.

# Luke 12:52
  For from now on five in one house will be divided:
  three against two, and two against three.

# Luke 12:53
  Father will be divided against son and son against father,
  mother against daughter and daughter against mother,
  mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law
  and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
}

# Luke 12:54
Then He also said to the multitudes,
{
  Whenever you see a cloud rising out of the west,
  immediately you say,
  {
    A shower is coming
  };
  and so it is.

# Luke 12:55
  And when you see the south wind blow, you say,
  {
    There will be hot weather
  };
  and there is.

# Luke 12:56
  Hypocrites!

  You can discern the face of the sky and of the earth,
  but how is it you do not discern this time?

# Luke 12:57
  Yes, and why, even of yourselves,
  do you not judge what is right?

# Luke 12:58
  When you go with your adversary to the magistrate,
  make every effort along the way to settle with him,
  lest he drag you to the judge,
  the judge deliver you to the officer,
  and the officer throw you into prison.

# Luke 12:59
  I tell you,
  you shall not depart from there
  till you have paid the very last mite.
}

# Luke 13:1
There were present at that season
some who told Him about the Galileans
whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.

# Luke 13:2
And Jesus answered and said to them,
{
  Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners
  than all other Galileans,
  because they suffered such things?

# Luke 13:3
  I tell you, no;
  but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.

# Luke 13:4
  Or those 18 on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them,
  do you think that they were worse sinners
  than all other men who dwelt in Jerusalem?

# Luke 13:5
  I tell you, no;
  but unless you repent you will all likewise perish.
}

# Luke 13:6
He also spoke this parable:
{
  A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard,
  and he came seeking fruit on it and found none.

# Luke 13:7
  Then he said to the keeper of his vineyard,
  {
    Look, for three years
    I have come seeking fruit on this fig tree
    and find none.

    Cut it down; why does it use up the ground?
  }

# Luke 13:8
  But he answered and said to him,
  {
    Sir, let it alone this year also,
    until I dig around it and fertilize it.

# Luke 13:9
    And if it bears fruit, well.

    But if not, after that you can cut it down.
  }
}

# Luke 13:10
Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.

# Luke 13:11
And behold,
there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity 18 years,
and was bent over and could in no way raise herself up.

# Luke 13:12
But when Jesus saw her, He called her to Him and said to her,
{
  Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity.
}

# Luke 13:13
And He laid His hands on her,
and immediately she was made straight,
and glorified God.

# Luke 13:14
But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,
because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath;
and he said to the crowd,
{
  There are six days on which men ought to work;
  therefore come and be healed on them,
  and not on the Sabbath day.
}

# Luke 13:15
The Lord then answered him and said,
{
  Hypocrite!

  Does not each one of you on the Sabbath
  loose his ox or donkey from the stall,
  and lead it away to water it?

# Luke 13:16
  So ought not this woman,
  being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound --
  think of it -- or 18 years,
  be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?
}

# Luke 13:17
And when He said these things,
all His adversaries were put to shame;
and all the multitude rejoiced
for all the glorious things that were done by Him.

# Luke 13:18
Then He said,
{
  What is the kingdom of God like?

  And to what shall I compare it?

# Luke 13:19
  It is like a mustard seed,
  which a man took and put in his garden;
  and it grew and became a large tree,
  and the birds of the air nested in its branches.
}

# Luke 13:20
And again He said,
{
  To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?

# Luke 13:21
  It is like leaven,
  which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal
  till it was all leavened.
}

# Luke 13:22
And He went through the cities and villages, teaching,
and journeying toward Jerusalem.

# Luke 13:23
Then one said to Him,
{
  Lord, are there few who are saved?
}

And He said to them,
{
# Luke 13:24
  Strive to enter through the narrow gate,
  for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able.

# Luke 13:25
  When once the Master of the house
  has risen up and shut the door,
  and you begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying,
  {
    Lord, Lord, open for us,
  }
  and He will answer and say to you,
  {
    I do not know you, where you are from,
  }
# Luke 13:26
  then you will begin to say,
  {
    We ate and drank in Your presence,
    and You taught in our streets.
  }

# Luke 13:27
  But He will say,
  {
    I tell you I do not know you, where you are from.

    Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.
  }

# Luke 13:28
  There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,
  when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
  and all the prophets in the kingdom of God,
  and yourselves thrust out.

# Luke 13:29
  They will come from the east and the west,
  from the north and the south,
  and sit down in the kingdom of God.

# Luke 13:30
  And indeed there are last who will be first,
  and there are first who will be last.
}

# Luke 13:31
On that very day some Pharisees came,
saying to Him,
{
  Get out and depart from here,
  for Herod wants to kill You.
}

# Luke 13:32
And He said to them,
{
  Go, tell that fox,
  {
    Behold,
    I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow,
    and the third day I shall be perfected.
  }

# Luke 13:33
  Nevertheless I must journey today,
  tomorrow,
  and the day following;
  for it cannot be
  that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.

# Luke 13:34
  O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
  the one who kills the prophets
  and stones those who are sent to her!

  How often I wanted to gather your children together,
  as a hen gathers her brood under her wings,
  but you were not willing!

# Luke 13:35
  See!

  Your house is left to you desolate;
  and assuredly, I say to you,
  you shall not see Me until the time comes when you say,
  {
    Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!
  }
}

# Luke 14:1
Now it happened,
as He went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees
to eat bread on the Sabbath,
that they watched Him closely.

# Luke 14:2
And behold, there was a certain man before Him who had dropsy.

# Luke 14:3
And Jesus, answering, spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying,
{
  Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?
}

# Luke 14:4
But they kept silent.

And He took him and healed him, and let him go.

# Luke 14:5
Then He answered them, saying,
{
  Which of you,
  having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit,
  will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?
}

# Luke 14:6
And they could not answer Him regarding these things.

# Luke 14:7
So He told a parable to those who were invited,
when He noted how they chose the best places,
saying to them:
{
# Luke 14:8
  When you are invited by anyone to a wedding feast,
  do not sit down in the best place,
  lest one more honorable than you be invited by him;
# Luke 14:9
  and he who invited you and him come and say to you,
  {
    Give place to this man,
  }
  and then you begin with shame to take the lowest place.

# Luke 14:10
  But when you are invited,
  go and sit down in the lowest place,
  so that when he who invited you comes he may say to you,
  {
    Friend, go up higher.
  }

  Then you will have glory
  in the presence of those who sit at the table with you.

# Luke 14:11
  For whoever exalts himself will be humbled,
  and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
}

# Luke 14:12
Then He also said to him who invited Him,
{
  When you give a dinner or a supper,
  do not ask your friends,
  your brothers,
  your relatives,
  nor rich neighbors,
  lest they also invite you back,
  and you be repaid.

# Luke 14:13
  But when you give a feast,
  invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.

# Luke 14:14
  And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you;
  for you shall be repaid at the resurrection of the just.
}

# Luke 14:15
Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him
heard these things,
he said to Him,
{
  Blessed is he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God!
}

# Luke 14:16
Then He said to him,
{
  A certain man gave a great supper and invited many,
# Luke 14:17
  and sent his servant at supper time
  to say to those who were invited,
  {
    Come, for all things are now ready.
  }

# Luke 14:18
  But they all with one accord began to make excuses.

  The first said to him,
  {
    I have bought a piece of ground,
    and I must go and see it.

    I ask you to have me excused.
  }

# Luke 14:19
  And another said,
  {
    I have bought five yoke of oxen,
    and I am going to test them.

    I ask you to have me excused.
  }

# Luke 14:20
  Still another said,
  {
    I have married a wife,
    and therefore I cannot come.
  }

# Luke 14:21
  So that servant came and reported these things to his master.

  Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant,
  {
    Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city,
    and bring in here the poor
    and the maimed
    and the lame
    and the blind.
  }

# Luke 14:22
  And the servant said,
  {
    Master, it is done as you commanded,
    and still there is room.
  }

# Luke 14:23
  Then the master said to the servant,
  {
    Go out into the highways and hedges,
    and compel them to come in,
    that my house may be filled.

# Luke 14:24
    For I say to you that none of those men who were invited
    shall taste my supper.
  }
}

# Luke 14:25
Now great multitudes went with Him.

And He turned and said to them,
{
  If anyone comes to Me
  and does not hate
  his father and mother,
  wife and children,
  brothers and sisters,
  yes, and his own life also,
  he cannot be My disciple.

# Luke 14:26
  And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me
  cannot be My disciple.

# Luke 14:27
  For which of you, intending to build a tower,
  does not sit down first and count the cost,
  whether he has enough to finish it --
# Luke 14:28
  lest, after he has laid the foundation,
  and is not able to finish,
  all who see it begin to mock him,
# Luke 14:29
  saying,
  {
    This man began to build and was not able to finish.
  }

# Luke 14:30
  Or what king, going to make war against another king,
  does not sit down first
  and consider whether he is able with 10,000
  to meet him who comes against him with 20,000?

# Luke 14:31
  Or else, while the other is still a great way off,
  he sends a delegation
  and asks conditions of peace.

# Luke 14:32
  So likewise,
  whoever of you does not forsake all that he has
  cannot be My disciple.

# Luke 14:33
  Salt is good;
  but if the salt has lost its flavor,
  how shall it be seasoned?

# Luke 14:34
  It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill,
  but men throw it out.

  He who has ears to hear, let him hear!
}

# Luke 15:1
Then all the tax collectors and the sinners drew near to Him
to hear Him.

# Luke 15:2
And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying,
{
  This Man receives sinners and eats with them.
}

# Luke 15:3
So He spoke this parable to them, saying:
{
# Luke 15:4
  What man of you,
  having 100 sheep,
  if he loses one of them,
  does not leave the 99 in the wilderness,
  and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?

# Luke 15:5
  And when he has found it,
  he lays it on his shoulders,
  rejoicing.

# Luke 15:6
  And when he comes home,
  he calls together his friends and neighbors,
  saying to them,
  {
    Rejoice with me,
    for I have found my sheep which was lost!
  }

# Luke 15:7
  I say to you that likewise
  there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents
  than over 99 just persons who need no repentance.

# Luke 15:8
  Or what woman,
  having 10 silver coins,
  if she loses one coin,
  does not light a lamp,
  sweep the house,
  and search carefully until she finds it?

# Luke 15:9
  And when she has found it,
  she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying,
  {
    Rejoice with me,
    for I have found the piece which I lost!
  }

# Luke 15:10
  Likewise, I say to you,
  there is joy in the presence of the angels of God
  over one sinner who repents.
}

# Luke 15:11
Then He said:
{
  A certain man had two sons.

# Luke 15:12
  And the younger of them said to his father,
  {
    Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me.
  }

  So he divided to them his livelihood.

# Luke 15:13
  And not many days after,
  the younger son gathered all together,
  journeyed to a far country,
  and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.

# Luke 15:14
  But when he had spent all,
  there arose a severe famine in that land,
  and he began to be in want.

# Luke 15:15
  Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country,
  and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.

# Luke 15:16
  And he would gladly have filled his stomach
  with the pods that the swine ate,
  and no one gave him anything.

# Luke 15:17
  But when he came to himself, he said,
  {
    How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough
    and to spare,
    and I perish with hunger!

# Luke 15:18
    I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him,
    {
      Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,
# Luke 15:19
      and I am no longer worthy to be called your son.

      Make me like one of your hired servants.
    }
  }

# Luke 15:20
  And he arose and came to his father.

  But when he was still a great way off,
  his father saw him and had compassion,
  and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.

# Luke 15:21
  And the son said to him,
  {
    Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight,
    and am no longer worthy to be called your son.
  }

# Luke 15:22
  But the father said to his servants,
  {
    Bring out the best robe and put it on him,
    and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.

# Luke 15:23
    And bring the fatted calf here and kill it,
    and let us eat and be merry;
# Luke 15:24
    for this my son was dead and is alive again;
    he was lost and is found.
  }

  And they began to be merry.

# Luke 15:25
  Now his older son was in the field.

  And as he came and drew near to the house,
  he heard music and dancing.

# Luke 15:26
  So he called one of the servants
  and asked what these things meant.

# Luke 15:27
  And he said to him,
  {
    Your brother has come,
    and because he has received him safe and sound,
    your father has killed the fatted calf.
  }

# Luke 15:28
  But he was angry and would not go in.

  Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him.

# Luke 15:29
  So he answered and said to his father,
  {
    Lo, these many years I have been serving you;
    I never transgressed your commandment at any time;
    and yet you never gave me a young goat,
    that I might make merry with my friends.

# Luke 15:30
    But as soon as this son of yours came,
    who has devoured your livelihood with harlots,
    you killed the fatted calf for him.
  }

# Luke 15:31
  And he said to him,
  {
    Son, you are always with me,
    and all that I have is yours.

# Luke 15:32
    It was right that we should make merry and be glad,
    for your brother was dead and is alive again,
    and was lost and is found.
  }
}

# Luke 16:1
He also said to His disciples:
{
  There was a certain rich man who had a steward,
  and an accusation was brought to him
  that this man was wasting his goods.

# Luke 16:2
  So he called him and said to him,
  {
    What is this I hear about you?

    Give an account of your stewardship,
    for you can no longer be steward.
  }

# Luke 16:3
  Then the steward said within himself,
  {
    What shall I do?

    For my master is taking the stewardship away from me.

    I cannot dig;
    I am ashamed to beg.

# Luke 16:4
    I have resolved what to do,
    that when I am put out of the stewardship,
    they may receive me into their houses.
  }

# Luke 16:5
  So he called every one of his master's debtors to him,
  and said to the first,
  {
    How much do you owe my master?
  }

# Luke 16:6
  And he said,
  {
    A 100 measures of oil.
  }

  So he said to him,
  {
    Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write 50.
  }

# Luke 16:7
  Then he said to another,
  {
    And how much do you owe?
  }

  So he said,
  {
    A 100 measures of wheat.
  }

  And he said to him,
  {
    Take your bill, and write 80.
  }

# Luke 16:8
  So the master commended the unjust steward
  because he had dealt shrewdly.

  For the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation
  than the sons of light.

# Luke 16:9
  And I say to you,
  make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon,
  that when you fail,
  they may receive you into an everlasting home.

# Luke 16:10
  He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much;
  and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much.

# Luke 16:11
  Therefore if you have not been faithful
  in the unrighteous mammon,
  who will commit to your trust the true riches?

# Luke 16:12
  And if you have not been faithful in what is another man's,
  who will give you what is your own?

# Luke 16:13
  No servant can serve two masters;
  for either he will hate the one and love the other,
  or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other.

  You cannot serve God and mammon.
}

# Luke 16:14
Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money,
also heard all these things, and they derided Him.

# Luke 16:15
And He said to them,
{
  You are those who justify yourselves before men,
  but God knows your hearts.

  For what is highly esteemed among men
  is an abomination in the sight of God.

# Luke 16:16
  The law and the prophets were until John.

  Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached,
  and everyone is pressing into it.

# Luke 16:17
  And it is easier
  for heaven and earth to pass away
  than for one tittle of the law to fail.

# Luke 16:18
  Whoever divorces his wife and marries another
  commits adultery;
  and whoever marries her who is divorced from her husband
  commits adultery.

# Luke 16:19
  There was a certain rich man
  who was clothed in purple and fine linen
  and fared sumptuously every day.

# Luke 16:20
  But there was a certain beggar named Lazarus,
  full of sores,
  who was laid at his gate,
# Luke 16:21
  desiring to be fed with the crumbs
  which fell from the rich man's table.

  Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.

# Luke 16:22
  So it was that the beggar died,
  and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom.

  The rich man also died and was buried.

# Luke 16:23
  And being in torments in Hades,
  he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off,
  and Lazarus in his bosom.

# Luke 16:24
  Then he cried and said,
  {
    Father Abraham, have mercy on me,
    and send Lazarus
    that he may dip the tip of his finger in water
    and cool my tongue;
    for I am tormented in this flame.
  }

# Luke 16:25
  But Abraham said,
  {
    Son, remember that in your lifetime
    you received your good things,
    and likewise Lazarus evil things;
    but now he is comforted and you are tormented.

# Luke 16:26
    And besides all this,
    between us and you there is a great gulf fixed,
    so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot,
    nor can those from there pass to us.
  }

# Luke 16:27
  Then he said,
  {
    I beg you therefore, father,
    that you would send him to my father's house,
# Luke 16:28
    for I have five brothers,
    that he may testify to them,
    lest they also come to this place of torment.
  }

# Luke 16:29
  Abraham said to him,
  {
    They have Moses and the prophets;
    let them hear them.
  }

# Luke 16:30
  And he said,
  {
    No, father Abraham;
    but if one goes to them from the dead,
    they will repent.
  }

# Luke 16:31
  But he said to him,
  {
    If they do not hear Moses and the prophets,
    neither will they be persuaded though one rise from the dead.
  }
}

# Luke 17:1
Then He said to the disciples,
{
  It is impossible that no offenses should come,
  but woe to him through whom they do come!

# Luke 17:2
  It would be better for him
  if a millstone were hung around his neck,
  and he were thrown into the sea,
  than that he should offend one of these little ones.

# Luke 17:3
  Take heed to yourselves.

  If your brother sins against you, rebuke him;
  and if he repents, forgive him.

# Luke 17:4
  And if he sins against you seven times in a day,
  and seven times in a day returns to you, saying,
  {
    I repent,
  }
  you shall forgive him.
}

# Luke 17:5
And the apostles said to the Lord,
{
  Increase our faith.
}

# Luke 17:6
So the Lord said,
{
  If you have faith as a mustard seed,
  you can say to this mulberry tree,
  {
    Be pulled up by the roots and be planted in the sea,
  }
  and it would obey you.

# Luke 17:7
  And which of you,
  having a servant plowing or tending sheep,
  will say to him when he has come in from the field,
  {
    Come at once and sit down to eat
  }?

# Luke 17:8
  But will he not rather say to him,
  {
    Prepare something for my supper,
    and gird yourself and serve me till I have eaten and drunk,
    and afterward you will eat and drink
  }?

# Luke 17:9
  Does he thank that servant
  because he did the things that were commanded him?

  I think not.

# Luke 17:10
  So likewise you,
  when you have done all those things
  which you are commanded,
  say,
  {
    We are unprofitable servants.

    We have done what was our duty to do.
  }
}

# Luke 17:11
Now it happened as He went to Jerusalem
that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.

# Luke 17:12
Then as He entered a certain village,
there met Him 10 men who were lepers,
who stood afar off.

# Luke 17:13
And they lifted up their voices and said,
{
  Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!
}

# Luke 17:14
So when He saw them,
He said to them,
{
  Go, show yourselves to the priests.
}

And so it was that as they went,
they were cleansed.

# Luke 17:15
And one of them,
when he saw that he was healed, returned,
and with a loud voice glorified God,
# Luke 17:16
and fell down on his face at His feet,
giving Him thanks.

And he was a Samaritan.

# Luke 17:17
So Jesus answered and said,
{
  Were there not 10 cleansed?

  But where are the nine?

# Luke 17:18
  Were there not any found who returned to give glory to God
  except this foreigner?
}

# Luke 17:19
And He said to him,
{
  Arise, go your way.

  Your faith has made you well.
}

# Luke 17:20
Now when He was asked by the Pharisees
when the kingdom of God would come,
He answered them and said,
{
  The kingdom of God
  does not come with observation;
# Luke 17:21
  nor will they say,
  {
    See here!
  }
  or
  {
    See there!
  }

  For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you.
}

# Luke 17:22
Then He said to the disciples,
{
  The days will come when you will desire to see
  one of the days of the Son of Man,
  and you will not see it.

# Luke 17:23
  And they will say to you,
  {
    Look here!
  }
  or
  {
    Look there!
  }

  Do not go after them or follow them.

# Luke 17:24
  For as the lightning that flashes out of one part under heaven
  shines to the other part under heaven,
  so also the Son of Man will be in His day.

# Luke 17:25
  But first He must suffer many things
  and be rejected by this generation.

# Luke 17:26
  And as it was in the days of Noah,
  so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man:

# Luke 17:27
  They ate,
  they drank,
  they married wives,
  they were given in marriage,
  until the day that Noah entered the ark,
  and the flood came and destroyed them all.

# Luke 17:28
  Likewise as it was also in the days of Lot:
  They ate,
  they drank,
  they bought,
  they sold,
  they planted,
  they built;
# Luke 17:29
  but on the day that Lot went out of Sodom
  it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.

# Luke 17:30
  Even so will it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.

# Luke 17:31
  In that day, he who is on the housetop,
  and his goods are in the house,
  let him not come down to take them away.

  And likewise the one who is in the field,
  let him not turn back.

# Luke 17:32
  Remember Lot's wife.

# Luke 17:33
  Whoever seeks to save his life will lose it,
  and whoever loses his life will preserve it.

# Luke 17:34
  I tell you,
  in that night there will be two men in one bed:
  the one will be taken and the other will be left.

# Luke 17:35
  Two women will be grinding together:
  the one will be taken and the other left.

# Luke 17:36
  Two men will be in the field:
  the one will be taken and the other left.
}

# Luke 17:37
And they answered and said to Him,
{
  Where, Lord?
}

So He said to them,
{
  Wherever the body is,
  there the eagles will be gathered together.
}

# Luke 18:1
Then He spoke a parable to them,
that men always ought to pray
and not lose heart,
# Luke 18:2
saying:
{
  There was in a certain city a judge
  who did not fear God nor regard man.

# Luke 18:3
  Now there was a widow in that city;
  and she came to him, saying,
  {
    Get justice for me from my adversary.
  }

# Luke 18:4
  And he would not for a while;
  but afterward he said within himself,
  {
    Though I do not fear God nor regard man,
# Luke 18:5
    yet because this widow troubles me I will avenge her,
    lest by her continual coming she weary me.
  }
}

# Luke 18:6
Then the Lord said,
{
  Hear what the unjust judge said.

# Luke 18:7
  And shall God not avenge His own elect
  who cry out day and night to Him,
  though He bears long with them?

# Luke 18:8
  I tell you that He will avenge them speedily.

  Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes,
  will He really find faith on the earth?
}

# Luke 18:9
Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves
that they were righteous, and despised others:
{
# Luke 18:10
  Two men went up to the temple to pray,
  one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.

# Luke 18:11
  The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself,
  {
    God, I thank You that I am not like other men --
    extortioners,
    unjust,
    adulterers,
    or even as this tax collector.

# Luke 18:12
    I fast twice a week;
    I give tithes of all that I possess.
  }

# Luke 18:13
  And the tax collector,
  standing afar off,
  would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven,
  but beat his breast, saying,
  {
    God, be merciful to me a sinner!
  }

# Luke 18:14
  I tell you,
  this man went down to his house justified rather than the other;
  for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,
  and he who humbles himself will be exalted.
}

# Luke 18:15
Then they also brought infants to Him that He might touch them;
but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.

# Luke 18:16
But Jesus called them to Him and said,
{
  Let the little children come to Me,
  and do not forbid them;
  for of such is the kingdom of God.

# Luke 18:17
  Assuredly, I say to you,
  whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child
  will by no means enter it.
}

# Luke 18:18
Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying,
{
  Good Teacher,
  what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
}

# Luke 18:19
So Jesus said to him,
{
  Why do you call Me good?

  No one is good but One, that is, God.

# Luke 18:20
  You know the commandments:
  {
    Do not commit adultery,
  }

  {
    Do not murder,
  }

  {
    Do not steal,
  }

  {
    Do not bear false witness,
  }

  {
    Honor your father and your mother.
  }
}

# Luke 18:21
And he said,
{
  All these things I have kept from my youth.
}

# Luke 18:22
So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him,
{
  You still lack one thing.

  Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor,
  and you will have treasure in heaven;
  and come, follow Me.
}

# Luke 18:23
But when he heard this,
he became very sorrowful,
for he was very rich.

# Luke 18:24
And when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful,
He said,
{
  How hard it is for those who have riches
  to enter the kingdom of God!

# Luke 18:25
  For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
  than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
}

# Luke 18:26
And those who heard it said,
{
  Who then can be saved?
}

# Luke 18:27
But He said,
{
  The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
}

# Luke 18:28
Then Peter said,
{
  See, we have left all and followed You.
}

# Luke 18:29
So He said to them,
{
  Assuredly, I say to you,
  there is no one who has left house
  or parents
  or brothers
  or wife
  or children,
  for the sake of the kingdom of God,
# Luke 18:30
  who shall not receive many times more in this present time,
  and in the age to come eternal life.
}

# Luke 18:31
Then He took the twelve aside and said to them,
{
  Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem,
  and all things that are written by the prophets
  concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.

# Luke 18:32
  For He will be delivered to the Gentiles
  and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.

# Luke 18:33
  They will scourge Him and kill Him.

  And the third day He will rise again.
}

# Luke 18:34
But they understood none of these things;
this saying was hidden from them,
and they did not know the things which were spoken.

# Luke 18:35
Then it happened, as He was coming near Jericho,
that a certain blind man sat by the road begging.

# Luke 18:36
And hearing a multitude passing by,
he asked what it meant.

# Luke 18:37
So they told him that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.

# Luke 18:38
And he cried out, saying,
{
  Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!
}

# Luke 18:39
Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet;
but he cried out all the more,
{
  Son of David, have mercy on me!
}

# Luke 18:40
So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be brought to Him.

And when he had come near,
He asked him,
# Luke 18:41
saying,
{
  What do you want Me to do for you?
}

He said,
{
  Lord, that I may receive my sight.
}

# Luke 18:42
Then Jesus said to him,
{
  Receive your sight;
  your faith has made you well.
}

# Luke 18:43
And immediately he received his sight,
and followed Him,
glorifying God.

And all the people,
when they saw it,
gave praise to God.

# Luke 19:1
Then Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.

# Luke 19:2
Now behold,
there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector,
and he was rich.

# Luke 19:3
And he sought to see who Jesus was,
but could not because of the crowd,
for he was of short stature.

# Luke 19:4
So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him,
for He was going to pass that way.

# Luke 19:5
And when Jesus came to the place,
He looked up and saw him,
and said to him,
{
  Zacchaeus, make haste and come down,
  for today I must stay at your house.
}

# Luke 19:6
So he made haste and came down,
and received Him joyfully.

# Luke 19:7
But when they saw it,
they all complained, saying,
{
  He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.
}

# Luke 19:8
Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord,
{
  Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor;
  and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation,
  I restore fourfold.
}

# Luke 19:9
And Jesus said to him,
{
  Today salvation has come to this house,
  because he also is a son of Abraham;
# Luke 19:10
  for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save
  that which was lost.
}

# Luke 19:11
Now as they heard these things,
He spoke another parable,
because He was near Jerusalem
and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear
immediately.

# Luke 19:12
Therefore He said:
{
  A certain nobleman went into a far country
  to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.

# Luke 19:13
  So he called 10 of his servants,
  delivered to them 10 minas,
  and said to them, "Do business till I come."

# Luke 19:14
  But his citizens hated him,
  and sent a delegation after him, saying,
  {
    We will not have this man to reign over us.
  }

# Luke 19:15
  And so it was that when he returned,
  having received the kingdom,
  he then commanded these servants,
  to whom he had given the money,
  to be called to him,
  that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.

# Luke 19:16
  Then came the first, saying,
  {
    Master, your mina has earned 10 minas.
  }

# Luke 19:17
  And he said to him,
  {
    Well done, good servant;
    because you were faithful in a very little,
    have authority over 10 cities.
  }

# Luke 19:18
  And the second came, saying,
  {
    Master, your mina has earned five minas.
  }

# Luke 19:19
  Likewise he said to him,
  {
    You also be over five cities.
  }

# Luke 19:20
  Then another came, saying,
  {
    Master, here is your mina,
    which I have kept put away in a handkerchief.

# Luke 19:21
    For I feared you,
    because you are an austere man.

    You collect what you did not deposit,
    and reap what you did not sow.
  }

# Luke 19:22
  And he said to him,
  {
    Out of your own mouth I will judge you,
    you wicked servant.

    You knew that I was an austere man,
    collecting what I did not deposit
    and reaping what I did not sow.

# Luke 19:23
    Why then did you not put my money in the bank,
    that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?
  }

# Luke 19:24
  And he said to those who stood by,
  {
    Take the mina from him,
    and give it to him who has 10 minas.
  }

  (
# Luke 19:25
    But they said to him,
    {
      Master, he has 10 minas.
    }
  )

  {
# Luke 19:26
    For I say to you,
    that to everyone who has will be given;
    and from him who does not have,
    even what he has will be taken away from him.

# Luke 19:27
    But bring here those enemies of mine,
    who did not want me to reign over them,
    and slay them before me.
  }
}

# Luke 19:28
When He had said this,
He went on ahead,
going up to Jerusalem.

# Luke 19:29
And it came to pass,
when He came near to Bethphage and Bethany,
at the mountain called Olivet,
that He sent two of His disciples,
# Luke 19:30
saying,
{
  Go into the village opposite you,
  where as you enter you will find a colt tied,
  on which no one has ever sat.

  Loose it and bring it here.

# Luke 19:31
  And if anyone asks you,
  {
    Why are you loosing it?
  }
  thus you shall say to him,
  {
    Because the Lord has need of it.
  }
}

# Luke 19:32
So those who were sent went their way
and found it just as He had said to them.

# Luke 19:33
But as they were loosing the colt,
the owners of it said to them,
{
  Why are you loosing the colt?
}

# Luke 19:34
And they said,
{
  The Lord has need of him.
}

# Luke 19:35
Then they brought him to Jesus.

And they threw their own clothes on the colt,
and they set Jesus on him.

# Luke 19:36
And as He went, many spread their clothes on the road.

# Luke 19:37
Then,
as He was now drawing near
the descent of the Mount of Olives,
the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice
and praise God with a loud voice
for all the mighty works they had seen,
# Luke 19:38
saying:
{
  {
    Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!
  }

  Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!
}

# Luke 19:39
And some of the Pharisees called to Him from the crowd,
{
  Teacher, rebuke Your disciples.
}

# Luke 19:40
But He answered and said to them,
{
  I tell you that if these should keep silent,
  the stones would immediately cry out.
}

# Luke 19:41
Now as He drew near,
He saw the city and wept over it,
# Luke 19:42
saying,
{
  If you had known, even you,
  especially in this your day,
  the things that make for your peace!

  But now they are hidden from your eyes.

# Luke 19:43
  For days will come upon you
  when your enemies will build an embankment around you,
  surround you and close you in on every side,
# Luke 19:44
  and level you, and your children within you, to the ground;
  and they will not leave in you one stone upon another,
  because you did not know the time of your visitation.
}

# Luke 19:45
Then He went into the temple
and began to drive out those who bought and sold in it,
# Luke 19:46
saying to them,
{
  It is written,
  {
    My house is a house of prayer,
  }
  but you have made it a
  {
    den of thieves.
  }
}

# Luke 19:47
And He was teaching daily in the temple.

But the chief priests,
the scribes,
and the leaders of the people sought to destroy Him,
# Luke 19:48
and were unable to do anything;
for all the people were very attentive to hear Him.

# Luke 20:1
Now it happened on one of those days,
as He taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel,
that the chief priests and the scribes,
together with the elders,
confronted Him
# Luke 20:2
and spoke to Him, saying,
{
  Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things?

  Or who is he who gave You this authority?
}

# Luke 20:3
But He answered and said to them,
{
  I also will ask you one thing, and answer Me:

# Luke 20:4
  The baptism of John --
  was it from heaven or from men?
}

# Luke 20:5
And they reasoned among themselves, saying,
{
  If we say,
  {
    From heaven,
  }
  He will say,
  {
    Why then did you not believe him?
  }

# Luke 20:6
  But if we say,
  {
    From men,
  }
  all the people will stone us,
  for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
}

# Luke 20:7
So they answered that they did not know where it was from.

# Luke 20:8
And Jesus said to them,
{
  Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.
}

# Luke 20:9
Then He began to tell the people this parable:
{
  A certain man planted a vineyard,
  leased it to vinedressers,
  and went into a far country
  for a long time.

# Luke 20:10
  Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the vinedressers,
  that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard.

  But the vinedressers beat him
  and sent him away empty-handed.

# Luke 20:11
  Again he sent another servant;
  and they beat him also,
  treated him shamefully,
  and sent him away empty-handed.

# Luke 20:12
  And again he sent a third;
  and they wounded him also and cast him out.

# Luke 20:13
  Then the owner of the vineyard said,
  {
    What shall I do?

    I will send my beloved son.

    Probably they will respect him when they see him.
  }

# Luke 20:14
  But when the vinedressers saw him,
  they reasoned among themselves, saying,
  {
    This is the heir.

    Come, let us kill him,
    that the inheritance may be ours.
  }

# Luke 20:15
  So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.

  Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?

# Luke 20:16
  He will come and destroy those vinedressers
  and give the vineyard to others.
}

And when they heard it they said,
{
  Certainly not!
}

# Luke 20:17
Then He looked at them and said,
{
  What then is this that is written:
  {
    The stone which the builders rejected
    Has become the chief cornerstone
  }?

# Luke 20:18
  Whoever falls on that stone will be broken;
  but on whomever it falls,
  it will grind him to powder.
}

# Luke 20:19
And the chief priests and the scribes
that very hour sought to lay hands on Him,
but they feared the people --
for they knew He had spoken this parable against them.

# Luke 20:20
So they watched Him,
and sent spies who pretended to be righteous,
that they might seize on His words,
in order to deliver Him
to the power and the authority of the governor.

# Luke 20:21
Then they asked Him, saying,
{
  Teacher,
  we know that You say and teach rightly,
  and You do not show personal favoritism,
  but teach the way of God in truth:

# Luke 20:22
  Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
}

# Luke 20:23
But He perceived their craftiness, and said to them,
{
  Why do you test Me?

# Luke 20:24
  Show Me a denarius.

  Whose image and inscription does it have?
}

They answered and said,
{
  Caesar's.
}

# Luke 20:25
And He said to them,
{
  Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,
  and to God the things that are God's.
}

# Luke 20:26
But they could not catch Him
in His words
in the presence of the people.

And they marveled at His answer and kept silent.

# Luke 20:27
Then some of the Sadducees,
who deny that there is a resurrection,
came to Him and asked Him,
# Luke 20:28
saying:
{
  Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies,
  having a wife,
  and he dies without children,
  his brother should take his wife
  and raise up offspring for his brother.

# Luke 20:29
  Now there were seven brothers.

  And the first took a wife,
  and died without children.

# Luke 20:30
  And the second took her as wife,
  and he died childless.

# Luke 20:31
  Then the third took her,
  and in like manner the seven also;
  and they left no children,
  and died.

# Luke 20:32
  Last of all the woman died also.

# Luke 20:33
  Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife does she become?

  For all seven had her as wife.
}

# Luke 20:34
And Jesus answered and said to them,
{
  The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.

# Luke 20:35
  But those who are counted worthy to attain that age,
  and the resurrection from the dead,
  neither marry nor are given in marriage;
# Luke 20:36
  nor can they die anymore,
  for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God,
  being sons of the resurrection.

# Luke 20:37
  But even Moses showed in the burning bush passage
  that the dead are raised,
  when he called the Lord
  {
    the God of Abraham,
    the God of Isaac,
    and the God of Jacob.
  }

# Luke 20:38
  For He is not the God of the dead but of the living,
  for all live to Him.
}

# Luke 20:39
Then some of the scribes answered and said,
{
  Teacher, You have spoken well.
}

# Luke 20:40
But after that they dared not question Him anymore.

# Luke 20:41
And He said to them,
{
  How can they say that the Christ is the Son of David?

# Luke 20:42
  Now David himself said in the Book of Psalms:
  {
    The Lord said to my Lord,
    {
      Sit at My right hand,

# Luke 20:43
      Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.
    }
  }

# Luke 20:44
  Therefore David calls Him "Lord";
  how is He then his Son?
}

# Luke 20:45
Then, in the hearing of all the people,
He said to His disciples,
{
# Luke 20:46
  Beware of the scribes,
  who desire to go around in long robes,
  love greetings in the marketplaces,
  the best seats in the synagogues,
  and the best places at feasts,
# Luke 20:47
  who devour widows' houses,
  and for a pretense make long prayers.

  These will receive greater condemnation.
}

# Luke 21:1
And He looked up
and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,
# Luke 21:2
and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.

# Luke 21:3
So He said,
{
  Truly I say to you
  that this poor widow has put in more than all;
# Luke 21:4
  for all these out of their abundance
  have put in offerings for God,
  but she out of her poverty
  put in all the livelihood that she had.
}

# Luke 21:5
Then, as some spoke of the temple,
how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations,
He said,
{
# Luke 21:6
  These things which you see --
  the days will come
  in which not one stone shall be left upon another
  that shall not be thrown down.
}

# Luke 21:7
So they asked Him, saying,
{
  Teacher, but when will these things be?

  And what sign will there be
  when these things are about to take place?
}

# Luke 21:8
And He said:
{
  Take heed that you not be deceived.

  For many will come in My name, saying,
  {
    I am He,
  }
  and,
  {
    The time has drawn near.
  }

  Therefore do not go after them.

# Luke 21:9
  But when you hear of wars and commotions,
  do not be terrified;
  for these things must come to pass first,
  but the end will not come immediately.
}

# Luke 21:10
Then He said to them,
{
  Nation will rise against nation,
  and kingdom against kingdom.

# Luke 21:11
  And there will be great earthquakes in various places,
  and famines and pestilences;
  and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.

# Luke 21:12
  But before all these things,
  they will lay their hands on you and persecute you,
  delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons.

  You will be brought before kings and rulers for My name's sake.

# Luke 21:13
  But it will turn out for you as an occasion for testimony.

# Luke 21:14
  Therefore settle it in your hearts
  not to meditate beforehand
  on what you will answer;
# Luke 21:15
  for I will give you a mouth and wisdom
  which all your adversaries
  will not be able to contradict or resist.

# Luke 21:16
  You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers,
  relatives and friends;
  and they will put some of you to death.

# Luke 21:17
  And you will be hated by all for My name's sake.

# Luke 21:18
  But not a hair of your head shall be lost.

# Luke 21:19
  By your patience possess your souls.

# Luke 21:20
  But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies,
  then know that its desolation is near.

# Luke 21:21
  Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,
  let those who are in the midst of her depart,
  and let not those who are in the country enter her.

# Luke 21:22
  For these are the days of vengeance,
  that all things which are written may be fulfilled.

# Luke 21:23
  But woe to those who are pregnant
  and to those who are nursing babies in those days!

  For there will be great distress in the land
  and wrath upon this people.

# Luke 21:24
  And they will fall by the edge of the sword,
  and be led away captive into all nations.

  And Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles
  until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

# Luke 21:25
  And there will be signs in the sun,
  in the moon,
  and in the stars;
  and on the earth distress of nations,
  with perplexity,
  the sea and the waves roaring;
# Luke 21:26
  men's hearts failing them from fear
  and the expectation
  of those things which are coming on the earth,
  for the powers of heaven will be shaken.

# Luke 21:27
  Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud
  with power and great glory.

# Luke 21:28
  Now when these things begin to happen,
  look up and lift up your heads,
  because your redemption draws near.
}

# Luke 21:29
Then He spoke to them a parable:
{
  Look at the fig tree,
  and all the trees.

# Luke 21:30
  When they are already budding,
  you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near.

# Luke 21:31
  So you also, when you see these things happening,
  know that the kingdom of God is near.

# Luke 21:32
  Assuredly, I say to you,
  this generation will by no means pass away
  till all things take place.

# Luke 21:33
  Heaven and earth will pass away,
  but My words will by no means pass away.

# Luke 21:34
  But take heed to yourselves,
  lest your hearts be weighed down
  with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life,
  and that Day come on you unexpectedly.

# Luke 21:35
  For it will come as a snare on all those
  who dwell on the face of the whole earth.

# Luke 21:36
  Watch therefore,
  and pray always that you may be counted worthy
  to escape all these things
  that will come to pass,
  and to stand before the Son of Man.
}

# Luke 21:37
And in the daytime
He was teaching in the temple,
but at night
He went out and stayed on the mountain called Olivet.

# Luke 21:38
Then early in the morning all the people came to Him
in the temple to hear Him.

# Luke 22:1
Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near,
which is called Passover.

# Luke 22:2
And the chief priests and the scribes
sought how they might kill Him,
for they feared the people.

# Luke 22:3
Then Satan entered Judas, surnamed Iscariot,
who was numbered among the 12.

# Luke 22:4
So he went his way
and conferred with the chief priests and captains,
how he might betray Him to them.

# Luke 22:5
And they were glad,
and agreed to give him money.

# Luke 22:6
So he promised and sought opportunity to betray Him to them
in the absence of the multitude.

# Luke 22:7
Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread,
when the Passover must be killed.

# Luke 22:8
And He sent Peter and John, saying,
{
  Go and prepare the Passover for us,
  that we may eat.
}

# Luke 22:9
So they said to Him,
{
  Where do You want us to prepare?
}

# Luke 22:10
And He said to them,
{
  Behold, when you have entered the city,
  a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water;
  follow him into the house which he enters.

# Luke 22:11
  Then you shall say to the master of the house,
  {
    The Teacher says to you,
    {
      Where is the guest room
      where I may eat the Passover with My disciples?
    }
  }

# Luke 22:12
  Then he will show you a large, furnished upper room;
  there make ready.
}

# Luke 22:13
So they went and found it just as He had said to them,
and they prepared the Passover.

# Luke 22:14
When the hour had come, He sat down,
and the 12 apostles with Him.

# Luke 22:15
Then He said to them,
{
  With fervent desire
  I have desired to eat this Passover with you
  before I suffer;
# Luke 22:16
  for I say to you,
  I will no longer eat of it
  until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
}

# Luke 22:17
Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said,
{
  Take this and divide it among yourselves;
# Luke 22:18
  for I say to you,
  I will not drink of the fruit of the vine
  until the kingdom of God comes.
}

# Luke 22:19
And He took bread,
gave thanks and broke it,
and gave it to them,
saying,
{
  This is My body which is given for you;
  do this in remembrance of Me.
}

# Luke 22:20
Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying,
{
  This cup is the new covenant in My blood,
  which is shed for you.

# Luke 22:21
  But behold, the hand of My betrayer is with Me on the table.

# Luke 22:22
  And truly the Son of Man goes as it has been determined,
  but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed!
}

# Luke 22:23
Then they began to question among themselves,
which of them it was who would do this thing.

# Luke 22:24
Now there was also a dispute among them,
as to which of them should be considered the greatest.

# Luke 22:25
And He said to them,
{
  The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them,
  and those who exercise authority over them
  are called "benefactors".

# Luke 22:26
  But not so among you;
  on the contrary,
  he who is greatest among you,
  let him be as the younger,
  and he who governs as he who serves.

# Luke 22:27
  For who is greater,
  he who sits at the table,
  or he who serves?

  Is it not he who sits at the table?

  Yet I am among you as the One who serves.

# Luke 22:28
  But you are those who have continued with Me in My trials.

# Luke 22:29
  And I bestow upon you a kingdom,
  just as My Father bestowed one upon Me,
# Luke 22:30
  that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom,
  and sit on thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel.
}

# Luke 22:31
And the Lord said,
{
  Simon, Simon!

  Indeed, Satan has asked for you,
  that he may sift you as wheat.

# Luke 22:32
  But I have prayed for you,
  that your faith should not fail;
  and when you have returned to Me,
  strengthen your brethren.
}

# Luke 22:33
But he said to Him,
{
  Lord, I am ready to go with You,
  both to prison and to death.
}

# Luke 22:34
Then He said,
{
  I tell you, Peter,
  the rooster shall not crow this day
  before you will deny three times that you know Me.
}

# Luke 22:35
And He said to them,
{
  When I sent you without money bag, knapsack, and sandals,
  did you lack anything?
}

So they said,
{
  Nothing.
}

# Luke 22:36
Then He said to them,
{
  But now, he who has a money bag,
  let him take it,
  and likewise a knapsack;
  and he who has no sword,
  let him sell his garment and buy one.

# Luke 22:37
  For I say to you
  that this which is written must still be accomplished in Me:
  {
    And He was numbered with the transgressors.
  }

  For the things concerning Me have an end.
}

# Luke 22:38
So they said,
{
  Lord, look, here are two swords.
}

And He said to them,
{
  It is enough.
}

# Luke 22:39
Coming out,
He went to the Mount of Olives,
as He was accustomed,
and His disciples also followed Him.

# Luke 22:40
When He came to the place,
He said to them,
{
  Pray that you may not enter into temptation.
}

# Luke 22:41
And He was withdrawn from them
about a stone's throw,
and He knelt down and prayed,
# Luke 22:42
saying,
{
  Father, if it is Your will,
  take this cup away from Me;
  nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done.
}

# Luke 22:43
Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven,
strengthening Him.

# Luke 22:44
And being in agony,
He prayed more earnestly.

Then His sweat became like great drops of blood
falling down to the ground.

# Luke 22:45
When He rose up from prayer,
and had come to His disciples,
He found them sleeping from sorrow.

# Luke 22:46
Then He said to them,
{
  Why do you sleep?

  Rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.
}

# Luke 22:47
And while He was still speaking,
behold, a multitude;
and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve,
went before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.

# Luke 22:48
But Jesus said to him,
{
  Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?
}

# Luke 22:49
When those around Him saw what was going to happen,
they said to Him,
{
  Lord, shall we strike with the sword?
}

# Luke 22:50
And one of them struck the servant of the high priest
and cut off his right ear.

# Luke 22:51
But Jesus answered and said,
{
  Permit even this.
}

And He touched his ear and healed him.

# Luke 22:52
Then Jesus said to the chief priests,
captains of the temple,
and the elders who had come to Him,
{
  Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs?

# Luke 22:53
  When I was with you daily in the temple,
  you did not try to seize Me.

  But this is your hour,
  and the power of darkness.
}

# Luke 22:54
Having arrested Him,
they led Him and brought Him into the high priest's house.

But Peter followed at a distance.

# Luke 22:55
Now when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the courtyard
and sat down together,
Peter sat among them.

# Luke 22:56
And a certain servant girl,
seeing him as he sat by the fire,
looked intently at him and said,
{
  This man was also with Him.
}

# Luke 22:57
But he denied Him, saying,
{
  Woman, I do not know Him.
}

# Luke 22:58
And after a little while another saw him and said,
{
  You also are of them.
}

But Peter said,
{
  Man, I am not!
}

# Luke 22:59
Then after about an hour had passed,
another confidently affirmed, saying,
{
  Surely this fellow also was with Him,
  for he is a Galilean.
}

# Luke 22:60
But Peter said,
{
  Man, I do not know what you are saying!
}

Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.

# Luke 22:61
And the Lord turned and looked at Peter.

And Peter remembered the word of the Lord,
how He had said to him,
{
  Before the rooster crows,
  you will deny Me three times.
}

# Luke 22:62
So Peter went out and wept bitterly.

# Luke 22:63
Now the men who held Jesus mocked Him and beat Him.

# Luke 22:64
And having blindfolded Him,
they struck Him on the face and asked Him, saying,
{
  Prophesy!

  Who is the one who struck You?
}

# Luke 22:65
And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.

# Luke 22:66
As soon as it was day,
the elders of the people,
both chief priests and scribes,
came together and led Him into their council, saying,
{
# Luke 22:67
  If You are the Christ, tell us.
}

But He said to them,
{
  If I tell you,
  you will by no means believe.

# Luke 22:68
  And if I also ask you,
  you will by no means answer Me or let Me go.

# Luke 22:69
  Hereafter the Son of Man
  will sit on the right hand of the power of God.
}

# Luke 22:70
Then they all said,
{
  Are You then the Son of God?
}

So He said to them,
{
  You rightly say that I am.
}

# Luke 22:71
And they said,
{
  What further testimony do we need?

  For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth.
}

# Luke 23:1
Then the whole multitude of them arose and led Him to Pilate.

# Luke 23:2
And they began to accuse Him, saying,
{
  We found this fellow perverting the nation,
  and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar,
  saying that He Himself is Christ, a King.
}

# Luke 23:3
Then Pilate asked Him, saying,
{
  Are You the King of the Jews?
}

He answered him and said,
{
  It is as you say.
}

# Luke 23:4
So Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd,
{
  I find no fault in this Man.
}

# Luke 23:5
But they were the more fierce, saying,
{
  He stirs up the people,
  teaching throughout all Judea,
  beginning from Galilee to this place.
}

# Luke 23:6
When Pilate heard of Galilee,
he asked if the Man were a Galilean.

# Luke 23:7
And as soon as he knew that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction,
he sent Him to Herod,
who was also in Jerusalem at that time.

# Luke 23:8
Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad;
for he had desired for a long time to see Him,
because he had heard many things about Him,
and he hoped to see some miracle done by Him.

# Luke 23:9
Then he questioned Him with many words,
but He answered him nothing.

# Luke 23:10
And the chief priests and scribes stood
and vehemently accused Him.

# Luke 23:11
Then Herod, with his men of war,
treated Him with contempt and mocked Him,
arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe,
and sent Him back to Pilate.

# Luke 23:12
That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other,
for previously they had been at enmity with each other.

# Luke 23:13
Then Pilate,
when he had called together
the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,
# Luke 23:14
said to them,
{
  You have brought this Man to me,
  as one who misleads the people.

  And indeed, having examined Him in your presence,
  I have found no fault in this Man
  concerning those things of which you accuse Him;
# Luke 23:15
  no, neither did Herod, for I sent you back to him;
  and indeed nothing deserving of death has been done by Him.

# Luke 23:16
  I will therefore chastise Him and release Him
}
# Luke 23:17
(for it was necessary
for him to release one to them at the feast).

# Luke 23:18
And they all cried out at once, saying,
{
  Away with this Man, and release to us Barabbas
}--
# Luke 23:19
who had been thrown into prison
for a certain rebellion made in the city,
and for murder.

# Luke 23:20
Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus,
again called out to them.

# Luke 23:21
But they shouted, saying,
{
  Crucify Him, crucify Him!
}

# Luke 23:22
Then he said to them the third time,
{
  Why, what evil has He done?

  I have found no reason for death in Him.

  I will therefore chastise Him and let Him go.
}

# Luke 23:23
But they were insistent,
demanding with loud voices that He be crucified.

And the voices of these men and of the chief priests prevailed.

# Luke 23:24
So Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they requested.

# Luke 23:25
And he released to them the one they requested,
who for rebellion and murder had been thrown into prison;
but he delivered Jesus to their will.

# Luke 23:26
Now as they led Him away,
they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian,
who was coming from the country,
and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after Jesus.

# Luke 23:27
And a great multitude of the people followed Him,
and women who also mourned and lamented Him.

# Luke 23:28
But Jesus, turning to them, said,
{
  Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me,
  but weep for yourselves and for your children.

# Luke 23:29
  For indeed the days are coming in which they will say,
  {
    Blessed are the barren,
    wombs that never bore,
    and breasts which never nursed!
  }

# Luke 23:30
  Then they will begin
  {
    to say to the mountains,
    {
      Fall on us!
    }
    and to the hills,
    {
      Cover us!
    }
  }

# Luke 23:31
  For if they do these things in the green wood,
  what will be done in the dry?
}

# Luke 23:32
There were also two others, criminals,
led with Him to be put to death.

# Luke 23:33
And when they had come to the place called Calvary,
there they crucified Him,
and the criminals,
one on the right hand and the other on the left.

# Luke 23:34
Then Jesus said,
{
  Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.
}

And they divided His garments and cast lots.

# Luke 23:35
And the people stood looking on.

But even the rulers with them sneered, saying,
{
  He saved others;
  let Him save Himself
  if He is the Christ, the chosen of God.
}

# Luke 23:36
The soldiers also mocked Him,
coming and offering Him sour wine
# Luke 23:37
and saying,
{
  If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself.
}

# Luke 23:38
And an inscription also was written over Him
in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew:
{
  THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS
}

# Luke 23:39
Then one of the criminals who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying,
{
  If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us.
}

# Luke 23:40
But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying,
{
  Do you not even fear God,
  seeing you are under the same condemnation?

# Luke 23:41
  And we indeed justly,
  for we receive the due reward of our deeds;
  but this Man has done nothing wrong.
}

# Luke 23:42
Then he said to Jesus,
{
  Lord, remember me when You come into Your kingdom.
}

# Luke 23:43
And Jesus said to him,
{
  Assuredly, I say to you,
  today you will be with Me in Paradise.
}

# Luke 23:44
Now it was about the sixth hour,
and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.

# Luke 23:45
Then the sun was darkened,
and the veil of the temple was torn in two.

# Luke 23:46
And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said,
{
  Father,
  {
    into Your hands I commit My spirit.
  }
}

Having said this, He breathed His last.

# Luke 23:47
So when the centurion saw what had happened,
he glorified God, saying,
{
  Certainly this was a righteous Man!
}

# Luke 23:48
And the whole crowd who came together to that sight,
seeing what had been done,
beat their breasts and returned.

# Luke 23:49
But all His acquaintances,
and the women who followed Him from Galilee,
stood at a distance,
watching these things.

# Luke 23:50
Now behold,
there was a man named Joseph, a council member,
a good and just man.

# Luke 23:51
He had not consented to their decision and deed.

He was from Arimathea, a city of the Jews,
who himself was also waiting
for the kingdom of God.

# Luke 23:52
This man went to Pilate
and asked for the body of Jesus.

# Luke 23:53
Then he took it down,
wrapped it in linen,
and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock,
where no one had ever lain before.

# Luke 23:54
That day was the Preparation,
and the Sabbath drew near.

# Luke 23:55
And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after,
and they observed the tomb and how His body was laid.

# Luke 23:56
Then they returned and prepared spices and fragrant oils.

And they rested on the Sabbath according to the commandment.

# Luke 24:1
Now on the first day of the week,
very early in the morning,
they, and certain other women with them,
came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.

# Luke 24:2
But they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

# Luke 24:3
Then they went in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

# Luke 24:4
And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this,
that behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.

# Luke 24:5
Then, as they were afraid and bowed their faces to the earth,
they said to them,
{
  Why do you seek the living among the dead?

# Luke 24:6
  He is not here, but is risen!

  Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,
# Luke 24:7
  saying,
  {
    The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men,
    and be crucified,
    and the third day rise again.
  }
}

# Luke 24:8
And they remembered His words.

# Luke 24:9
Then they returned from the tomb
and told all these things to the 11 and to all the rest.

# Luke 24:10
It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James,
and the other women with them,
who told these things to the apostles.

# Luke 24:11
And their words seemed to them like idle tales,
and they did not believe them.

# Luke 24:12
But Peter arose and ran to the tomb;
and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths lying by themselves;
and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened.

# Luke 24:13
Now behold,
two of them were traveling that same day
to a village called Emmaus,
which was seven miles from Jerusalem.

# Luke 24:14
And they talked together of all these things which had happened.

# Luke 24:15
So it was, while they conversed and reasoned,
that Jesus Himself drew near and went with them.

# Luke 24:16
But their eyes were restrained,
so that they did not know Him.

# Luke 24:17
And He said to them,
{
  What kind of conversation is this
  that you have with one another as you walk and are sad?
}

# Luke 24:18
Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him,
{
  Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem,
  and have You not known the things which happened there
  in these days?
}

# Luke 24:19
And He said to them,
{
  What things?
}

So they said to Him,
{
  The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth,
  who was a Prophet mighty in deed and word
  before God and all the people,
# Luke 24:20
  and how the chief priests and our rulers
  delivered Him to be condemned to death,
  and crucified Him.

# Luke 24:21
  But we were hoping that it was He
  who was going to redeem Israel.

  Indeed, besides all this,
  today is the third day since these things happened.

# Luke 24:22
  Yes, and certain women of our company,
  who arrived at the tomb early, astonished us.

# Luke 24:23
  When they did not find His body,
  they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels
  who said He was alive.

# Luke 24:24
  And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb
  and found it just as the women had said;
  but Him they did not see.
}

# Luke 24:25
Then He said to them,
{
  O foolish ones,
  and slow of heart
  to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!

# Luke 24:26
  Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things
  and to enter into His glory?
}

# Luke 24:27
And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets,
He expounded to them in all the Scriptures
the things concerning Himself.

# Luke 24:28
Then they drew near to the village where they were going,
and He indicated that He would have gone farther.

# Luke 24:29
But they constrained Him, saying,
{
  Abide with us, for it is toward evening,
  and the day is far spent.
}

And He went in to stay with them.

# Luke 24:30
Now it came to pass,
as He sat at the table with them,
that He took bread,
blessed and broke it,
and gave it to them.

# Luke 24:31
Then their eyes were opened and they knew Him;
and He vanished from their sight.

# Luke 24:32
And they said to one another,
{
  Did not our heart burn within us
  while He talked with us on the road,
  and while He opened the Scriptures to us?
}

# Luke 24:33
So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem,
and found the 11 and those who were with them gathered together,
# Luke 24:34
saying,
{
  The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!
}

# Luke 24:35
And they told about the things that had happened on the road,
and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.

# Luke 24:36
Now as they said these things,
Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them,
and said to them,
{
  Peace to you.
}

# Luke 24:37
But they were terrified and frightened,
and supposed they had seen a spirit.

# Luke 24:38
And He said to them,
{
  Why are you troubled?

  And why do doubts arise in your hearts?

# Luke 24:39
  Behold My hands and My feet,
  that it is I Myself.

  Handle Me and see,
  for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.
}

# Luke 24:40
When He had said this,
He showed them His hands and His feet.

# Luke 24:41
But while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled,
He said to them,
{
  Have you any food here?
}

# Luke 24:42
So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.

# Luke 24:43
And He took it and ate in their presence.

# Luke 24:44
Then He said to them,
{
  These are the words which I spoke to you
  while I was still with you,
  that all things must be fulfilled
  which were written in the Law of Moses
  and the Prophets
  and the Psalms
  concerning Me.
}

# Luke 24:45
And He opened their understanding,
that they might comprehend the Scriptures.

# Luke 24:46
Then He said to them,
{
  Thus it is written,
  and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer
  and to rise from the dead the third day,
# Luke 24:47
  and that repentance and remission of sins
  should be preached in His name to all nations,
  beginning at Jerusalem.

# Luke 24:48
  And you are witnesses of these things.

# Luke 24:49
  Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you;
  but tarry in the city of Jerusalem
  until you are endued with power from on high.
}

# Luke 24:50
And He led them out as far as Bethany,
and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.

# Luke 24:51
Now it came to pass, while He blessed them,
that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven.

# Luke 24:52
And they worshiped Him,
and returned to Jerusalem
with great joy,
# Luke 24:53
and were continually
in the temple
praising and blessing God.

Amen.
