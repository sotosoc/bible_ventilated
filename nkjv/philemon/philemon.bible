# Philemon 1:1
Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus,
and Timothy our brother,

To Philemon
our beloved friend and fellow laborer,
# Philemon 1:2
to the beloved Apphia,
Archippus our fellow soldier,
and to the church in your house.

# Philemon 1:3
Grace to you and peace
from God our Father
and the Lord Jesus Christ.

# Philemon 1:4
I thank my God,
making mention of you always in my prayers,
# Philemon 1:5
hearing of your love and faith
which you have toward the Lord Jesus
and toward all the saints,
# Philemon 1:6
that the sharing of your faith may become effective
by the acknowledgment of every good thing
which is in you in Christ Jesus.

# Philemon 1:7
For we have great joy and consolation in your love,
because the hearts of the saints
have been refreshed by you, brother.

# Philemon 1:8
Therefore,
though I might be very bold in Christ
to command you what is fitting,
# Philemon 1:9
yet for love's sake I rather appeal to you --
being such a one as Paul, the aged,
and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ --
# Philemon 1:10
I appeal to you for my son Onesimus,
whom I have begotten while in my chains,
# Philemon 1:11
who once was unprofitable to you,
but now is profitable to you and to me.

# Philemon 1:12
I am sending him back.

You therefore receive him,
that is, my own heart,
# Philemon 1:13
whom I wished to keep with me,
that on your behalf
he might minister to me
in my chains
for the gospel.

# Philemon 1:14
But without your consent I wanted to do nothing,
that your good deed might not be by compulsion,
as it were, but voluntary.

# Philemon 1:15
For perhaps he departed for a while for this purpose,
that you might receive him forever,
# Philemon 1:16
no longer as a slave but more than a slave --
a beloved brother,
especially to me but how much more to you,
both in the flesh and in the Lord.

# Philemon 1:17
If then you count me as a partner,
receive him as you would me.

# Philemon 1:18
But if he has wronged you or owes anything,
put that on my account.

# Philemon 1:19
I, Paul, am writing with my own hand.

I will repay --
not to mention to you
that you owe me even your own self besides.

# Philemon 1:20
Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord;
refresh my heart in the Lord.

# Philemon 1:21
Having confidence in your obedience,
I write to you,
knowing that you will do even more than I say.

# Philemon 1:22
But, meanwhile,
also prepare a guest room for me,
for I trust that through your prayers
I shall be granted to you.

# Philemon 1:23
Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,
# Philemon 1:24
as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow laborers.

# Philemon 1:25
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

Amen.
