    When any one of you
    brings an offering to the Lord,
    you shall bring
    your offering of the livestock --
    of the herd and of the flock.

# Leviticus 1:3
    If his offering
    is a burnt sacrifice of the herd,
    let him offer
    a male without blemish;
    he shall offer it
    of his own free will
    at the door
    of the tabernacle of meeting
    before the Lord.

# Leviticus 1:4
    Then he shall put his hand
    on the head of the burnt offering,
    and it will be accepted
    on his behalf
    to make atonement for him.

# Leviticus 1:5
    He shall kill the bull
    before the Lord;
    and the priests, Aaron's sons,

    and sprinkle the blood
    all around on the altar
    that is by the door
    of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Leviticus 1:6
    And he shall

# Leviticus 1:7
    The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar,

# Leviticus 1:13
    but he shall wash the entrails and the legs with water.

    Then the priest shall bring it all and burn it on the altar;
    it is a burnt sacrifice,
    an offering made by fire,
    a sweet aroma to the Lord.

# Leviticus 1:14
    And if the burnt sacrifice of his offering

    Then he shall split it at its wings,
    but shall not divide it completely;

    He shall bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests,
    one of whom shall take
    from it his handful of fine flour and oil

    an offering made by fire,
    a sweet aroma to the Lord.

    No grain offering which you bring to the Lord

    As for the offering of the firstfruits,
    you shall offer them to the Lord,

# Leviticus 4:1
Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Leviticus 4:2
  Speak to the children of Israel, saying:

    If a person sins unintentionally
    against any of the commandments of the Lord
    in anything which ought not to be done,
    and does any of them,
# Leviticus 4:3
    if the anointed priest sins,
    bringing guilt on the people,
    then let him offer to the Lord for his sin which he has sinned
    a young bull without blemish as a sin offering.

    He shall bring the bull to the door of the tabernacle of meeting
    before the Lord,
    lay his hand on the bull's head,
    and kill the bull before the Lord.

    Then the anointed priest shall take some of the bull's blood
    and bring it to the tabernacle of meeting.

    The priest shall dip his finger in the blood
    and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before the Lord,
    in front of the veil of the sanctuary.

    And the priest shall put some of the blood
    on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord,
    which is in the tabernacle of meeting;
    and he shall pour the remaining blood of the bull
    at the base of the altar of the burnt offering,
    which is at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

    He shall take from it all the fat of the bull
    as the sin offering.

    The fat that covers the entrails
    and all the fat which is on the entrails,
# Leviticus 4:4
    the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks,
    and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys,
    he shall remove,
    # Leviticus 4:5
    as it was taken from the bull of the sacrifice of the peace offering;
    and the priest shall burn them on the altar of the burnt offering.

    But the bull's hide and all its flesh,
    with its head and legs,
    its entrails and offal --
    # Leviticus 4:6
    the whole bull he shall carry
    outside the camp to a clean place,
    where the ashes are poured out,
    and burn it on wood with fire;
    where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.

    Now if the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally,
    and the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly,
    and they have done something
    against any of the commandments of the Lord
    in anything which should not be done,
    and are guilty;
# Leviticus 4:7
    when the sin which they have committed becomes known,
    then the assembly shall offer a young bull for the sin,
    and bring it before the tabernacle of meeting.

    And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands
    on the head of the bull before the Lord.

    Then the bull shall be killed before the Lord.

    The anointed priest shall bring some of the bull's blood
    to the tabernacle of meeting.

    Then the priest shall dip his finger in the blood
    and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord,
    in front of the veil.

    which is before the Lord,
    which is in the tabernacle of meeting;

    at the base of the altar of burnt offering,
    which is at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

    He shall take all the fat from it and burn it on the altar.

    And he shall do with the bull
    as he did with the bull as a sin offering;
    thus he shall do with it.

    So the priest shall make atonement for them,
    and it shall be forgiven them.

    Then he shall carry the bull outside the camp,
    and burn it as he burned the first bull.

    It is a sin offering for the assembly.

    When a ruler has sinned,
    and done something unintentionally
    against any of the commandments of the Lord his God
    in anything which should not be done,
    and is guilty,

    a male without blemish.

    And he shall lay his hand on the head of the goat,
    and kill it at the place where they kill the burnt offering
    before the Lord.

    It is a sin offering.

    The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering
    with his finger,
    put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
    and pour its blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering.

    And he shall burn all its fat on the altar,
    like the fat of the sacrifice of the peace offering.

    So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin,
    and it shall be forgiven him.

    If anyone of the common people sins unintentionally
    by doing something against any of the commandments of the Lord
    in anything which ought not to be done,

    a female without blemish,
    for his sin which he has committed.

    And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering,
    and kill the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering.

    Then the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger,
    put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
    and pour all the remaining blood at the base of the altar.

    He shall remove all its fat,
    as fat is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offering;
    and the priest shall burn it on the altar
    for a sweet aroma to the Lord.

    So the priest shall make atonement for him,
    and it shall be forgiven him.

    If he brings a lamb as his sin offering,
    he shall bring a female without blemish.

    Then he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering,
    and kill it as a sin offering
    at the place where they kill the burnt offering.

    The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering
    with his finger,

    whether it is the carcass of an unclean beast,
    or the carcass of unclean livestock,
    or the carcass of unclean creeping things,

    he also shall be unclean and guilty.

# Leviticus 5:4
    Or if a person swears,
    speaking thoughtlessly with his lips to do evil or to do good,

    and he shall bring his trespass offering to the Lord
    for his sin which he has committed,
    a female from the flock,
    a lamb or a kid of the goats as a sin offering.

    So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin.

    who shall offer that which is for the sin offering first,
    and wring off its head from its neck,

    Then he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering
    on the side of the altar,

    at the base of the altar.

    It is a sin offering.

    for his sin which he has committed,

    But if he is not able to bring two turtledoves
    or two young pigeons,

# Leviticus 6:27
    Everyone who touches its flesh must be holy.

    And when its blood is sprinkled on any garment,
    you shall wash that on which it was sprinkled,
    in a holy place.

# Leviticus 6:28
    But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken.

    And if it is boiled in a bronze pot,
    it shall be both scoured and rinsed in water.

# Leviticus 6:29
    All the males among the priests may eat it.

    It is most holy.

# Leviticus 6:30
    But no sin offering
    from which any of the blood is brought
    into the tabernacle of meeting,
    to make atonement in the holy place,
    shall be eaten.

    It shall be burned in the fire.

# Leviticus 7:1
    Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering
    (it is most holy):

# Leviticus 7:2
    In the place where they kill the burnt offering
    they shall kill the trespass offering.

    And its blood he shall sprinkle all around on the altar.

# Leviticus 7:3
    And he shall offer from it all its fat.

    The fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails,
# Leviticus 7:4
    the two kidneys and the fat that is on them by the flanks,
    and the fatty lobe attached to the liver above the kidneys,
    he shall remove;
# Leviticus 7:5
    and the priest shall burn them on the altar
    as an offering
    made by fire
    to the Lord.

    It is a trespass offering.

# Leviticus 7:6
    Every male among the priests may eat it.

    It shall be eaten in a holy place.

    It is most holy.

# Leviticus 7:7
    The trespass offering is like the sin offering;
    there is one law for them both:
    the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it.

# Leviticus 7:8
    And the priest who offers anyone's burnt offering,
    that priest shall have for himself
    the skin of the burnt offering
    which he has offered.

# Leviticus 7:9
    Also every grain offering that is baked in the oven
    and all that is prepared in the covered pan,
    or in a pan,
    shall be the priest's who offers it.

# Leviticus 7:10
    Every grain offering,
    whether mixed with oil, or dry,
    shall belong to all the sons of Aaron,
    to one as much as the other.

# Leviticus 7:11
    This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings
    which he shall offer to the Lord:

# Leviticus 7:12
    If he offers it for a thanksgiving,
    then he shall offer,
    with the sacrifice of thanksgiving,
    unleavened cakes mixed with oil,
    unleavened wafers anointed with oil,
    or cakes of blended flour mixed with oil.

# Leviticus 7:13
    Besides the cakes,
    as his offering he shall offer leavened bread
    with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offering.

# Leviticus 7:14
    And from it he shall offer one cake from each offering
    as a heave offering to the Lord.

    It shall belong to the priest
    who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering.

# Leviticus 7:15
    The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering
    for thanksgiving
    shall be eaten the same day it is offered.

    He shall not leave any of it until morning.

# Leviticus 7:16
    But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow
    or a voluntary offering,
    it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice;
    but on the next day the remainder of it also may be eaten;
# Leviticus 7:17
    the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
    must be burned with fire.

# Leviticus 7:18
    And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offering
    is eaten at all on the third day,
    it shall not be accepted,
    nor shall it be imputed to him;
    it shall be an abomination to him who offers it,
    and the person who eats of it shall bear guilt.

# Leviticus 7:19
    The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten.

    It shall be burned with fire.

    And as for the clean flesh,
    all who are clean may eat of it.

# Leviticus 7:20
    But the person who eats the flesh of the sacrifice
    of the peace offering
    that belongs to the Lord,
    while he is unclean,
    that person shall be cut off from his people.

# Leviticus 7:21
    Moreover the person who touches any unclean thing,
    such as human uncleanness,
    an unclean animal,
    or any abominable unclean thing,
    and who eats the flesh of the sacrifice of the peace offering
    that belongs to the Lord,
    that person shall be cut off from his people.
  }
}

# Leviticus 7:22
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Leviticus 7:23
  Speak to the children of Israel, saying:
  {
    You shall not eat any fat,
    of ox or sheep or goat.

# Leviticus 7:24
    And the fat of an animal that dies naturally,
    and the fat of what is torn by wild beasts,
    may be used in any other way;
    but you shall by no means eat it.

# Leviticus 7:25
    For whoever eats the fat of the animal
    of which men offer an offering
    made by fire
    to the Lord,
    the person who eats it
    shall be cut off from his people.

# Leviticus 7:26
    Moreover you shall not eat any blood in any of your dwellings,
    whether of bird or beast.

# Leviticus 7:27
    Whoever eats any blood,
    that person shall be cut off from his people.
  }
}

# Leviticus 7:28
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Leviticus 7:29
  Speak to the children of Israel, saying:
  {
    He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offering to the Lord
    shall bring his offering to the Lord
    from the sacrifice of his peace offering.

# Leviticus 7:30
    His own hands shall bring the offerings
    made by fire
    to the Lord.

    The fat with the breast he shall bring,
    that the breast may be waved as a wave offering before the Lord.

# Leviticus 7:31
    And the priest shall burn the fat on the altar,
    but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

# Leviticus 7:32
    Also the right thigh you shall give to the priest
    as a heave offering
    from the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

# Leviticus 7:33
    He among the sons of Aaron,
    who offers the blood of the peace offering and the fat,
    shall have the right thigh for his part.

# Leviticus 7:34
    For the breast of the wave offering
    and the thigh of the heave offering
    I have taken from the children of Israel,
    from the sacrifices of their peace offerings,
    and I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons
    from the children of Israel by a statute forever.
  }
}

# Leviticus 7:35
This is the consecrated portion for Aaron and his sons,
from the offerings
made by fire
to the Lord,
on the day when Moses presented them
to minister to the Lord as priests.

# Leviticus 7:36
The Lord commanded this to be given to them
by the children of Israel,
on the day that He anointed them,
by a statute forever throughout their generations.

# Leviticus 7:37
This is the law of the burnt offering,
the grain offering,
the sin offering,
the trespass offering,
the consecrations,
and the sacrifice of the peace offering,
# Leviticus 7:38
which the Lord commanded Moses on Mount Sinai,
on the day when He commanded the children of Israel
to offer their offerings to the Lord in the Wilderness of Sinai.

# Leviticus 8:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Leviticus 8:2
  Take Aaron and his sons with him,
  and the garments,
  the anointing oil,
  a bull as the sin offering,
  two rams,
  and a basket of unleavened bread;
# Leviticus 8:3
  and gather all the congregation together
  at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.
}

# Leviticus 8:4
So Moses did as the Lord commanded him.

And the congregation was gathered together
at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Leviticus 8:5
And Moses said to the congregation,
{
  This is what the Lord commanded to be done.
}

# Leviticus 8:6
Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons
and washed them with water.

# Leviticus 8:7
And he put the tunic on him,
girded him with the sash,
clothed him with the robe,
and put the ephod on him;
and he girded him
with the intricately woven band of the ephod,
and with it tied the ephod on him.

# Leviticus 8:8
Then he put the breastplate on him,
and he put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate.

# Leviticus 8:9
And he put the turban on his head.

Also on the turban,
on its front, he put the golden plate, the holy crown,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.

# Leviticus 8:10
Also Moses took the anointing oil,
and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it,
and consecrated them.

# Leviticus 8:11
He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times,
anointed the altar and all its utensils,
and the laver and its base,
to consecrate them.

# Leviticus 8:12
And he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head
and anointed him,
to consecrate him.

# Leviticus 8:13
Then Moses brought Aaron's sons and put tunics on them,
girded them with sashes,
and put hats on them,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.

# Leviticus 8:14
And he brought the bull for the sin offering.

Then Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull
for the sin offering,
# Leviticus 8:15
and Moses killed it.

Then he took the blood,
and put some on the horns of the altar all around with his finger,
and purified the altar.

And he poured the blood at the base of the altar,
and consecrated it,
to make atonement for it.

# Leviticus 8:16
Then he took all the fat that was on the entrails,
the fatty lobe attached to the liver,
and the two kidneys with their fat,
and Moses burned them on the altar.

# Leviticus 8:17
But the bull,
its hide,
its flesh,
and its offal,
he burned with fire outside the camp,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.

# Leviticus 8:18
Then he brought the ram as the burnt offering.

And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,
# Leviticus 8:19
and Moses killed it.

Then he sprinkled the blood all around on the altar.

# Leviticus 8:20
And he cut the ram into pieces;
and Moses burned the head, the pieces, and the fat.

# Leviticus 8:21
Then he washed the entrails and the legs in water.

And Moses burned the whole ram on the altar.

It was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet aroma,
an offering
made by fire
to the Lord,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.

# Leviticus 8:22
And he brought the second ram,
the ram of consecration.

Then Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram,
# Leviticus 8:23
and Moses killed it.

Also he took some of its blood
and put it on the tip of Aaron's right ear,
on the thumb of his right hand,
and on the big toe of his right foot.

# Leviticus 8:24
Then he brought Aaron's sons.

And Moses put some of the blood on the tips of their right ears,
on the thumbs of their right hands,
and on the big toes of their right feet.

And Moses sprinkled the blood all around on the altar.

# Leviticus 8:25
Then he took the fat and the fat tail,
all the fat that was on the entrails,
the fatty lobe attached to the liver,
the two kidneys and their fat,
and the right thigh;
# Leviticus 8:26
and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the Lord
he took one unleavened cake,
a cake of bread anointed with oil,
and one wafer,
and put them on the fat and on the right thigh;
# Leviticus 8:27
and he put all these in Aaron's hands and in his sons' hands,
and waved them as a wave offering before the Lord.

# Leviticus 8:28
Then Moses took them from their hands and burned them on the altar,
on the burnt offering.

They were consecration offerings for a sweet aroma.

That was an offering
made by fire
to the Lord.

# Leviticus 8:29
And Moses took the breast
and waved it as a wave offering before the Lord.

It was Moses' part of the ram of consecration,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.

# Leviticus 8:30
Then Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood
which was on the altar,
and sprinkled it on Aaron,
on his garments,
on his sons,
and on the garments of his sons with him;
and he consecrated Aaron,
his garments,
his sons,
and the garments of his sons with him.

# Leviticus 8:31
And Moses said to Aaron and his sons,
{
  Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
  and eat it there with the bread
  that is in the basket of consecration offerings,
  as I commanded, saying,
  {
    Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
  }

# Leviticus 8:32
  What remains of the flesh and of the bread
  you shall burn with fire.

# Leviticus 8:33
  And you shall not go outside the door of the tabernacle of meeting
  for seven days,
  until the days of your consecration are ended.

  For seven days he shall consecrate you.

# Leviticus 8:34
  As he has done this day,
  so the Lord has commanded to do,
  to make atonement for you.

# Leviticus 8:35
  Therefore you shall stay at the door of the tabernacle of meeting
  day and night for seven days,
  and keep the charge of the Lord,
  so that you may not die;
  for so I have been commanded.
}

# Leviticus 8:36
So Aaron and his sons did all the things that the Lord had commanded
by the hand of Moses.

# Leviticus 9:1
It came to pass on the eighth day
that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.

# Leviticus 9:2
And he said to Aaron,
{
  Take for yourself a young bull as a sin offering
  and a ram as a burnt offering,
  without blemish,
  and offer them before the Lord.

  And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying,
  {
    Take a kid of the goats as a sin offering,
    and a calf and a lamb,
    both of the first year,
    without blemish,
    as a burnt offering,
# Leviticus 9:3
    also a bull and a ram as peace offerings,
    to sacrifice before the Lord,
    and a grain offering mixed with oil;
    for today the Lord will appear to you.
  }
}

# Leviticus 9:4
So they brought what Moses commanded
before the tabernacle of meeting.

And all the congregation drew near and stood before the Lord.

# Leviticus 9:5
Then Moses said,
{
  This is the thing which the Lord commanded you to do,
  and the glory of the Lord will appear to you.
}

# Leviticus 9:6
And Moses said to Aaron,
{
  Go to the altar,
  offer your sin offering and your burnt offering,
  and make atonement for yourself and for the people.

  Offer the offering of the people,
  and make atonement for them,
  as the Lord commanded.
}

# Leviticus 9:7
Aaron therefore went to the altar
and killed the calf of the sin offering,
which was for himself.

# Leviticus 9:8
Then the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him.

And he dipped his finger in the blood,
put it on the horns of the altar,
and poured the blood at the base of the altar.

# Leviticus 9:9
But the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe
from the liver of the sin offering
he burned on the altar,
as the Lord had commanded Moses.

# Leviticus 9:10
The flesh and the hide he burned with fire outside the camp.

# Leviticus 9:11
And he killed the burnt offering;
and Aaron's sons presented to him the blood,
which he sprinkled all around on the altar.

# Leviticus 9:12
Then they presented the burnt offering to him,
with its pieces and head,
and he burned them on the altar.

# Leviticus 9:13
And he washed the entrails and the legs,
and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.

# Leviticus 9:14
Then he brought the people's offering,
and took the goat,
which was the sin offering for the people,
and killed it and offered it for sin,
like the first one.

# Leviticus 9:15
And he brought the burnt offering
and offered it according to the prescribed manner.

# Leviticus 9:16
Then he brought the grain offering,
took a handful of it,
and burned it on the altar,
besides the burnt sacrifice of the morning.

# Leviticus 9:17
He also killed the bull and the ram
as sacrifices of peace offerings,
which were for the people.

And Aaron's sons presented to him the blood,
which he sprinkled all around on the altar,
# Leviticus 9:18
and the fat from the bull and the ram --
the fatty tail,
what covers the entrails and the kidneys,
and the fatty lobe attached to the liver;
# Leviticus 9:19
and they put the fat on the breasts.

Then he burned the fat on the altar;
# Leviticus 9:20
but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved as a wave offering
before the Lord,
as Moses had commanded.

# Leviticus 9:21
Then Aaron lifted his hand toward the people,
blessed them,
and came down from offering the sin offering,
the burnt offering,
and peace offerings.

# Leviticus 9:22
And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of meeting,
and came out and blessed the people.

Then the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people,
# Leviticus 9:23
and fire came out from before the Lord
and consumed the burnt offering
and the fat on the altar.

When all the people saw it,
they shouted and fell on their faces.

# Leviticus 10:1
Then Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron,
each took his censer and put fire in it,
put incense on it,
and offered profane fire before the Lord,
which He had not commanded them.

# Leviticus 10:2
So fire went out from the Lord and devoured them,
and they died before the Lord.

# Leviticus 10:3
And Moses said to Aaron,
{
  This is what the Lord spoke, saying:
  {
    By those who come near Me I must be regarded as holy;
    And before all the people I must be glorified.
  }
}

So Aaron held his peace.

# Leviticus 10:4
And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan,
the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron,
and said to them,
{
  Come near,
  carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
}

# Leviticus 10:5
So they went near and carried them by their tunics out of the camp,
as Moses had said.

# Leviticus 10:6
And Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons,
{
  Do not uncover your heads nor tear your clothes,
  lest you die,
  and wrath come upon all the people.

  But let your brethren,
  the whole house of Israel,
  bewail the burning which the Lord has kindled.

# Leviticus 10:7
  You shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
  lest you die,
  for the anointing oil of the Lord is upon you.
}

And they did according to the word of Moses.

# Leviticus 10:8
Then the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying:
{
# Leviticus 10:9
  Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink,
  you, nor your sons with you,
  when you go into the tabernacle of meeting,
  lest you die.

  It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations,
# Leviticus 10:10
  that you may distinguish between holy and unholy,
  and between unclean and clean,
# Leviticus 10:11
  and that you may teach the children of Israel
  all the statutes which the Lord has spoken to them
  by the hand of Moses.
}

# Leviticus 10:12
And Moses spoke to Aaron,
and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his sons who were left:
{
  Take the grain offering that remains
  of the offerings
  made by fire
  to the Lord,
  and eat it without leaven beside the altar;
  for it is most holy.

# Leviticus 10:13
  You shall eat it in a holy place,
  because it is your due and your sons' due,
  of the sacrifices
  made by fire
  to the Lord;
  for so I have been commanded.

# Leviticus 10:14
  The breast of the wave offering
  and the thigh of the heave offering
  you shall eat in a clean place,
  you,
  your sons,
  and your daughters with you;
  for they are your due and your sons' due,
  which are given from the sacrifices of peace offerings
  of the children of Israel.

# Leviticus 10:15
  The thigh of the heave offering
  and the breast of the wave offering
  they shall bring with the offerings of fat
  made by fire,
  to offer as a wave offering before the Lord.

  And it shall be yours and your sons' with you,
  by a statute forever,
  as the Lord has commanded.
}

# Leviticus 10:16
Then Moses made careful inquiry about the goat of the sin offering,
and there it was -- burned up.

And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar,
the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,
{
  Why have you not eaten the sin offering in a holy place,
  since it is most holy,
  and God has given it to you to bear the guilt of the congregation,
  to make atonement for them before the Lord?

# Leviticus 10:17
  See!

  Its blood was not brought inside the holy place;
  indeed you should have eaten it in a holy place,
  as I commanded.
}

# Leviticus 10:18
And Aaron said to Moses,
{
  Look,
  this day they have offered their sin offering
  and their burnt offering
  before the Lord,
  and such things have befallen me!

  If I had eaten the sin offering today,
  would it have been accepted in the sight of the Lord?
}

# Leviticus 10:19
So when Moses heard that, he was content.

# Leviticus 11:1
Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying to them,
{
# Leviticus 11:2
  Speak to the children of Israel, saying,
  {
    These are the animals which you may eat
    among all the animals that are on the earth:

# Leviticus 11:3
    Among the animals, whatever divides the hoof,
    having cloven hooves and chewing the cud --
    that you may eat.

# Leviticus 11:4
    Nevertheless these you shall not eat
    among those that chew the cud
    or those that have cloven hooves:
    the camel,
    because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves,
    is unclean to you;
# Leviticus 11:5
    the rock hyrax,
    because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves,
    is unclean to you;
# Leviticus 11:6
    the hare,
    because it chews the cud but does not have cloven hooves,
    is unclean to you;
# Leviticus 11:7
    and the swine,
    though it divides the hoof, having cloven hooves,
    yet does not chew the cud,
    is unclean to you.

# Leviticus 11:8
    Their flesh you shall not eat,
    and their carcasses you shall not touch.

    They are unclean to you.

# Leviticus 11:9
    These you may eat of all that are in the water:
    whatever in the water has fins and scales,
    whether in the seas or in the rivers --
    that you may eat.

# Leviticus 11:10
    But all in the seas or in the rivers
    that do not have fins and scales,
    all that move in the water
    or any living thing which is in the water,
    they are an abomination to you.

# Leviticus 11:11
    They shall be an abomination to you;
    you shall not eat their flesh,
    but you shall regard their carcasses as an abomination.

# Leviticus 11:12
    Whatever in the water does not have fins or scales --
    that shall be an abomination to you.

# Leviticus 11:13
    And these you shall regard as an abomination among the birds;
    they shall not be eaten,
    they are an abomination:
    the eagle,
    the vulture,
    the buzzard,
# Leviticus 11:14
    the kite,
    and the falcon after its kind;
# Leviticus 11:15
    every raven after its kind,
# Leviticus 11:16
    the ostrich,
    the short-eared owl,
    the sea gull,
    and the hawk after its kind;
# Leviticus 11:17
    the little owl,
    the fisher owl,
    and the screech owl;
# Leviticus 11:18
    the white owl,
    the jackdaw,
    and the carrion vulture;
# Leviticus 11:19
    the stork,
    the heron after its kind,
    the hoopoe,
    and the bat.

# Leviticus 11:20
    All flying insects that creep on all fours
    shall be an abomination to you.

# Leviticus 11:21
    Yet these you may eat of every flying insect
    that creeps on all fours:
    those which have jointed legs above their feet
    with which to leap on the earth.

# Leviticus 11:22
    These you may eat:
    the locust after its kind,
    the destroying locust after its kind,
    the cricket after its kind,
    and the grasshopper after its kind.

# Leviticus 11:23
    But all other flying insects which have four feet
    shall be an abomination to you.

# Leviticus 11:24
    By these you shall become unclean;
    whoever touches the carcass of any of them
    shall be unclean until evening;
# Leviticus 11:25
    whoever carries part of the carcass of any of them
    shall wash his clothes and be unclean until evening:

# Leviticus 11:26
    The carcass of any animal which divides the foot,
    but is not cloven-hoofed or does not chew the cud,
    is unclean to you.

    Everyone who touches it shall be unclean.

# Leviticus 11:27
    And whatever goes on its paws,
    among all kinds of animals that go on all fours,
    those are unclean to you.

    Whoever touches any such carcass
    shall be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 11:28
    Whoever carries any such carcass shall wash his clothes
    and be unclean until evening.

    It is unclean to you.

# Leviticus 11:29
    These also shall be unclean to you
    among the creeping things that creep on the earth:
    the mole,
    the mouse,
    and the large lizard after its kind;
# Leviticus 11:30
    the gecko,
    the monitor lizard,
    the sand reptile,
    the sand lizard,
    and the chameleon.

# Leviticus 11:31
    These are unclean to you among all that creep.

    Whoever touches them when
    they are dead shall be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 11:32
    Anything on which any of them falls,
    when they are dead shall be unclean,
    whether it is any item of wood or clothing or skin or sack,
    whatever item it is,
    in which any work is done,
    it must be put in water.

    And it shall be unclean until evening;
    then it shall be clean.

# Leviticus 11:33
    Any earthen vessel into which any of them falls
    you shall break;
    and whatever is in it shall be unclean:
# Leviticus 11:34
    in such a vessel,
    any edible food upon which water falls becomes unclean,
    and any drink that may be drunk from it becomes unclean.

# Leviticus 11:35
    And everything on which a part of any such carcass falls
    shall be unclean;
    whether it is an oven or cooking stove,
    it shall be broken down;
    for they are unclean,
    and shall be unclean to you.

# Leviticus 11:36
    Nevertheless a spring or a cistern,
    in which there is plenty of water,
    shall be clean,
    but whatever touches any such carcass becomes unclean.

# Leviticus 11:37
    And if a part of any such carcass falls on any planting seed
    which is to be sown,
    it remains clean.

# Leviticus 11:38
    But if water is put on the seed,
    and if a part of any such carcass falls on it,
    it becomes unclean to you.

# Leviticus 11:39
    And if any animal which you may eat dies,
    he who touches its carcass shall be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 11:40
    He who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes
    and be unclean until evening.

    He also who carries its carcass shall wash his clothes
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 11:41
    And every creeping thing that creeps on the earth
    shall be an abomination.

    It shall not be eaten.

# Leviticus 11:42
    Whatever crawls on its belly,
    whatever goes on all fours,
    or whatever has many feet
    among all creeping things that creep on the earth --
    these you shall not eat,
    for they are an abomination.

# Leviticus 11:43
    You shall not make yourselves abominable
    with any creeping thing that creeps;
    nor shall you make yourselves unclean with them,
    lest you be defiled by them.

# Leviticus 11:44
    For I am the Lord your God.

    You shall therefore consecrate yourselves,
    and you shall be holy;
    for I am holy.

    Neither shall you defile yourselves
    with any creeping thing that creeps on the earth.

# Leviticus 11:45
    For I am the Lord who brings you up out of the land of Egypt,
    to be your God.

    You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.

# Leviticus 11:46
    This is the law of the animals and the birds
    and every living creature that moves in the waters,
    and of every creature that creeps on the earth,
# Leviticus 11:47
    to distinguish between the unclean and the clean,
    and between the animal that may be eaten
    and the animal that may not be eaten.

# Leviticus 12:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Leviticus 12:2
  Speak to the children of Israel, saying:
  {
    If a woman has conceived,
    and borne a male child,
    then she shall be unclean seven days;
    as in the days of her customary impurity
    she shall be unclean.

# Leviticus 12:3
    And on the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin
    shall be circumcised.

# Leviticus 12:4
    She shall then continue in the blood of her purification
    33 days.

    She shall not touch any hallowed thing,
    nor come into the sanctuary
    until the days of her purification are fulfilled.

# Leviticus 12:5
    But if she bears a female child,
    then she shall be unclean two weeks,
    as in her customary impurity,
    and she shall continue in the blood of her purification
    66 days.

# Leviticus 12:6
    When the days of her purification are fulfilled,
    whether for a son or a daughter,
    she shall bring to the priest a lamb of the first year
    as a burnt offering,
    and a young pigeon or a turtledove
    as a sin offering,
    to the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Leviticus 12:7
    Then he shall offer it before the Lord,
    and make atonement for her.

    And she shall be clean from the flow of her blood.

    This is the law for her who has borne a male or a female.

# Leviticus 12:8
    And if she is not able to bring a lamb,
    then she may bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons --
    one as a burnt offering and the other as a sin offering.

    So the priest shall make atonement for her,
    and she will be clean.

# Leviticus 13:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
{
# Leviticus 13:2
  When a man has on the skin of his body
  a swelling,
  a scab,
  or a bright spot,
  and it becomes on the skin of his body like a leprous sore,
  then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest
  or to one of his sons the priests.

# Leviticus 13:3
  The priest shall examine the sore on the skin of the body;
  and if the hair on the sore has turned white,
  and the sore appears to be deeper than the skin of his body,
  it is a leprous sore.

  Then the priest shall examine him,
  and pronounce him unclean.

# Leviticus 13:4
  But if the bright spot is white on the skin of his body,
  and does not appear to be deeper than the skin,
  and its hair has not turned white,
  then the priest shall isolate the one who has the sore seven days.

# Leviticus 13:5
  And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day;
  and indeed if the sore appears to be as it was,
  and the sore has not spread on the skin,
  then the priest shall isolate him another seven days.

# Leviticus 13:6
  Then the priest shall examine him again on the seventh day;
  and indeed if the sore has faded,
  and the sore has not spread on the skin,
  then the priest shall pronounce him clean;
  it is only a scab,
  and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.

# Leviticus 13:7
  But if the scab should at all spread over the skin,
  after he has been seen by the priest for his cleansing,
  he shall be seen by the priest again.

# Leviticus 13:8
  And if the priest sees
  that the scab has indeed spread on the skin,
  then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

  It is leprosy.

# Leviticus 13:9
  When the leprous sore is on a person,
  then he shall be brought to the priest.

# Leviticus 13:10
  And the priest shall examine him;
  and indeed if the swelling on the skin is white,
  and it has turned the hair white,
  and there is a spot of raw flesh in the swelling,
# Leviticus 13:11
  it is an old leprosy on the skin of his body.

  The priest shall pronounce him unclean,
  and shall not isolate him, for he is unclean.

# Leviticus 13:12
  And if leprosy breaks out all over the skin,
  and the leprosy covers all the skin of the one who has the sore,
  from his head to his foot,
  wherever the priest looks,
# Leviticus 13:13
  then the priest shall consider;
  and indeed if the leprosy has covered all his body,
  he shall pronounce him clean who has the sore.

  It has all turned white.

  He is clean.

# Leviticus 13:14
  But when raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean.

# Leviticus 13:15
  And the priest shall examine the raw flesh
  and pronounce him to be unclean;
  for the raw flesh is unclean.

  It is leprosy.

# Leviticus 13:16
  Or if the raw flesh changes and turns white again,
  he shall come to the priest.

# Leviticus 13:17
  And the priest shall examine him;
  and indeed if the sore has turned white,
  then the priest shall pronounce him clean who has the sore.

  He is clean.

# Leviticus 13:18
  If the body develops a boil in the skin,
  and it is healed,
# Leviticus 13:19
  and in the place of the boil there comes a white swelling
  or a bright spot, reddish-white,
  then it shall be shown to the priest;
# Leviticus 13:20
  and if, when the priest sees it,
  it indeed appears deeper than the skin,
  and its hair has turned white,
  the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

  It is a leprous sore which has broken out of the boil.

# Leviticus 13:21
  But if the priest examines it,
  and indeed there are no white hairs in it,
  and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded,
  then the priest shall isolate him seven days;
# Leviticus 13:22
  and if it should at all spread over the skin,
  then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

  It is a leprous sore.

# Leviticus 13:23
  But if the bright spot stays in one place, and has not spread,
  it is the scar of the boil;
  and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

# Leviticus 13:24
  Or if the body receives a burn on its skin by fire,
  and the raw flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot,
  reddish-white or white,
# Leviticus 13:25
  then the priest shall examine it;
  and indeed if the hair of the bright spot has turned white,
  and it appears deeper than the skin,
  it is leprosy broken out in the burn.

  Therefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

  It is a leprous sore.

# Leviticus 13:26
  But if the priest examines it,
  and indeed there are no white hairs in the bright spot,
  and it is not deeper than the skin, but has faded,
  then the priest shall isolate him seven days.

# Leviticus 13:27
  And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day.

  If it has at all spread over the skin,
  then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

  It is a leprous sore.

# Leviticus 13:28
  But if the bright spot stays in one place,
  and has not spread on the skin, but has faded,
  it is a swelling from the burn.

  The priest shall pronounce him clean,
  for it is the scar from the burn.

# Leviticus 13:29
  If a man or woman has a sore on the head or the beard,
# Leviticus 13:30
  then the priest shall examine the sore;
  and indeed if it appears deeper than the skin,
  and there is in it thin yellow hair,
  then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

  It is a scaly leprosy of the head or beard.

# Leviticus 13:31
  But if the priest examines the scaly sore,
  and indeed it does not appear deeper than the skin,
  and there is no black hair in it,
  then the priest shall isolate the one who has the scale
  seven days.

# Leviticus 13:32
  And on the seventh day the priest shall examine the sore;
  and indeed if the scale has not spread,
  and there is no yellow hair in it,
  and the scale does not appear deeper than the skin,
# Leviticus 13:33
  he shall shave himself,
  but the scale he shall not shave.

  And the priest shall isolate the one who has the scale
  another seven days.

# Leviticus 13:34
  On the seventh day the priest shall examine the scale;
  and indeed if the scale has not spread over the skin,
  and does not appear deeper than the skin,
  then the priest shall pronounce him clean.

  He shall wash his clothes and be clean.

# Leviticus 13:35
  But if the scale should at all spread over the skin
  after his cleansing,
# Leviticus 13:36
  then the priest shall examine him;
  and indeed if the scale has spread over the skin,
  the priest need not seek for yellow hair.

  He is unclean.

# Leviticus 13:37
  But if the scale appears to be at a standstill,
  and there is black hair grown up in it,
  the scale has healed.

  He is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

# Leviticus 13:38
  If a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body,
  specifically white bright spots,
# Leviticus 13:39
  then the priest shall look;
  and indeed
  if the bright spots on the skin of the body are dull white,
  it is a white spot that grows on the skin.

  He is clean.

# Leviticus 13:40
  As for the man whose hair has fallen from his head,
  he is bald, but he is clean.

# Leviticus 13:41
  He whose hair has fallen from his forehead,
  he is bald on the forehead, but he is clean.

# Leviticus 13:42
  And if there is on the bald head or bald forehead
  a reddish-white sore,
  it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or his bald forehead.

# Leviticus 13:43
  Then the priest shall examine it;
  and indeed if the swelling of the sore is reddish-white
  on his bald head or on his bald forehead,
  as the appearance of leprosy on the skin of the body,
# Leviticus 13:44
  he is a leprous man.

  He is unclean.

  The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean;
  his sore is on his head.

# Leviticus 13:45
  Now the leper on whom the sore is,
  his clothes shall be torn and his head bare;
  and he shall cover his mustache, and cry,
  {
    Unclean! Unclean!
  }

# Leviticus 13:46
  He shall be unclean.

  All the days he has the sore he shall be unclean.

  He is unclean, and he shall dwell alone;
  his dwelling shall be outside the camp.

# Leviticus 13:47
  Also, if a garment has a leprous plague in it,
  whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment,
# Leviticus 13:48
  whether it is in the warp or woof of linen or wool,
  whether in leather or in anything made of leather,
# Leviticus 13:49
  and if the plague is greenish or reddish
  in the garment or in the leather,
  whether in the warp or in the woof,
  or in anything made of leather,
  it is a leprous plague and shall be shown to the priest.

# Leviticus 13:50
  The priest shall examine the plague
  and isolate that which has the plague seven days.

# Leviticus 13:51
  And he shall examine the plague on the seventh day.

  If the plague has spread in the garment,
  either in the warp or in the woof,
  in the leather or in anything made of leather,
  the plague is an active leprosy.

  It is unclean.

# Leviticus 13:52
  He shall therefore burn that garment in which is the plague,
  whether warp or woof,
  in wool or in linen,
  or anything of leather,
  for it is an active leprosy;
  the garment shall be burned in the fire.

# Leviticus 13:53
  But if the priest examines it,
  and indeed the plague has not spread in the garment,
  either in the warp or in the woof,
  or in anything made of leather,
# Leviticus 13:54
  then the priest shall command
  that they wash the thing in which is the plague;
  and he shall isolate it another seven days.

# Leviticus 13:55
  Then the priest shall examine the plague
  after it has been washed;
  and indeed if the plague has not changed its color,
  though the plague has not spread, it is unclean,
  and you shall burn it in the fire;
  it continues eating away,
  whether the damage is outside or inside.

# Leviticus 13:56
  If the priest examines it,
  and indeed the plague has faded after washing it,
  then he shall tear it out of the garment,
  whether out of the warp or out of the woof,
  or out of the leather.

# Leviticus 13:57
  But if it appears again in the garment,
  either in the warp or in the woof,
  or in anything made of leather,
  it is a spreading plague;
  you shall burn with fire that in which is the plague.

# Leviticus 13:58
  And if you wash the garment,
  either warp or woof,
  or whatever is made of leather,
  if the plague has disappeared from it,
  then it shall be washed a second time,
  and shall be clean.

# Leviticus 13:59
  This is the law of the leprous plague
  in a garment of wool or linen,
  either in the warp or woof,
  or in anything made of leather,
  to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.

# Leviticus 14:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Leviticus 14:2
  This shall be the law of the leper for the day of his cleansing:
  He shall be brought to the priest.

# Leviticus 14:3
  And the priest shall go out of the camp,
  and the priest shall examine him;
  and indeed, if the leprosy is healed in the leper,
# Leviticus 14:4
  then the priest shall command
  to take for him who is to be cleansed
  two living and clean birds,
  cedar wood,
  scarlet,
  and hyssop.

# Leviticus 14:5
  And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed
  in an earthen vessel over running water.

# Leviticus 14:6
  As for the living bird, he shall take it,
  the cedar wood and the scarlet and the hyssop,
  and dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird
  that was killed over the running water.

# Leviticus 14:7
  And he shall sprinkle it seven times
  on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy,
  and shall pronounce him clean,
  and shall let the living bird loose in the open field.

# Leviticus 14:8
  He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes,
  shave off all his hair,
  and wash himself in water,
  that he may be clean.

  After that he shall come into the camp,
  and shall stay outside his tent seven days.

# Leviticus 14:9
  But on the seventh day he shall shave all the hair
  off his head and his beard and his eyebrows --
  all his hair he shall shave off.

  He shall wash his clothes and wash his body in water,
  But on the seventh day he shall shave all the hair
  and he shall be clean.

# Leviticus 14:10
  And on the eighth day
  he shall take two male lambs without blemish,
  one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish,
  three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour
  mixed with oil as a grain offering,
  and one log of oil.

# Leviticus 14:11
  Then the priest who makes him clean
  shall present the man who is to be made clean,
  and those things, before the Lord,
  at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Leviticus 14:12
  And the priest shall take one male lamb and offer it
  as a trespass offering,
  and the log of oil,
  and wave them as a wave offering before the Lord.

# Leviticus 14:13
  Then he shall kill the lamb
  in the place where he kills the sin offering
  and the burnt offering,
  in a holy place;
  for as the sin offering is the priest's,
  so is the trespass offering.

  It is most holy.

# Leviticus 14:14
  The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering,
  and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear
  of him who is to be cleansed,
  on the thumb of his right hand,
  and on the big toe of his right foot.

# Leviticus 14:15
  And the priest shall take some of the log of oil,
  and pour it into the palm of his own left hand.

# Leviticus 14:16
  Then the priest shall dip his right finger
  in the oil that is in his left hand,
  and shall sprinkle some of the oil with his finger
  seven times before the Lord.

# Leviticus 14:17
  And of the rest of the oil in his hand,
  the priest shall put some
  on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed,
  on the thumb of his right hand,
  and on the big toe of his right foot,
  on the blood of the trespass offering.

# Leviticus 14:18
  The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand
  he shall put on the head of him who is to be cleansed.

  So the priest shall make atonement for him before the Lord.

# Leviticus 14:19
  Then the priest shall offer the sin offering,
  and make atonement for him
  who is to be cleansed from his uncleanness.

  Afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.

# Leviticus 14:20
  And the priest shall offer the burnt offering
  and the grain offering
  on the altar.

  So the priest shall make atonement for him,
  and he shall be clean.

# Leviticus 14:21
  But if he is poor and cannot afford it,
  then he shall take one male lamb
  as a trespass offering to be waved,
  to make atonement for him,
  one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil
  as a grain offering,
  a log of oil,
# Leviticus 14:22
  and two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
  such as he is able to afford:
  one shall be a sin offering and the other a burnt offering.

  He shall bring them to the priest on the eighth day
  for his cleansing,
  to the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
  before the Lord.

  And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering
  and the log of oil,
  and the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the Lord.

  seven times before the Lord.

  with the grain offering.

# Leviticus 14:33
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
{

  When you have come into the land of Canaan,
  which I give you as a possession,
  and I put the leprous plague in a house
  in the land of your possession,
# Leviticus 14:35
  and he who owns the house comes and tells the priest,
  saying,
  {
    It seems to me that there is some plague in the house,
  }
# Leviticus 14:36
  then the priest shall command that they empty the house,
  before the priest goes into it to examine the plague,
  that all that is in the house may not be made unclean;
  and afterward the priest shall go in to examine the house.

# Leviticus 14:37
  And he shall examine the plague;
  and indeed if the plague is on the walls of the house
  with ingrained streaks,
  greenish or reddish,
  which appear to be deep in the wall,
# Leviticus 14:38
  then the priest shall go out of the house,
  to the door of the house,
  and shut up the house seven days.

# Leviticus 14:39
  And the priest shall come again on the seventh day and look;
  and indeed if the plague has spread on the walls of the house,
# Leviticus 14:40
  then the priest shall command that they take away the stones
  in which is the plague,
  and they shall cast them into an unclean place outside the city.

# Leviticus 14:41
  And he shall cause the house to be scraped inside, all around,
  and the dust that they scrape off
  they shall pour out in an unclean place outside the city.

# Leviticus 14:42
  Then they shall take other stones
  and put them in the place of those stones,
  and he shall take other mortar and plaster the house.

# Leviticus 14:43
  Now if the plague comes back and breaks out in the house,
  after he has taken away the stones,
  after he has scraped the house,
  and after it is plastered,
# Leviticus 14:44
  then the priest shall come and look;
  and indeed if the plague has spread in the house,
  it is an active leprosy in the house.

  It is unclean.

# Leviticus 14:45
  And he shall break down the house, its stones, its timber,
  and all the plaster of the house,
  and he shall carry them outside the city to an unclean place.

# Leviticus 14:46
  Moreover he who goes into the house at all
  while it is shut up shall be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 14:47
  And he who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes,
  and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.

# Leviticus 14:48
  But if the priest comes in and examines it,
  and indeed the plague has not spread in the house
  after the house was plastered,
  then the priest shall pronounce the house clean,
  because the plague is healed.

  And he shall take, to cleanse the house,
  two birds,
  cedar wood,
  scarlet,

  in an earthen vessel
  over running water;

  with the blood of the bird
  and the running water
  and the living bird,

And Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
{
# Leviticus 15:2
  Speak to the children of Israel,
  and say to them:
  {
    When any man has a discharge from his body,
    his discharge is unclean.

# Leviticus 15:3
    And this shall be his uncleanness
    in regard to his discharge --
    whether his body runs with his discharge,
    or his body is stopped up by his discharge,
    it is his uncleanness.

# Leviticus 15:4
    Every bed is unclean on which he who has the discharge lies,
    and everything on which he sits shall be unclean.

# Leviticus 15:5
    And whoever touches his bed
    shall wash his clothes and bathe in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:6
    He who sits on anything on which he who has the discharge sat
    shall wash his clothes and bathe in water,

    shall wash his clothes and bathe in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:8
    If he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean,
    then he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:9
    Any saddle on which he who has the discharge rides
    shall be unclean.

# Leviticus 15:10
    Whoever touches anything that was under him
    shall be unclean until evening.

    He who carries any of those things
    shall wash his clothes and bathe in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:11
    And whomever the one who has the discharge touches,
    and has not rinsed his hands in water,
    he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:12
    The vessel of earth that he who has the discharge touches
    shall be broken,
    and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

# Leviticus 15:13
    And when he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge,
    then he shall count for himself seven days for his cleansing,
    wash his clothes,
    and bathe his body in running water;
    then he shall be clean.

# Leviticus 15:14
    On the eighth day
    he shall take for himself
    two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
    and come before the Lord,
    to the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
    and give them to the priest.

# Leviticus 15:15
    Then the priest shall offer them,
    the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.

    So the priest shall make atonement for him
    before the Lord
    because of his discharge.

# Leviticus 15:16
    If any man has an emission of semen,
    then he shall wash all his body in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:17
    And any garment and any leather on which there is semen,
    it shall be washed with water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:18
    Also, when a woman lies with a man,
    and there is an emission of semen,
    they shall bathe in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:19
    If a woman has a discharge,
    and the discharge from her body is blood,
    she shall be set apart seven days;
    and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:20
    Everything that she lies on during her impurity
    shall be unclean;
    also everything that she sits on shall be unclean.

# Leviticus 15:21
    Whoever touches her bed
    shall wash his clothes and bathe in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:22
    And whoever touches anything that she sat on
    shall wash his clothes and bathe in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:23
    If anything is on her bed or on anything on which she sits,
    when he touches it,
    he shall be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:24
    And if any man lies with her at all,
    so that her impurity is on him,
    he shall be unclean seven days;
    and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.

# Leviticus 15:25
    If a woman has a discharge of blood for many days,
    other than at the time of her customary impurity,
    or if it runs beyond her usual time of impurity,
    all the days of her unclean discharge
    shall be as the days of her customary impurity.

    She shall be unclean.

# Leviticus 15:26
    Every bed on which she lies all the days of her discharge
    shall be to her as the bed of her impurity;
    and whatever she sits on shall be unclean,
    as the uncleanness of her impurity.

# Leviticus 15:27
    Whoever touches those things shall be unclean;
    he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water,
    and be unclean until evening.

# Leviticus 15:28
    But if she is cleansed of her discharge,
    then she shall count for herself seven days,
    and after that she shall be clean.

# Leviticus 15:29
    And on the eighth day
    she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons,
    and bring them to the priest,
    to the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Leviticus 15:30
    Then the priest shall offer the one as a sin offering
    and the other as a burnt offering,
    and the priest shall make atonement for her
    before the Lord
    for the discharge of her uncleanness.

# Leviticus 15:31
    Thus you shall separate the children of Israel
    from their uncleanness,
    lest they die in their uncleanness
    when they defile My tabernacle that is among them.

# Leviticus 15:32
    This is the law for one who has a discharge,
    and for him who emits semen and is unclean thereby,
# Leviticus 15:33
    and for her who is indisposed
    because of her customary impurity,
    and for one who has a discharge,
    either man or woman,
    and for him who lies with her who is unclean.

# Leviticus 16:1
Now the Lord spoke to Moses
after the death of the two sons of Aaron,
when they offered profane fire before the Lord, and died;
# Leviticus 16:2
and the Lord said to Moses:
{
  Tell Aaron your brother not to come at just any time
  into the Holy Place inside the veil,
  before the mercy seat which is on the ark,
  lest he die;
  for I will appear in the cloud above the mercy seat.

# Leviticus 16:3
  Thus Aaron shall come into the Holy Place:
    with the blood of a young bull as a sin offering,
    and of a ram as a burnt offering.

# Leviticus 16:4
  He shall put the holy linen tunic
  and the linen trousers on his body;
  he shall be girded with a linen sash,
  and with the linen turban he shall be attired.

  These are holy garments.

  Therefore he shall wash his body in water,
  and put them on.

# Leviticus 16:5
  And he shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel
  two kids of the goats as a sin offering,
  and one ram as a burnt offering.

# Leviticus 16:6
  Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering,
  which is for himself,
  and make atonement for himself and for his house.

# Leviticus 16:7
  He shall take the two goats and present them before the Lord
  at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Leviticus 16:8
  Then Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats:
    one lot for the Lord
    and the other lot for the scapegoat.

# Leviticus 16:9
  And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the Lord's lot fell,
  and offer it as a sin offering.

# Leviticus 16:10
  But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat
  shall be presented alive before the Lord,
  to make atonement upon it,
  and to let it go as the scapegoat into the wilderness.

# Leviticus 16:11
  And Aaron shall bring the bull of the sin offering,
  which is for himself,
  and make atonement for himself and for his house,
  and shall kill the bull as the sin offering
  which is for himself.

# Leviticus 16:12
  Then he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire
  from the altar before the Lord,
  with his hands full of sweet incense beaten fine,
  and bring it inside the veil.

# Leviticus 16:13
  And he shall put the incense on the fire before the Lord,
  that the cloud of incense may cover the mercy seat
  that is on the Testimony,
  lest he die.

# Leviticus 16:14
  He shall take some of the blood of the bull
  and sprinkle it
  with his finger
  on the mercy seat
  on the east side;
  and before the mercy seat
  he shall sprinkle some of the blood
  with his finger seven times.

# Leviticus 16:15
  Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering,
  which is for the people,
  bring its blood inside the veil,
  do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull,
  and sprinkle it on the mercy seat
  and before the mercy seat.

# Leviticus 16:16
  So he shall make atonement for the Holy Place,
  because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel,
  and because of their transgressions,
  for all their sins;
  and so he shall do for the tabernacle of meeting
  which remains among them
  in the midst of their uncleanness.

# Leviticus 16:17
  There shall be no man in the tabernacle of meeting
  when he goes in to make atonement in the Holy Place,
  until he comes out,
  that he may make atonement
  for himself,
  for his household,
  and for all the assembly of Israel.

# Leviticus 16:18
  And he shall go out to the altar that is before the Lord,
  and make atonement for it,
  and shall take some of the blood of the bull
  and some of the blood of the goat,
  and put it on the horns of the altar all around.

# Leviticus 16:19
  Then he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it
  with his finger seven times,
  cleanse it,
  and consecrate it
  from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.

# Leviticus 16:20
  And when he has made an end of atoning for the Holy Place,
  the tabernacle of meeting,
  and the altar,
  he shall bring the live goat.

# Leviticus 16:21
  Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat,
  confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
  and all their transgressions,
  concerning all their sins,
  putting them on the head of the goat,
  and shall send it away into the wilderness
  by the hand of a suitable man.

# Leviticus 16:22
  The goat shall bear on itself all their iniquities
  to an uninhabited land;
  and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.

# Leviticus 16:23
  Then Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of meeting,
  shall take off the linen garments which he put on
  when he went into the Holy Place,
  and shall leave them there.

# Leviticus 16:24
  And he shall wash his body with water in a holy place,
  put on his garments,
  come out and offer his burnt offering
  and the burnt offering of the people,
  and make atonement for himself and for the people.

# Leviticus 16:25
  The fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.

# Leviticus 16:26
  And he who released the goat as the scapegoat
  shall wash his clothes
  and bathe his body in water,
  and afterward he may come into the camp.

# Leviticus 16:27
  The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering,
  whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place,
  shall be carried outside the camp.

  And they shall burn in the fire
  their skins, their flesh, and their offal.

# Leviticus 16:28
  Then he who burns them
  shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water,
  and afterward he may come into the camp.

# Leviticus 16:29
  This shall be a statute forever for you:
    In the seventh month,
    on the tenth day of the month,
    you shall afflict your souls,
    and do no work at all,
    whether a native of your own country
    or a stranger who dwells among you.

# Leviticus 16:30
  For on that day the priest shall make atonement for you,
  to cleanse you,
  that you may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.

# Leviticus 16:31
  It is a sabbath of solemn rest for you,
  and you shall afflict your souls.

  It is a statute forever.

# Leviticus 16:32
  And the priest,
  who is anointed and consecrated to minister as priest
  in his father's place,
  shall make atonement,
  and put on the linen clothes,
  the holy garments;
# Leviticus 16:33
  then he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary,
  and he shall make atonement
  for the tabernacle of meeting and for the altar,
  and he shall make atonement for the priests
  and for all the people of the assembly.

# Leviticus 16:34
  This shall be an everlasting statute for you,
  to make atonement for the children of Israel,
  for all their sins,
  once a year.

And he did as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Leviticus 17:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Leviticus 17:2
  Speak to Aaron, to his sons,
  and to all the children of Israel,
  and say to them,
  {
    This is the thing which the Lord has commanded, saying:
    {
# Leviticus 17:3
      Whatever man of the house of Israel
      who kills an ox or lamb or goat in the camp,
      or who kills it outside the camp,
# Leviticus 17:4
      and does not bring it
      to the door of the tabernacle of meeting
      to offer an offering to the Lord
      before the tabernacle of the Lord,
      the guilt of bloodshed shall be imputed to that man.

# Leviticus 17:5
      He has shed blood;
      and that man shall be cut off from among his people,
# Leviticus 17:6
      to the end that the children of Israel
      may bring their sacrifices
      which they offer in the open field,
      that they may bring them to the Lord
      at the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
      to the priest,
      and offer them as peace offerings to the Lord.

# Leviticus 17:7
      And the priest shall sprinkle the blood
      on the altar of the Lord
      at the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
      and burn the fat
      for a sweet aroma
      to the Lord.

# Leviticus 17:8
      They shall no more offer their sacrifices to demons,
      after whom they have played the harlot.

      This shall be a statute forever for them
      throughout their generations.
    }
  }

# Leviticus 17:9
  Also you shall say to them:
  {
    Whatever man of the house of Israel,
    or of the strangers who dwell among you,
    who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,
# Leviticus 17:10
    and does not bring it
    to the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
    to offer it to the Lord,
    that man shall be cut off from among his people.

# Leviticus 17:11
    And whatever man of the house of Israel,
    or of the strangers who dwell among you,
    who eats any blood,
    I will set My face against that person who eats blood,
    and will cut him off from among his people.

# Leviticus 17:12
    For the life of the flesh is in the blood,
    and I have given it to you upon the altar
    to make atonement for your souls;
    for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul.
  }

# Leviticus 17:13
  Therefore I said to the children of Israel,
  {
    No one among you shall eat blood,
    nor shall any stranger who dwells among you eat blood.
  }

# Leviticus 17:14
  Whatever man of the children of Israel,
  or of the strangers who dwell among you,
  who hunts and catches any animal or bird that may be eaten,
  he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust;
# Leviticus 17:15
  for it is the life of all flesh.

  Its blood sustains its life.

  Therefore I said to the children of Israel,
  {
    You shall not eat the blood of any flesh,
    for the life of all flesh is its blood.

    Whoever eats it shall be cut off.
  }

# Leviticus 17:16
  And every person who eats what died naturally
  or what was torn by beasts,
  whether he is a native of your own country or a stranger,
  he shall both wash his clothes and bathe in water,
  and be unclean until evening.

  Then he shall be clean.

# Leviticus 17:17
  But if he does not wash them or bathe his body,
  then he shall bear his guilt.
}

# Leviticus 18:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Leviticus 18:2
  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:
  {
    I am the Lord your God.

# Leviticus 18:3
    According to the doings of the land of Egypt,
    where you dwelt,
    you shall not do;
    and according to the doings of the land of Canaan,
    where I am bringing you,
    you shall not do;
    nor shall you walk in their ordinances.

# Leviticus 18:4
    You shall observe My judgments and keep My ordinances,
    to walk in them:
      I am the Lord your God.

# Leviticus 18:5
    You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments,
    which if a man does,
    he shall live by them:
      I am the Lord.

# Leviticus 18:6
    None of you shall approach anyone who is near of kin to him,
    to uncover his nakedness:
      I am the Lord.

# Leviticus 18:7
    The nakedness of your father or the nakedness of your mother
    you shall not uncover.

    She is your mother;
    you shall not uncover her nakedness.

# Leviticus 18:8
    The nakedness of your father's wife you shall not uncover;
    it is your father's nakedness.

# Leviticus 18:9
    The nakedness of your sister,
    the daughter of your father,
    or the daughter of your mother,
    whether born at home or elsewhere,
    their nakedness you shall not uncover.

# Leviticus 18:10
    The nakedness of your son's daughter
    or your daughter's daughter,
    their nakedness you shall not uncover;
    for theirs is your own nakedness.

# Leviticus 18:11
    The nakedness of your father's wife's daughter,
    begotten by your father --
    she is your sister --
    you shall not uncover her nakedness.

# Leviticus 18:12
    You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister;
    she is near of kin to your father.

# Leviticus 18:13
    You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister,
    for she is near of kin to your mother.

# Leviticus 18:14
    You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother.

    You shall not approach his wife;
    she is your aunt.

    You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law --
    she is your son's wife --
    you shall not uncover her nakedness.

# Leviticus 18:16
    You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother's wife;
    it is your brother's nakedness.

    You shall not uncover the nakedness
    of a woman and her daughter,
    nor shall you take her son's daughter
    or her daughter's daughter,

    Nor shall you take a woman as a rival to her sister,
    to uncover her nakedness while the other is alive.

    Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness
    as long as she is in her customary impurity.

    Moreover you shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife,
    to defile yourself with her.

    And you shall not let any of your descendants
    pass through the fire to Molech,
    nor shall you profane the name of your God:
      I am the Lord.

    You shall not lie with a male as with a woman.

    It is an abomination.

# Leviticus 18:23
    Nor shall you mate with any animal,
    to defile yourself with it.

    Nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate with it.

    It is perversion.

    Do not defile yourselves with any of these things;
    for by all these the nations are defiled,
    which I am casting out before you.

# Leviticus 18:25
    For the land is defiled;
    therefore I visit the punishment of its iniquity upon it,
    and the land vomits out its inhabitants.

    You shall therefore keep My statutes and My judgments,
    and shall not commit any of these abominations,
    either any of your own nation
    or any stranger who dwells among you

    For whoever commits any of these abominations,
    the persons who commit them
    shall be cut off from among their people.

# Leviticus 18:30
    Therefore you shall keep My ordinance,

    to the Lord,
    a burnt offering and a grain offering,
    a sacrifice and drink offerings,
    everything on its day --
# Leviticus 23:38
    besides the Sabbaths of the Lord,
    besides your gifts,
    besides all your vows,
    and besides all your freewill offerings
    which you give to the Lord.

# Leviticus 23:39
    Also on the fifteenth day of the seventh month,
    when you have gathered in the fruit of the land,
    you shall keep the feast of the Lord for seven days;
    on the first day there shall be a sabbath-rest,
    and on the eighth day a sabbath-rest.

# Leviticus 23:40
    And you shall take for yourselves
    on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees,
    branches of palm trees,
    the boughs of leafy trees,
    and willows of the brook;
    and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days.

# Leviticus 23:41
    You shall keep it as a feast to the Lord
    for seven days in the year.

    It shall be a statute forever in your generations.

    You shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

# Leviticus 23:42
    You shall dwell in booths for seven days.

    All who are native Israelites shall dwell in booths,
# Leviticus 23:43
    that your generations may know
    that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths
    when I brought them out of the land of Egypt:
      I am the Lord your God.
  }
}

# Leviticus 23:44
So Moses declared to the children of Israel
the feasts of the Lord.

# Leviticus 24:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Leviticus 24:2
  Command the children of Israel
  that they bring to you pure oil of pressed olives
  for the light,
  to make the lamps burn continually.

# Leviticus 24:3
  Outside the veil of the Testimony,
  in the tabernacle of meeting,
  Aaron shall be in charge of it
  from evening until morning
  before the Lord continually;
  it shall be a statute forever in your generations.

# Leviticus 24:4
  He shall be in charge of the lamps on the pure gold lampstand
  before the Lord continually.

# Leviticus 24:5
  And you shall take fine flour and bake 12 cakes with it.

  Two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake.

# Leviticus 24:6
  You shall set them in two rows,
  six in a row,
  on the pure gold table before the Lord.

# Leviticus 24:7
  And you shall put pure frankincense on each row,
  that it may be on the bread for a memorial,
  an offering
  made by fire
  to the Lord.

# Leviticus 24:8
  Every Sabbath he shall set it in order
  before the Lord continually,
  being taken from the children of Israel
  by an everlasting covenant.

# Leviticus 24:9
  And it shall be for Aaron and his sons,
  and they shall eat it in a holy place;
  for it is most holy to him
  from the offerings of the Lord
  made by fire,
  by a perpetual statute.
}

# Leviticus 24:10
Now the son of an Israelite woman,
whose father was an Egyptian,
went out among the children of Israel;
and this Israelite woman's son and a man of Israel
fought each other in the camp.

# Leviticus 24:11
And the Israelite woman's son
blasphemed the name of the Lord and cursed;
and so they brought him to Moses.

(His mother's name was Shelomith the daughter of Dibri,
of the tribe of Dan.)

# Leviticus 24:12
Then they put him in custody,
that the mind of the Lord might be shown to them.

# Leviticus 24:13
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Leviticus 24:14
  Take outside the camp him who has cursed;
  then let all who heard him lay their hands on his head,
  and let all the congregation stone him.

# Leviticus 24:15
  Then you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying:
  {
    Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.

# Leviticus 24:16
    And whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord
    shall surely be put to death.

    All the congregation shall certainly stone him,
    the stranger as well as him who is born in the land.

    When he blasphemes the name of the Lord,
    he shall be put to death.

# Leviticus 24:17
    Whoever kills any man shall surely be put to death.

# Leviticus 24:18
    Whoever kills an animal shall make it good,
    animal for animal.

# Leviticus 24:19
    If a man causes disfigurement of his neighbor,
    as he has done,
    so shall it be done to him --
# Leviticus 24:20
    fracture for fracture,
    eye for eye,
    tooth for tooth;
    as he has caused disfigurement of a man,
    so shall it be done to him.

# Leviticus 24:21
    And whoever kills an animal shall restore it;
    but whoever kills a man shall be put to death.

# Leviticus 24:22
    You shall have the same law for the stranger
    and for one from your own country;
    for I am the Lord your God.
  }
}

# Leviticus 24:23
Then Moses spoke to the children of Israel;
and they took outside the camp him who had cursed,
and stoned him with stones.

So the children of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Leviticus 25:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,
{
# Leviticus 25:2
  Speak to the children of Israel,
  and say to them:
  {
    When you come into the land which I give you,
    then the land shall keep a sabbath to the Lord.

# Leviticus 25:3
    Six years you shall sow your field,
    and six years you shall prune your vineyard,
    and gather its fruit;
# Leviticus 25:4
    but in the seventh year
    there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land,
    a sabbath to the Lord.

    You shall neither sow your field nor prune your vineyard.

# Leviticus 25:5
    What grows of its own accord of your harvest
    you shall not reap,
    nor gather the grapes of your untended vine,
    for it is a year of rest for the land.

# Leviticus 25:6
    And the sabbath produce of the land shall be food for you:
      for you,
      your male and female servants,
      your hired man,
      and the stranger who dwells with you,
# Leviticus 25:7
      for your livestock and the beasts that are in your land --
      all its produce shall be for food.

# Leviticus 25:8
    And you shall count seven sabbaths of years for yourself,
    seven times seven years;
    and the time of the seven sabbaths of years
    shall be to you 49 years.

# Leviticus 25:9
    Then you shall cause the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound
    on the tenth day of the seventh month;
    on the Day of Atonement you shall make the trumpet to sound
    throughout all your land.

# Leviticus 25:10
    And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year,
    and proclaim liberty
    throughout all the land to all its inhabitants.

    It shall be a Jubilee for you;
    and each of you shall return to his possession,
    and each of you shall return to his family.

# Leviticus 25:11
    That fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee to you;
    in it you shall neither sow nor reap
    what grows of its own accord,
    nor gather the grapes of your untended vine.

# Leviticus 25:12
    For it is the Jubilee;
    it shall be holy to you;
    you shall eat its produce from the field.

# Leviticus 25:13
    In this Year of Jubilee,
    each of you shall return to his possession.

# Leviticus 25:14
    And if you sell anything to your neighbor
    or buy from your neighbor's hand,
    you shall not oppress one another.

# Leviticus 25:15
    According to the number of years after the Jubilee
    you shall buy from your neighbor,
    and according to the number of years of crops
    he shall sell to you.

# Leviticus 25:16
    According to the multitude of years
    you shall increase its price,
    and according to the fewer number of years
    you shall diminish its price;
    for he sells to you
    according to the number of the years of the crops.

# Leviticus 25:17
    Therefore you shall not oppress one another,
    but you shall fear your God;
    for I am the Lord your God.

# Leviticus 25:18
    So you shall observe My statutes and keep My judgments,
    and perform them;
    and you will dwell in the land in safety.

# Leviticus 25:19
    Then the land will yield its fruit,
    and you will eat your fill,
    and dwell there in safety.

# Leviticus 25:20
    And if you say,
    {
      What shall we eat in the seventh year,
      since we shall not sow nor gather in our produce?
    }

# Leviticus 25:21
    Then I will command My blessing on you in the sixth year,
    and it will bring forth produce enough for three years.

# Leviticus 25:22
    And you shall sow in the eighth year,
    and eat old produce until the ninth year;
    until its produce comes in,
    you shall eat of the old harvest.

# Leviticus 25:23
    The land shall not be sold permanently,
    for the land is Mine;
    for you are strangers and sojourners with Me.

# Leviticus 25:24
    And in all the land of your possession
    you shall grant redemption of the land.

# Leviticus 25:25
    If one of your brethren becomes poor,
    and has sold some of his possession,
    and if his redeeming relative comes to redeem it,
    then he may redeem what his brother sold.

# Leviticus 25:26
    Or if the man has no one to redeem it,
    but he himself becomes able to redeem it,
# Leviticus 25:27
    then let him count the years since its sale,
    and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it,
    that he may return to his possession.

# Leviticus 25:28
    But if he is not able to have it restored to himself,
    then what was sold
    shall remain in the hand of him who bought it
    until the Year of Jubilee;
    and in the Jubilee it shall be released,
    and he shall return to his possession.

# Leviticus 25:29
    If a man sells a house in a walled city,
    then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold;
    within a full year he may redeem it.

# Leviticus 25:30
    But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year,
    then the house in the walled city
    shall belong permanently to him who bought it,
    throughout his generations.

    It shall not be released in the Jubilee.

# Leviticus 25:31
    However the houses of villages
    which have no wall around them
    shall be counted as the fields of the country.

    They may be redeemed,
    and they shall be released in the Jubilee.

# Leviticus 25:32
    Nevertheless the cities of the Levites,
    and the houses in the cities of their possession,
    the Levites may redeem at any time.

# Leviticus 25:33
    And if a man purchases a house from the Levites,
    then the house that was sold in the city of his possession
    shall be released in the Jubilee;
    for the houses in the cities of the Levites
    are their possession among the children of Israel.

# Leviticus 25:34
    But the field of the common-land of their cities
    may not be sold,
    for it is their perpetual possession.

# Leviticus 25:35
    If one of your brethren becomes poor,
    and falls into poverty among you,
    then you shall help him,
    like a stranger or a sojourner,
    that he may live with you.

# Leviticus 25:36
    Take no usury or interest from him;
    but fear your God,
    that your brother may live with you.

# Leviticus 25:37
    You shall not lend him your money for usury,
    nor lend him your food at a profit.

# Leviticus 25:38
    I am the Lord your God,
    who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
    to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.

# Leviticus 25:39
    And if one of your brethren who dwells by you becomes poor,
    and sells himself to you,
    you shall not compel him to serve as a slave.

# Leviticus 25:40
    As a hired servant and a sojourner he shall be with you,
    and shall serve you until the Year of Jubilee.

# Leviticus 25:41
    And then he shall depart from you --
    he and his children with him --
    and shall return to his own family.

    He shall return to the possession of his fathers.

# Leviticus 25:42
    For they are My servants,
    whom I brought out of the land of Egypt;
    they shall not be sold as slaves.

# Leviticus 25:43
    You shall not rule over him with rigor,
    but you shall fear your God.

# Leviticus 25:44
    And as for your male and female slaves whom you may have --
    from the nations that are around you,
    from them you may buy male and female slaves.

# Leviticus 25:45
    Moreover you may buy the children of the strangers
    who dwell among you,
    and their families who are with you,
    which they beget in your land;
    and they shall become your property.

# Leviticus 25:46
    And you may take them as an inheritance
    for your children after you,
    to inherit them as a possession;
    they shall be your permanent slaves.

    But regarding your brethren, the children of Israel,
    you shall not rule over one another with rigor.

# Leviticus 25:47
    Now if a sojourner or stranger close to you becomes rich,
    and one of your brethren who dwells by him becomes poor,
    and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner close to you,
    or to a member of the stranger's family,
# Leviticus 25:48
    after he is sold he may be redeemed again.

    One of his brothers may redeem him;
# Leviticus 25:49
    or his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him;
    or anyone who is near of kin to him
    in his family may redeem him;
    or if he is able he may redeem himself.

# Leviticus 25:50
    Thus he shall reckon with him who bought him:
      The price of his release
      shall be according to the number of years,
      from the year that he was sold to him
      until the Year of Jubilee;
      it shall be
      according to the time of a hired servant for him.

# Leviticus 25:51
    If there are still many years remaining,
    according to them he shall repay the price of his redemption
    from the money with which he was bought.

# Leviticus 25:52
    And if there remain but a few years
    until the Year of Jubilee,
    then he shall reckon with him,
    and according to his years
    he shall repay him the price of his redemption.

# Leviticus 25:53
    He shall be with him as a yearly hired servant,
    and he shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight.

# Leviticus 25:54
    And if he is not redeemed in these years,
    then he shall be released in the Year of Jubilee --
    he and his children with him.

# Leviticus 25:55
    For the children of Israel are servants to Me;
    they are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt:
      I am the Lord your God.

# Leviticus 26:1
    You shall not make idols for yourselves;
    neither a carved image nor a sacred pillar
    shall you rear up for yourselves;
    nor shall you set up an engraved stone in your land,
    to bow down to it;
    for I am the Lord your God.

# Leviticus 26:2
    You shall keep My Sabbaths and reverence My sanctuary:
      I am the Lord.

# Leviticus 26:3
    If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments,
    and perform them,
# Leviticus 26:4
    then I will give you rain in its season,
    the land shall yield its produce,
    and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.

# Leviticus 26:5
    Your threshing shall last till the time of vintage,
    and the vintage shall last till the time of sowing;
    you shall eat your bread to the full,
    and dwell in your land safely.

# Leviticus 26:6
    I will give peace in the land,
    and you shall lie down,
    and none will make you afraid;
    I will rid the land of evil beasts,
    and the sword will not go through your land.

# Leviticus 26:7
    You will chase your enemies,
    and they shall fall by the sword before you.

# Leviticus 26:8
    Five of you shall chase a hundred,
    and a hundred of you shall put 10,000 to flight;
    your enemies shall fall by the sword before you.

# Leviticus 26:9
    For I will look on you favorably and make you fruitful,
    multiply you and confirm My covenant with you.

# Leviticus 26:10
    You shall eat the old harvest,
    and clear out the old because of the new.

# Leviticus 26:11
    I will set My tabernacle among you,
    and My soul shall not abhor you.

# Leviticus 26:12
    I will walk among you and be your God,
    and you shall be My people.

# Leviticus 26:13
    I am the Lord your God,
    who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
    that you should not be their slaves;
    I have broken the bands of your yoke
    and made you walk upright.

# Leviticus 26:14
    But if you do not obey Me,
    and do not observe all these commandments,
# Leviticus 26:15
    and if you despise My statutes,
    or if your soul abhors My judgments,
    so that you do not perform all My commandments,
    but break My covenant,
# Leviticus 26:16
    I also will do this to you:
    I will even appoint terror over you,
    wasting disease and fever
    which shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart.

    And you shall sow your seed in vain,
    for your enemies shall eat it.

# Leviticus 26:17
    I will set My face against you,
    and you shall be defeated by your enemies.

    Those who hate you shall reign over you,
    and you shall flee when no one pursues you.

# Leviticus 26:18
    And after all this, if you do not obey Me,
    then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.

# Leviticus 26:19
    I will break the pride of your power;
    I will make your heavens like iron
    and your earth like bronze.

# Leviticus 26:20
    And your strength shall be spent in vain;
    for your land shall not yield its produce,
    nor shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.

# Leviticus 26:21
    Then, if you walk contrary to Me,
    and are not willing to obey Me,
    I will bring on you seven times more plagues,
    according to your sins.

# Leviticus 26:22
    I will also send wild beasts among you,
    which shall rob you of your children,
    destroy your livestock,
    and make you few in number;
    and your highways shall be desolate.

# Leviticus 26:23
    And if by these things you are not reformed by Me,
    but walk contrary to Me,
# Leviticus 26:24
    then I also will walk contrary to you,
    and I will punish you yet seven times for your sins.

# Leviticus 26:25
    And I will bring a sword against you
    that will execute the vengeance of the covenant;
    when you are gathered together within your cities
    I will send pestilence among you;
    and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

# Leviticus 26:26
    When I have cut off your supply of bread,
    10 women shall bake your bread in one oven,
    and they shall bring back your bread by weight,
    and you shall eat and not be satisfied.

# Leviticus 26:27
    And after all this,
    if you do not obey Me,
    but walk contrary to Me,
# Leviticus 26:28
    then I also will walk contrary to you in fury;
    and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

# Leviticus 26:29
    You shall eat the flesh of your sons,
    and you shall eat the flesh of your daughters.

# Leviticus 26:30
    I will destroy your high places,
    cut down your incense altars,
    and cast your carcasses on the lifeless forms of your idols;
    and My soul shall abhor you.

# Leviticus 26:31
    I will lay your cities waste
    and bring your sanctuaries to desolation,
    and I will not smell the fragrance of your sweet aromas.

# Leviticus 26:32
    I will bring the land to desolation,
    and your enemies who dwell in it shall be astonished at it.

# Leviticus 26:33
    I will scatter you among the nations
    and draw out a sword after you;
    your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.

# Leviticus 26:34
    Then the land shall enjoy its sabbaths
    as long as it lies desolate
    and you are in your enemies' land;
    then the land shall rest and enjoy its sabbaths.

# Leviticus 26:35
    As long as it lies desolate it shall rest --
    for the time it did not rest on your sabbaths
    when you dwelt in it.

# Leviticus 26:36
    And as for those of you who are left,
    I will send faintness into their hearts
    in the lands of their enemies;
    the sound of a shaken leaf shall cause them to flee;
    they shall flee as though fleeing from a sword,
    and they shall fall when no one pursues.

# Leviticus 26:37
    They shall stumble over one another,
    as it were before a sword,
    when no one pursues;
    and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

# Leviticus 26:38
    You shall perish among the nations,
    and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.

# Leviticus 26:39
    And those of you who are left shall waste away
    in their iniquity in your enemies' lands;
    also in their fathers' iniquities,
    which are with them,
    they shall waste away.

# Leviticus 26:40
    But if they confess their iniquity
    and the iniquity of their fathers,
    with their unfaithfulness
    in which they were unfaithful to Me,
    and that they also have walked contrary to Me,
# Leviticus 26:41
    and that I also have walked contrary to them
    and have brought them into the land of their enemies;
    if their uncircumcised hearts are humbled,
    and they accept their guilt --
# Leviticus 26:42
    then I will remember My covenant with Jacob,
    and My covenant with Isaac
    and My covenant with Abraham I will remember;
    I will remember the land.

# Leviticus 26:43
    The land also shall be left empty by them,
    and will enjoy its sabbaths
    while it lies desolate without them;
    they will accept their guilt,
    because they despised My judgments
    and because their soul abhorred My statutes.

# Leviticus 26:44
    Yet for all that,
    when they are in the land of their enemies,
    I will not cast them away,
    nor shall I abhor them,
    to utterly destroy them and break My covenant with them;
    for I am the Lord their God.

# Leviticus 26:45
    But for their sake
    I will remember the covenant of their ancestors,
    whom I brought out of the land of Egypt
    in the sight of the nations,
    that I might be their God:
      I am the Lord.

}

# Leviticus 26:46
These are the statutes and judgments and laws which the Lord made
between Himself and the children of Israel on Mount Sinai
by the hand of Moses.

# Leviticus 27:1
Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Leviticus 27:2
  Speak to the children of Israel,
  and say to them:
  {
    When a man consecrates by a vow certain persons to the Lord,
    according to your valuation,
# Leviticus 27:3
    if your valuation is of a male
    from 20 years old up to 60 years old,
    then your valuation shall be 50 shekels of silver,
    according to the shekel of the sanctuary.

# Leviticus 27:4
    If it is a female,
    then your valuation shall be 30 shekels;
# Leviticus 27:5
    and if from five years old up to 20 years old,
    then your valuation for a male shall be 20 shekels,
    and for a female 10 shekels;
# Leviticus 27:6
    and if from a month old up to five years old,
    then your valuation for a male
    shall be five shekels of silver,
    and for a female your valuation
    shall be three shekels of silver;
# Leviticus 27:7
    and if from 60 years old and above,
    if it is a male,
    then your valuation shall be 15 shekels,
    and for a female 10 shekels.

# Leviticus 27:8
    But if he is too poor to pay your valuation,
    then he shall present himself before the priest,
    and the priest shall set a value for him;
    according to the ability of him who vowed,
    the priest shall value him.

# Leviticus 27:9
    If it is an animal
    that men may bring as an offering to the Lord,
    all that anyone gives to the Lord shall be holy.

# Leviticus 27:10
    He shall not substitute it or exchange it,
    good for bad or bad for good;
    and if he at all exchanges animal for animal,
    then both it and the one exchanged for it shall be holy.

# Leviticus 27:11
    If it is an unclean animal
    which they do not offer as a sacrifice to the Lord,
    then he shall present the animal before the priest;
# Leviticus 27:12
    and the priest shall set a value for it,
    whether it is good or bad;
    as you, the priest, value it, so it shall be.

# Leviticus 27:13
    But if he wants at all to redeem it,
    then he must add one-fifth to your valuation.

# Leviticus 27:14
    And when a man dedicates his house to be holy to the Lord,
    then the priest shall set a value for it,
    whether it is good or bad;
    as the priest values it,
    so it shall stand.

# Leviticus 27:15
    If he who dedicated it wants to redeem his house,
    then he must add one-fifth of the money of your valuation
    to it,
    and it shall be his.

# Leviticus 27:16
    If a man dedicates to the Lord
    part of a field of his possession,
    then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it.

    A homer of barley seed
    shall be valued at 50 shekels of silver.

# Leviticus 27:17
    If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee,
    according to your valuation it shall stand.

# Leviticus 27:18
    But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee,
    then the priest shall reckon to him the money due
    according to the years that remain till the Year of Jubilee,
    and it shall be deducted from your valuation.

# Leviticus 27:19
    And if he who dedicates the field ever wishes to redeem it,
    then he must add one-fifth of the money of your valuation
    to it,
    and it shall belong to him.

# Leviticus 27:20
    But if he does not want to redeem the field,
    or if he has sold the field to another man,
    it shall not be redeemed anymore;
# Leviticus 27:21
    but the field,
    when it is released in the Jubilee,
    shall be holy to the Lord,
    as a devoted field;
    it shall be the possession of the priest.

# Leviticus 27:22
    And if a man dedicates to the Lord a field which he has bought,
    which is not the field of his possession,
# Leviticus 27:23
    then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation,
    up to the Year of Jubilee,
    and he shall give your valuation on that day
    as a holy offering to the Lord.

# Leviticus 27:24
    In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him
    from whom it was bought,
    to the one who owned the land as a possession.

# Leviticus 27:25
    And all your valuations
    shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary:
      20 gerahs to the shekel.

# Leviticus 27:26
    But the firstborn of the animals,
    which should be the Lord's firstborn,
    no man shall dedicate;
    whether it is an ox or sheep,
    it is the Lord's.

# Leviticus 27:27
    And if it is an unclean animal,
    then he shall redeem it according to your valuation,
    and shall add one-fifth to it;
    or if it is not redeemed,
    then it shall be sold according to your valuation.

# Leviticus 27:28
    Nevertheless no devoted offering
    that a man may devote to the Lord of all that he has,
    both man and beast,
    or the field of his possession,
    shall be sold or redeemed;
    every devoted offering is most holy to the Lord.

# Leviticus 27:29
    No person under the ban,
    who may become doomed to destruction among men,
    shall be redeemed,
    but shall surely be put to death.

# Leviticus 27:30
    And all the tithe of the land,
    whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree,
    is the Lord's.

    It is holy to the Lord.

# Leviticus 27:31
    If a man wants at all to redeem any of his tithes,
    he shall add one-fifth to it.

# Leviticus 27:32
    And concerning the tithe of the herd or the flock,
    of whatever passes under the rod,
    the tenth one shall be holy to the Lord.

# Leviticus 27:33
    He shall not inquire whether it is good or bad,
    nor shall he exchange it;
    and if he exchanges it at all,
    then both it and the one exchanged for it shall be holy;
    it shall not be redeemed.
