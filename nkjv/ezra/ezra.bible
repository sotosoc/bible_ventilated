# Ezra 1:1
Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia,
that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah
might be fulfilled,
the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia,
so that he made a proclamation
throughout all his kingdom,
and also put it in writing,
saying,

# Ezra 1:2
Thus says Cyrus king of Persia:

  All the kingdoms of the earth
  the Lord God of heaven has given me.

  And He has commanded me
  to build Him a house at Jerusalem
  which is in Judah.

# Ezra 1:3
  Who is among you of all His people?

  May his God be with him,
  and let him go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah,
  and build the house of the Lord God of Israel
  (He is God),
  which is in Jerusalem.

# Ezra 1:4
  And whoever is left in any place where he dwells,
  let the men of his place help him with silver and gold,
  with goods and livestock,
  besides the freewill offerings
  for the house of God
  which is in Jerusalem.

# Ezra 1:5
Then the heads of the fathers' houses
of Judah and Benjamin,
and the priests and the Levites,
with all whose spirits God had moved,
arose to go up
and build the house of the Lord
which is in Jerusalem.

# Ezra 1:6
And all those who were around them encouraged them
with articles of silver and gold,
with goods and livestock,
and with precious things,
besides all that was willingly offered.

# Ezra 1:7
King Cyrus also brought out the articles of the house of the Lord,
which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem
and put in the temple of his gods;
# Ezra 1:8
and Cyrus king of Persia brought them out
by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer,
and counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.

# Ezra 1:9
This is the number of them:
30 gold platters,
1000 silver platters,
29 knives,
# Ezra 1:10
30 gold basins,
410 silver basins of a similar kind,
and 1000 other articles.

# Ezra 1:11
All the articles of gold and silver were 5400.

All these Sheshbazzar took with the captives
who were brought from Babylon to Jerusalem.

# Ezra 2:1
Now these are the people of the province who came back from the captivity,
of those who had been carried away,
whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon,
and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah,
everyone to his own city.

# Ezra 2:2
Those who came with Zerubbabel were Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,
Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah.

and the sons of Shobai,                                139 in all.

# Ezra 2:44
The Nethinim:

the sons of Rezin,
the sons of Nekoda,
the sons of Gazzam,
# Ezra 2:50
the sons of Uzza,
the sons of Paseah,

the sons of Sophereth,
the sons of Peruda,
# Ezra 2:57
the sons of Jaala,
the sons of Darkon,
the sons of Giddel,
# Ezra 2:58
the sons of Shephatiah,
the sons of Hattil,
the sons of Pochereth of Zebaim,
and the sons of Ami.

# Ezra 2:59
All the Nethinim and the children of Solomon's servants were 392.

# Ezra 2:60
And these were the ones who came up
from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer;
but they could not identify their father's house or their genealogy,
whether they were of Israel:
# Ezra 2:61
the sons of Delaiah,
the sons of Tobiah,
and the sons of Nekoda, 652;
# Ezra 2:62
and of the sons of the priests:
the sons of Habaiah,
the sons of Koz,
and the sons of Barzillai,
who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite,
and was called by their name.

# Ezra 2:63
These sought their listing among those who were registered by genealogy,
but they were not found;
therefore they were excluded from the priesthood as defiled.

# Ezra 2:64
And the governor said to them
that they should not eat of the most holy things
till a priest could consult with the Urim and Thummim.

# Ezra 2:65
The whole assembly together was 42360,
# Ezra 2:66
besides their male and female servants,
of whom there were 7337;
and they had 200 men and women singers.

# Ezra 2:67
Their horses were 736,
their mules 245,
# Ezra 2:68
their camels 435,
and their donkeys 6720.

# Ezra 2:69
Some of the heads of the fathers' houses,
when they came to the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem,
offered freely for the house of God,
to erect it in its place:

# Ezra 2:70
According to their ability,
they gave to the treasury for the work 61,000 gold drachmas,
5000 minas of silver,
and 100 priestly garments.

# Ezra 2:71
So the priests and the Levites,
some of the people,
the singers,
the gatekeepers,
and the Nethinim,
dwelt in their cities,
and all Israel in their cities.

# Ezra 3:1
And when the seventh month had come,
and the children of Israel were in the cities,
the people gathered together as one man to Jerusalem.

# Ezra 3:2
Then Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brethren the priests,
and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brethren,
arose and built the altar of the God of Israel,
to offer burnt offerings on it,
as it is written in the Law of Moses the man of God.

# Ezra 3:3
Though fear had come upon them because of the people of those countries,
they set the altar on its bases;
and they offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord,
both the morning and evening burnt offerings.

# Ezra 3:4
They also kept the Feast of Tabernacles, as it is written,
and offered the daily burnt offerings
in the number required by ordinance for each day.

# Ezra 3:5
Afterwards they offered the regular burnt offering,
and those for New Moons
and for all the appointed feasts of the Lord that were consecrated,
and those of everyone who willingly offered a freewill offering to the Lord.

# Ezra 3:6
From the first day of the seventh month
they began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord,
although the foundation of the temple of the Lord had not been laid.

# Ezra 3:7
They also gave money to the masons and the carpenters,
and food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre
to bring cedar logs from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa,
according to the permission which they had from Cyrus king of Persia.

# Ezra 3:8
Now in the second month of the second year
of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem,
Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
Jeshua the son of Jozadak,
and the rest of their brethren the priests and the Levites,
and all those who had come out of the captivity to Jerusalem,
began work and appointed the Levites from 20 years old and above
to oversee the work of the house of the Lord.

# Ezra 3:9
Then Jeshua with his sons and brothers,
Kadmiel with his sons,
and the sons of Judah,
arose as one to oversee those working on the house of God:
the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brethren the Levites.

# Ezra 3:10
When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the Lord,
the priests stood in their apparel with trumpets,
and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals,
to praise the Lord,
according to the ordinance of David king of Israel.

# Ezra 3:11
And they sang responsively,
praising and giving thanks to the Lord:
{
  For He is good,
  For His mercy endures forever toward Israel.
}

Then all the people shouted with a great shout,
when they praised the Lord,
because the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid.

# Ezra 3:12
But many of the priests and Levites
and heads of the fathers' houses,
old men who had seen the first temple,
wept with a loud voice
when the foundation of this temple was laid before their eyes.

Yet many shouted aloud for joy,
# Ezra 3:13
so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy
from the noise of the weeping of the people,
for the people shouted with a loud shout,
and the sound was heard afar off.

# Ezra 4:1
Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin
heard that the descendants of the captivity
were building the temple of the Lord God of Israel,
# Ezra 4:2
they came to Zerubbabel and the heads of the fathers' houses,
and said to them,
{
  Let us build with you,
  for we seek your God as you do;
  and we have sacrificed to Him
  since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria,
  who brought us here.
}

# Ezra 4:3
But Zerubbabel and Jeshua
and the rest of the heads of the fathers' houses of Israel
said to them,
{
  You may do nothing with us to build a house for our God;
  but we alone will build to the Lord God of Israel,
  as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.
}

# Ezra 4:4
Then the people of the land tried to discourage the people of Judah.

They troubled them in building,
# Ezra 4:5
and hired counselors against them
to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia,
even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.

# Ezra 4:6
In the reign of Ahasuerus,
in the beginning of his reign,
they wrote an accusation
against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

# Ezra 4:7
In the days of Artaxerxes also,
Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabel,
and the rest of their companions wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia;
and the letter was written in Aramaic script,
and translated into the Aramaic language.

# Ezra 4:8
Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe
wrote a letter against Jerusalem
to King Artaxerxes
in this fashion:

# Ezra 4:9
From Rehum the commander,
Shimshai the scribe,
and the rest of their companions --
representatives of the Dinaites,
the Apharsathchites,
the Tarpelites,
the people of Persia and Erech and Babylon and Shushan,
the Dehavites,
the Elamites,
# Ezra 4:10
and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnapper
took captive and settled in the cities of Samaria
and the remainder beyond the River --
and so forth.

# Ezra 4:11
(This is a copy of the letter that they sent him)
To King Artaxerxes from your servants,
the men of the region beyond the River,
and so forth:

# Ezra 4:12
  Let it be known to the king
  that the Jews who came up from you
  have come to us at Jerusalem,
  and are building the rebellious and evil city,
  and are finishing its walls and repairing the foundations.

# Ezra 4:13
  Let it now be known to the king that,
  if this city is built and the walls completed,
  they will not pay tax, tribute, or custom,
  and the king's treasury will be diminished.

# Ezra 4:14
  Now because we receive support from the palace,
  it was not proper for us to see the king's dishonor;
  therefore we have sent and informed the king,
# Ezra 4:15
  that search may be made
  in the book of the records of your fathers.

  And you will find in the book of the records
  and know that this city is a rebellious city,
  harmful to kings and provinces,
  and that they have incited sedition within the city
  in former times,
  for which cause this city was destroyed.

# Ezra 4:16
  We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt
  and its walls are completed,
  the result will be
  that you will have no dominion beyond the River.

# Ezra 4:17
The king sent an answer:
  To Rehum the commander,
  to Shimshai the scribe,
  to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria,
  and to the remainder beyond the River:
  Peace, and so forth.

# Ezra 4:18
  The letter which you sent to us has been clearly read before me.

# Ezra 4:19
  And I gave the command,
  and a search has been made,
  and it was found that this city in former times
  has revolted against kings,
  and rebellion and sedition have been fostered in it.

# Ezra 4:20
  There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem,
  who have ruled over all the region beyond the River;
  and tax, tribute, and custom were paid to them.

# Ezra 4:21
  Now give the command to make these men cease,
  that this city may not be built until the command is given by me.

# Ezra 4:22
  Take heed now that you do not fail to do this.

# Ezra 4:23
  Why should damage increase to the hurt of the kings?

# Ezra 4:24
Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum,
Shimshai the scribe,
and their companions,
they went up in haste to Jerusalem against the Jews,
and by force of arms made them cease.

# Ezra 4:25
Thus the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased,
and it was discontinued
until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.

# Ezra 5:1
Then the prophet Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophets,
prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem,
in the name of the God of Israel,
who was over them.

# Ezra 5:2
So Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel
and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up
and began to build the house of God which is in Jerusalem;
and the prophets of God were with them,
helping them.

# Ezra 5:3
At the same time Tattenai the governor of the region
beyond the River
and Shethar-Boznai and their companions
came to them and spoke thus to them:
{
  Who has commanded you to build this temple and finish this wall?
}

# Ezra 5:4
Then, accordingly,
we told them the names of the men
who were constructing this building.

# Ezra 5:5
But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews,
so that they could not make them cease
till a report could go to Darius.

Then a written answer was returned concerning this matter.

# Ezra 5:6
This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai sent:
  The governor of the region beyond the River,
  and Shethar-Boznai,
  and his companions,
  the Persians who were in the region beyond the River,
  to Darius the king.

# Ezra 5:7
(They sent a letter to him, in which was written thus)
  To Darius the king:

  All peace.

# Ezra 5:8
  Let it be known to the king
  that we went into the province of Judea,
  to the temple of the great God,
  which is being built with heavy stones,
  and timber is being laid in the walls;
  and this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands.

# Ezra 5:9
  Then we asked those elders,
  and spoke thus to them:
  {
    Who commanded you to build this temple
    and to finish these walls?
  }

# Ezra 5:10
  We also asked them their names to inform you,
  that we might write the names of the men
  who were chief among them.

# Ezra 5:11
And thus they returned us an answer, saying:
{
  We are the servants
  of the God of heaven and earth,
  and we are rebuilding the temple
  that was built many years ago,
  which a great king of Israel
  built and completed.

# Ezra 5:12
  But because our fathers
  provoked the God of heaven to wrath,
  He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar
  king of Babylon,
  the Chaldean,
  who destroyed this temple
  and carried the people away to Babylon.

# Ezra 5:13
  However,
  in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon,
  King Cyrus issued a decree
  to build this house of God.

# Ezra 5:14
  Also,
  the gold and silver articles
  of the house of God,
  which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple
  that was in Jerusalem
  and carried into the temple of Babylon --
  those King Cyrus took from the temple of Babylon,
  and they were given to one named Sheshbazzar,
  whom he had made governor.

# Ezra 5:15
  And he said to him,
  {
    Take these articles;
    go, carry them to the temple site that is in Jerusalem,
    and let the house of God be rebuilt on its former site.
  }

# Ezra 5:16
  Then the same Sheshbazzar came
  and laid the foundation of the house of God
  which is in Jerusalem;
  but from that time even until now it has been under construction,
  and it is not finished.
}

# Ezra 5:17
Now therefore, if it seems good to the king,
let a search be made in the king's treasure house,
which is there in Babylon,
whether it is so that a decree was issued by King Cyrus
to build this house of God at Jerusalem,
and let the king send us his pleasure concerning this matter.

# Ezra 6:1
Then King Darius issued a decree,
and a search was made in the archives,
where the treasures were stored in Babylon.

# Ezra 6:2
And at Achmetha,
in the palace that is in the province of Media,
a scroll was found,
and in it a record was written thus:

# Ezra 6:3
In the first year of King Cyrus,
King Cyrus issued a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem:
{
  Let the house be rebuilt,
  the place where they offered sacrifices;
  and let the foundations of it be firmly laid,
  its height 60 cubits and its width 60 cubits,
# Ezra 6:4
  with three rows of heavy stones and one row of new timber.

  Let the expenses be paid from the king's treasury.

# Ezra 6:5
  Also let the gold and silver articles of the house of God,
  which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple which is in Jerusalem
  and brought to Babylon,
  be restored and taken back to the temple which is in Jerusalem,
  each to its place;
  and deposit them in the house of God
}--

# Ezra 6:6
Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River,
and Shethar-Boznai,
and your companions the Persians who are beyond the River,
keep yourselves far from there.

# Ezra 6:7
Let the work of this house of God alone;
let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews
build this house of God on its site.

# Ezra 6:8
Moreover I issue a decree as to what you shall do
for the elders of these Jews,
for the building of this house of God:

Let the cost be paid at the king's expense
from taxes on the region beyond the River;
this is to be given immediately to these men,
so that they are not hindered.

# Ezra 6:9
And whatever they need --
young bulls, rams, and lambs
for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven,
wheat, salt, wine, and oil,
according to the request of the priests who are in Jerusalem --
let it be given them day by day without fail,
# Ezra 6:10
that they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma to the God of heaven,
and pray for the life of the king and his sons.

# Ezra 6:11
Also I issue a decree that whoever alters this edict,
let a timber be pulled from his house and erected,
and let him be hanged on it;
and let his house be made a refuse heap because of this.

# Ezra 6:12
And may the God who causes His name to dwell there
destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it,
or to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem.

I Darius issue a decree;
let it be done diligently.

# Ezra 6:13
Then Tattenai,
governor of the region beyond the River,
Shethar-Boznai,
and their companions diligently
did according to what King Darius had sent.

# Ezra 6:14
So the elders of the Jews built,
and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet
and Zechariah the son of Iddo.

And they built and finished it,
according to the commandment of the God of Israel,
and according to the command of Cyrus,
Darius,
and Artaxerxes king of Persia.

# Ezra 6:15
Now the temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar,
which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.

# Ezra 6:16
Then the children of Israel,
the priests and the Levites
and the rest of the descendants of the captivity,
celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.

# Ezra 6:17
And they offered sacrifices at the dedication of this house of God,
100 bulls,
200 rams,
400 lambs,
and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats,
according to the number of the tribes of Israel.

# Ezra 6:18
They assigned the priests to their divisions
and the Levites to their divisions,
over the service of God in Jerusalem,
as it is written in the Book of Moses.

# Ezra 6:19
And the descendants of the captivity kept the Passover
on the fourteenth day of the first month.

# Ezra 6:20
For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves;
all of them were ritually clean.

And they slaughtered the Passover lambs
for all the descendants of the captivity,
for their brethren the priests,
and for themselves.

# Ezra 6:21
Then the children of Israel who had returned from the captivity
ate together with all who had separated themselves
from the filth of the nations of the land
in order to seek the Lord God of Israel.

# Ezra 6:22
And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy;
for the Lord made them joyful,
and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them,
to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God,
the God of Israel.

# Ezra 7:1
Now after these things,
in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia,
Ezra the son of Seraiah,
the son of Azariah,
the son of Hilkiah,
# Ezra 7:2
the son of Shallum,
the son of Zadok,
the son of Ahitub,
# Ezra 7:3
the son of Amariah,
the son of Azariah,
the son of Meraioth,
# Ezra 7:4
the son of Zerahiah,
the son of Uzzi,
the son of Bukki,
# Ezra 7:5
the son of Abishua,
the son of Phinehas,
the son of Eleazar,
the son of Aaron the chief priest --
# Ezra 7:6
this Ezra came up from Babylon;
and he was a skilled scribe in the Law of Moses,
which the Lord God of Israel had given.

The king granted him all his request,
according to the hand of the Lord his God upon him.

# Ezra 7:7
Some of the children of Israel,
the priests,
the Levites,
the singers,
the gatekeepers,
and the Nethinim
came up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.

# Ezra 7:8
And Ezra came to Jerusalem in the fifth month,
which was in the seventh year of the king.

# Ezra 7:9
On the first day of the first month
he began his journey from Babylon,
and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem,
according to the good hand of his God upon him.

# Ezra 7:10
For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the Law of the Lord,
and to do it,
and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.

# Ezra 7:11
This is a copy of the letter
that King Artaxerxes gave Ezra the priest, the scribe,
expert in the words of the commandments of the Lord,
and of His statutes to Israel:

# Ezra 7:12
  Artaxerxes, king of kings,
  To Ezra the priest,
  a scribe of the Law of the God of heaven:
  Perfect peace,
  and so forth.

# Ezra 7:13
  I issue a decree that all those of the people of Israel
  and the priests and Levites in my realm,
  who volunteer to go up to Jerusalem,
  may go with you.

# Ezra 7:14
  And whereas you are being sent
  by the king and his seven counselors
  to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
  with regard to the Law of your God which is in your hand;
# Ezra 7:15
  and whereas you are to carry the silver and gold
  which the king and his counselors have freely offered
  to the God of Israel,
  whose dwelling is in Jerusalem;
# Ezra 7:16
  and whereas all the silver and gold
  that you may find in all the province of Babylon,
  along with the freewill offering of the people and the priests,
  are to be freely offered
  for the house of their God in Jerusalem --
# Ezra 7:17
  now therefore, be careful to buy with this money
  bulls, rams, and lambs,
  with their grain offerings and their drink offerings,
  and offer them on the altar of the house of your God in Jerusalem.

# Ezra 7:18
  And whatever seems good to you and your brethren
  to do with the rest of the silver and the gold,
  do it according to the will of your God.

# Ezra 7:19
  Also the articles that are given to you
  for the service of the house of your God,
  deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem.

# Ezra 7:20
  And whatever more may be needed for the house of your God,
  which you may have occasion to provide,
  pay for it from the king's treasury.

# Ezra 7:21
  And I, even I, Artaxerxes the king,
  issue a decree to all the treasurers
  who are in the region beyond the River,
  that whatever Ezra the priest,
  the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven,
  may require of you,
  let it be done diligently,
# Ezra 7:22
  up to 100 talents of silver,
  100 kors of wheat,
  100 baths of wine,
  100 baths of oil,
  and salt without prescribed limit.

# Ezra 7:23
  Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven,
  let it diligently be done for the house of the God of heaven.

  For why should there be wrath
  against the realm of the king and his sons?

# Ezra 7:24
  Also we inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tax,
  tribute,
  or custom on any of the priests,
  Levites,
  singers,
  gatekeepers,
  Nethinim,
  or servants of this house of God.

# Ezra 7:25
  And you, Ezra, according to your God-given wisdom,
  set magistrates and judges who may judge all the people
  who are in the region beyond the River,
  all such as know the laws of your God;
  and teach those who do not know them.

# Ezra 7:26
  Whoever will not observe the law of your God
  and the law of the king,
  let judgment be executed speedily on him,
  whether it be death,
  or banishment,
  or confiscation of goods,
  or imprisonment.

# Ezra 7:27
Blessed be the Lord God of our fathers,
who has put such a thing as this in the king's heart,
to beautify the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem,
# Ezra 7:28
and has extended mercy to me before the king and his counselors,
and before all the king's mighty princes.

So I was encouraged,
as the hand of the Lord my God was upon me;
and I gathered leading men of Israel to go up with me.

# Ezra 8:1
These are the heads of their fathers' houses,
and this is the genealogy of those who went up with me from Babylon,
in the reign of King Artaxerxes:
# Ezra 8:2
of the sons of Phinehas,    Gershom;
of the sons of Ithamar,     Daniel;
of the sons of David,       Hattush;
# Ezra 8:3
of the sons of Shecaniah,
of the sons of Parosh,      Zechariah;
and registered with him were 150 males;
# Ezra 8:4
of the sons of Pahath-Moab, Eliehoenai the son of Zerahiah,
and with him 200 males;
# Ezra 8:5
of the sons of Shechaniah,  Ben-Jahaziel,
and with him 300 males;
# Ezra 8:6
of the sons of Adin,        Ebed the son of Jonathan,
and with him 50 males;
# Ezra 8:7
of the sons of Elam,        Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah,
and with him 70 males;
# Ezra 8:8
of the sons of Shephatiah,  Zebadiah the son of Michael,
and with him 80 males;
# Ezra 8:9
of the sons of Joab,        Obadiah the son of Jehiel,
and with him 218 males;
# Ezra 8:10
of the sons of Shelomith,   Ben-Josiphiah,
and with him 160 males;
# Ezra 8:11
of the sons of Bebai,       Zechariah the son of Bebai,
and with him 28 males;
# Ezra 8:12
of the sons of Azgad,       Johanan the son of Hakkatan,
and with him 110 males;
# Ezra 8:13
of the last sons of Adonikam,
whose names are these --    Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah --
and with them 60 males;
# Ezra 8:14
also of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud,
and with them 70 males.

# Ezra 8:15
Now I gathered them by the river that flows to Ahava,
and we camped there three days.

And I looked among the people and the priests,
and found none of the sons of Levi there.

# Ezra 8:16
Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan,
Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, leaders;
also for Joiarib and Elnathan,
men of understanding.

# Ezra 8:17
And I gave them a command for Iddo
the chief man at the place Casiphia,
and I told them what they should say to Iddo and his brethren
the Nethinim at the place Casiphia --
that they should bring us servants for the house of our God.

# Ezra 8:18
Then, by the good hand of our God upon us,
they brought us a man of understanding,
of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, the son of Israel,
namely Sherebiah,
with his sons and brothers, 18 men;
# Ezra 8:19
and Hashabiah,
and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,
his brothers and their sons, 20 men;
# Ezra 8:20
also of the Nethinim,
whom David and the leaders had appointed
for the service of the Levites, 220 Nethinim.

All of them were designated by name.

# Ezra 8:21
Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava,
that we might humble ourselves before our God,
to seek from Him the right way for us
and our little ones
and all our possessions.

# Ezra 8:22
For I was ashamed to request of the king
an escort of soldiers and horsemen
to help us against the enemy on the road,
because we had spoken to the king, saying,
{
  The hand of our God is upon all those for good who seek Him,
  but His power and His wrath are against all those who forsake Him.
}

# Ezra 8:23
So we fasted and entreated our God for this,
and He answered our prayer.

# Ezra 8:24
And I separated 12 of the leaders of the priests --
Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and 10 of their brethren with them --
# Ezra 8:25
and weighed out to them the silver,
the gold,
and the articles,
the offering for the house of our God
which the king and his counselors and his princes,
and all Israel who were present,
had offered.

# Ezra 8:26
I weighed into their hand 650 talents of silver,
silver articles weighing 100 talents,
100 talents of gold,
# Ezra 8:27
20 gold basins worth 1000 drachmas,
and two vessels of fine polished bronze,
precious as gold.

# Ezra 8:28
And I said to them,
{
  You are holy to the Lord;
  the articles are holy also;
  and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering
  to the Lord God of your fathers.

# Ezra 8:29
  Watch and keep them until you weigh them
  before the leaders of the priests and the Levites
  and heads of the fathers' houses of Israel in Jerusalem,
  in the chambers of the house of the Lord.
}

# Ezra 8:30
So the priests and the Levites received the silver
and the gold
and the articles
by weight,
to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.

# Ezra 8:31
Then we departed from the river of Ahava
on the twelfth day of the first month,
to go to Jerusalem.

And the hand of our God was upon us,
and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy
and from ambush along the road.

# Ezra 8:32
So we came to Jerusalem,
and stayed there three days.

# Ezra 8:33
Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the articles
were weighed in the house of our God
by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest,
and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas;
with them were the Levites,
Jozabad the son of Jeshua and Noadiah the son of Binnui,
# Ezra 8:34
with the number and weight of everything.

All the weight was written down at that time.

# Ezra 8:35
The children of those who had been carried away captive,
who had come from the captivity,
offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel:
12 bulls for all Israel,
96 rams,
77 lambs,
and 12 male goats as a sin offering.

All this was a burnt offering to the Lord.

# Ezra 8:36
And they delivered the king's orders
to the king's satraps and the governors
in the region beyond the River.

So they gave support to the people and the house of God.

# Ezra 9:1
When these things were done,
the leaders came to me, saying,
{
  The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites
  have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands,
  with respect to the abominations of the Canaanites,
  the Hittites,
  the Perizzites,
  the Jebusites,
  the Ammonites,
  the Moabites,
  the Egyptians,
  and the Amorites.

# Ezra 9:2
  For they have taken some of their daughters
  as wives for themselves
  and their sons,
  so that the holy seed is mixed with the peoples of those lands.

  Indeed, the hand of the leaders and rulers
  has been foremost in this trespass.
}

# Ezra 9:3
So when I heard this thing,
I tore my garment and my robe,
and plucked out some of the hair of my head and beard,
and sat down astonished.

# Ezra 9:4
Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel
assembled to me,
because of the transgression
of those who had been carried away captive,
and I sat astonished until the evening sacrifice.

# Ezra 9:5
At the evening sacrifice I arose from my fasting;
and having torn my garment and my robe,
I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the Lord my God.

# Ezra 9:6
And I said:
{
  O my God,
  I am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to You, my God;
  for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads,
  and our guilt has grown up to the heavens.

# Ezra 9:7
  Since the days of our fathers
  to this day we have been very guilty,
  and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests
  have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands,
  to the sword,
  to captivity,
  to plunder,
  and to humiliation,
  as it is this day.

# Ezra 9:8
  And now for a little while grace has been shown
  from the Lord our God,
  to leave us a remnant to escape,
  and to give us a peg in His holy place,
  that our God may enlighten our eyes
  and give us a measure of revival in our bondage.

# Ezra 9:9
  For we were slaves.

  Yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage;
  but He extended mercy to us in the sight of the kings of Persia,
  to revive us,
  to repair the house of our God,
  to rebuild its ruins,
  and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.

# Ezra 9:10
  And now, O our God, what shall we say after this?

  For we have forsaken Your commandments,
# Ezra 9:11
  which You commanded by Your servants the prophets,
  saying,
  {
    The land which you are entering to possess is an unclean land,
    with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands,
    with their abominations which have filled it
    from one end to another with their impurity.

# Ezra 9:12
    Now therefore,
    do not give your daughters as wives for their sons,
    nor take their daughters to your sons;
    and never seek their peace or prosperity,
    that you may be strong and eat the good of the land,
    and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever.
  }

# Ezra 9:13
  And after all that has come upon us
  for our evil deeds and for our great guilt,
  since You our God have punished us
  less than our iniquities deserve,
  and have given us such deliverance as this,
# Ezra 9:14
  should we again break Your commandments,
  and join in marriage
  with the people committing these abominations?

  Would You not be angry with us until You had consumed us,
  so that there would be no remnant or survivor?

# Ezra 9:15
  O Lord God of Israel,
  You are righteous,
  for we are left as a remnant,
  as it is this day.

  Here we are before You, in our guilt,
  though no one can stand before You because of this!
}

# Ezra 10:1
Now while Ezra was praying,
and while he was confessing, weeping, and bowing down
before the house of God,
a very large assembly of men, women, and children
gathered to him from Israel;
for the people wept very bitterly.

# Ezra 10:2
And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel,
one of the sons of Elam,
spoke up and said to Ezra,
{
  We have trespassed against our God,
  and have taken pagan wives from the peoples of the land;
  yet now there is hope in Israel in spite of this.

# Ezra 10:3
  Now therefore, let us make a covenant with our God
  to put away all these wives and those who have been born to them,
  according to the advice of my master
  and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God;
  and let it be done according to the law.

# Ezra 10:4
  Arise, for this matter is your responsibility.

  We also are with you.

  Be of good courage, and do it.
}

# Ezra 10:5
Then Ezra arose,
and made the leaders of the priests,
the Levites,
and all Israel swear an oath
that they would do according to this word.

So they swore an oath.

# Ezra 10:6
Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God,
and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib;
and when he came there,
he ate no bread and drank no water,
for he mourned
because of the guilt of those from the captivity.

# Ezra 10:7
And they issued a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem
to all the descendants of the captivity,
that they must gather at Jerusalem,
# Ezra 10:8
and that whoever would not come within three days,
according to the instructions of the leaders and elders,
all his property would be confiscated,
and he himself would be separated
from the assembly of those from the captivity.

# Ezra 10:9
So all the men of Judah and Benjamin
gathered at Jerusalem
within three days.

It was the ninth month,
on the twentieth of the month;
and all the people sat in the open square of the house of God,
trembling because of this matter and because of heavy rain.

# Ezra 10:10
Then Ezra the priest stood up and said to them,
{
  You have transgressed and have taken pagan wives,
  adding to the guilt of Israel.

# Ezra 10:11
  Now therefore,
  make confession to the Lord God of your fathers,
  and do His will;
  separate yourselves from the peoples of the land,
  and from the pagan wives.
}

# Ezra 10:12
Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice,
{
  Yes!

  As you have said, so we must do.

# Ezra 10:13
  But there are many people;
  it is the season for heavy rain,
  and we are not able to stand outside.

  Nor is this the work of one or two days,
  for there are many of us who have transgressed in this matter.

# Ezra 10:14
  Please, let the leaders of our entire assembly stand;
  and let all those in our cities who have taken pagan wives
  come at appointed times,
  together with the elders and judges of their cities,
  until the fierce wrath of our God
  is turned away from us in this matter.
}

# Ezra 10:15
Only Jonathan the son of Asahel
and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah opposed this,
and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite gave them support.

# Ezra 10:16
Then the descendants of the captivity did so.

And Ezra the priest,
with certain heads of the fathers' households,
were set apart by the fathers' households,
each of them by name;
and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month
to examine the matter.

# Ezra 10:17
By the first day of the first month
they finished questioning all the men who had taken pagan wives.

# Ezra 10:18
And among the sons of the priests who had taken pagan wives
the following were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak,
and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.

# Ezra 10:19
And they gave their promise that they would put away their wives;
and being guilty,
they presented a ram of the flock as their trespass offering.

# Ezra 10:20
Also of the sons of Immer:
Hanani and Zebadiah;
# Ezra 10:21
of the sons of Harim:
Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah;
# Ezra 10:22
of the sons of Pashhur:
Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

# Ezra 10:23
Also of the Levites:
Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (the same is Kelita),
Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

# Ezra 10:24
Also of the singers:
Eliashib;

and of the gatekeepers:
Shallum, Telem, and Uri.

# Ezra 10:25
And others of Israel:
of the sons of Parosh:
Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah;
# Ezra 10:26
of the sons of Elam:
Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Eliah;
# Ezra 10:27
of the sons of Zattu:
Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza;
# Ezra 10:28
of the sons of Bebai:
Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai;
# Ezra 10:29
of the sons of Bani:
Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth;
# Ezra 10:30
of the sons of Pahath-Moab:
Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui,
and Manasseh;
# Ezra 10:31
of the sons of Harim:
Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;
# Ezra 10:32
of the sons of Hashum:
Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh,
and Shimei;
# Ezra 10:33
of the sons of Bani:
Maadai, Amram, Uel,
# Ezra 10:34
Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluh,
# Ezra 10:35
Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
# Ezra 10:36
Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasai,
# Ezra 10:37
Bani, Binnui, Shimei,
# Ezra 10:38
Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,
# Ezra 10:39
Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
# Ezra 10:40
Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
# Ezra 10:41
Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;
# Ezra 10:42
of the sons of Nebo:
Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.

# Ezra 10:43
All these had taken pagan wives,
and some of them had wives by whom they had children.
