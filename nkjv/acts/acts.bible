# Acts 1:1
The former account I made, O Theophilus,
of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,
# Acts 1:2
until the day in which He was taken up,
after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments
to the apostles whom He had chosen,
# Acts 1:3
to whom He also presented Himself alive
after His suffering
by many infallible proofs,
being seen by them during forty days
and speaking of the things
pertaining to the kingdom of God.

# Acts 1:4
And being assembled together with them,
He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem,
but to wait for the Promise of the Father,
{
  which,
}
He said,
{
  you have heard from Me;
# Acts 1:5
  for John truly baptized with water,
  but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit
  not many days from now.
}

# Acts 1:6
Therefore,
when they had come together,
they asked Him, saying,
{
  Lord, will You at this time
  restore the kingdom to Israel?
}

# Acts 1:7
And He said to them,
{
  It is not for you to know times or seasons
  which the Father has put in His own authority.

# Acts 1:8
  But you shall receive power
  when the Holy Spirit has come upon you;
  and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem,
  and in all Judea and Samaria,
  and to the end of the earth.
}

# Acts 1:9
Now when He had spoken these things,
while they watched, He was taken up,
and a cloud received Him out of their sight.

# Acts 1:10
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven
as He went up,
behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,
# Acts 1:11
who also said,
{
  Men of Galilee,
  why do you stand gazing up into heaven?

  This same Jesus,
  who was taken up from you into heaven,
  will so come in like manner
  as you saw Him go into heaven.
}

# Acts 1:12
Then they returned to Jerusalem
from the mount called Olivet,
which is near Jerusalem,
a Sabbath day's journey.

# Acts 1:13
And when they had entered,
they went up into the upper room
where they were staying:
Peter, James, John, and Andrew;
Philip and Thomas;
Bartholomew and Matthew;
James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot;
and Judas the son of James.

# Acts 1:14
These all continued with one accord
in prayer and supplication,
with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus,
and with His brothers.

# Acts 1:15
And in those days
Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(altogether the number of names was about 120),
and said,
{
# Acts 1:16
  Men and brethren,
  this Scripture had to be fulfilled,
  which the Holy Spirit spoke before
  by the mouth of David concerning Judas,
  who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus;
# Acts 1:17
  for he was numbered with us
  and obtained a part in this ministry.
}

# Acts 1:18
(Now this man purchased a field
with the wages of iniquity;
and falling headlong,
he burst open in the middle
and all his entrails gushed out.

# Acts 1:19
And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem;
so that field is called in their own language,
Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)

{
# Acts 1:20
  For it is written in the book of Psalms:
  {
    Let his dwelling place be desolate,
    And let no one live in it
  };
  and,
  {
    Let another take his office.
  }

# Acts 1:21
  Therefore,
  of these men who have accompanied us
  all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
# Acts 1:22
  beginning from the baptism of John
  to that day when He was taken up from us,
  one of these must become a witness with us
  of His resurrection.
}

# Acts 1:23
And they proposed two:
Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus,
and Matthias.

# Acts 1:24
And they prayed and said,
{
  You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all,
  show which of these two You have chosen
# Acts 1:25
  to take part in this ministry and apostleship
  from which Judas by transgression fell,
  that he might go to his own place.
}

# Acts 1:26
And they cast their lots,
and the lot fell on Matthias.

And he was numbered with the eleven apostles.

# Acts 2:1
When the Day of Pentecost had fully come,
they were all with one accord in one place.

# Acts 2:2
And suddenly there came a sound from heaven,
as of a rushing mighty wind,
and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.

# Acts 2:3
Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire,
and one sat upon each of them.

# Acts 2:4
And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit
and began to speak with other tongues,
as the Spirit gave them utterance.

# Acts 2:5
And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men,
from every nation under heaven.

# Acts 2:6
And when this sound occurred,
the multitude came together, and were confused,
because everyone heard them speak in his own language.

# Acts 2:7
Then they were all amazed and marveled,
saying to one another,
{
  Look, are not all these who speak Galileans?

# Acts 2:8
  And how is it that we hear
  each in our own language in which we were born?

# Acts 2:9
  Parthians and Medes and Elamites
  those dwelling in Mesopotamia,
  Judea and Cappadocia,
  Pontus and Asia,
# Acts 2:10
  Phrygia and Pamphylia,
  Egypt and the parts of Libya adjoining Cyrene,
  visitors from Rome,
  both Jews and proselytes,
# Acts 2:11
  Cretans and Arabs --
  we hear them speaking in our own tongues
  the wonderful works of God.
}

# Acts 2:12
So they were all amazed and perplexed,
saying to one another,
{
  Whatever could this mean?
}

# Acts 2:13
Others mocking said,
{
  They are full of new wine.
}

# Acts 2:14
But Peter, standing up with the eleven,
raised his voice and said to them,
{
  Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem,
  let this be known to you, and heed my words.

# Acts 2:15
  For these are not drunk, as you suppose.
  since it is only the third hour of the day.

# Acts 2:16
  But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
  {
# Acts 2:17
    And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God,
    That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh;
    Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
    Your young men shall see visions,
    Your old men shall dream dreams.

# Acts 2:18
    And on My menservants and on My maidservants
    I will pour out My Spirit in those days;
    And they shall prophesy.

# Acts 2:19
    I will show wonders in heaven above
    And signs in the earth beneath:
    Blood and fire and vapor of smoke.

# Acts 2:20
    The sun shall be turned into darkness,
    And the moon into blood,
    Before the coming
    of the great and awesome day of the Lord.

# Acts 2:21
    And it shall come to pass
    That whoever calls on the name of the Lord
    Shall be saved.
  }

# Acts 2:22
  Men of Israel, hear these words:
  Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you
  by miracles, wonders, and signs
  which God did through Him in your midst,
  as you yourselves also know --
# Acts 2:23
  Him, being delivered
  by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God,
  you have taken by lawless hands,
  have crucified,
  and put to death;
# Acts 2:24
  whom God raised up,
  having loosed the pains of death,
  because it was not possible that He should be held by it.

# Acts 2:25
  For David says concerning Him:
  {
    I foresaw the Lord always before my face,
    For He is at my right hand,
    that I may not be shaken.

# Acts 2:26
    Therefore my heart rejoiced,
    and my tongue was glad;
    Moreover my flesh also will rest in hope.

# Acts 2:27
    For You will not leave my soul in Hades,
    Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.

# Acts 2:28
    You have made known to me the ways of life;
    You will make me full of joy in Your presence.
  }

# Acts 2:29
  Men and brethren,
  let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David,
  that he is both dead and buried,
  and his tomb is with us to this day.

# Acts 2:30
  Therefore, being a prophet,
  and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him
  that of the fruit of his body,
  according to the flesh,
  He would raise up the Christ
  to sit on his throne,
# Acts 2:31
  he, foreseeing this,
  spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ,
  that His soul was not left in Hades,
  nor did His flesh see corruption.

# Acts 2:32
  This Jesus God has raised up,
  of which we are all witnesses.

# Acts 2:33
  Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God,
  and having received from the Father
  the promise of the Holy Spirit,
  He poured out this which you now see and hear.

# Acts 2:34
  For David did not ascend into the heavens,
  but he says himself:
  {
    The Lord said to my Lord,
    {
      Sit at My right hand,
# Acts 2:35
      Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.
    }
  }

# Acts 2:36
  Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly
  that God has made this Jesus,
  whom you crucified,
  both Lord and Christ.
}

# Acts 2:37
Now when they heard this,
they were cut to the heart,
and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles,
{
  Men and brethren, what shall we do?
}

# Acts 2:38
Then Peter said to them,
{
  Repent,
  and let every one of you be baptized
  in the name of Jesus Christ
  for the remission of sins;
  and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

# Acts 2:39
  For the promise is to you and to your children,
  and to all who are afar off,
  as many as the Lord our God will call.
}

# Acts 2:40
And with many other words he testified and exhorted them,
saying,
{
  Be saved from this perverse generation.
}

# Acts 2:41
Then those who gladly received his word were baptized;
and that day about 3000 souls were added to them.

# Acts 2:42
And they continued steadfastly
in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship,
in the breaking of bread,
and in prayers.

# Acts 2:43
Then fear came upon every soul,
and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.

# Acts 2:44
Now all who believed were together,
and had all things in common,
# Acts 2:45
and sold their possessions and goods,
and divided them among all,
as anyone had need.

# Acts 2:46
So continuing daily with one accord in the temple,
and breaking bread from house to house,
they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,
# Acts 2:47
praising God and having favor with all the people.

And the Lord added to the church daily
those who were being saved.

# Acts 3:1
Now Peter and John went up together to the temple
at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.

# Acts 3:2
And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried,
whom they laid daily
at the gate
of the temple
which is called Beautiful,
to ask alms from those who entered the temple;
# Acts 3:3
who, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple,
asked for alms.

# Acts 3:4
And fixing his eyes on him, with John, Peter said,
{
  Look at us.
}

# Acts 3:5
So he gave them his attention,
expecting to receive something from them.

# Acts 3:6
Then Peter said,
{
  Silver and gold I do not have,
  but what I do have I give you:

  In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.
}

# Acts 3:7
And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up,
and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.

# Acts 3:8
So he, leaping up,
stood and walked and entered the temple with them --
walking, leaping, and praising God.

# Acts 3:9
And all the people saw him walking and praising God.

# Acts 3:10
Then they knew that it was he who sat begging alms
at the Beautiful Gate of the temple;
and they were filled with wonder and amazement
at what had happened to him.

# Acts 3:11
Now as the lame man who was healed held on to Peter and John,
all the people ran together to them
in the porch which is called Solomon's,
greatly amazed.

# Acts 3:12
So when Peter saw it, he responded to the people:
{
  Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this?

  Or why look so intently at us,
  as though by our own power or godliness
  we had made this man walk?

# Acts 3:13
  The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
  the God of our fathers,
  glorified His Servant Jesus,
  whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate,
  when he was determined to let Him go.

# Acts 3:14
  But you denied the Holy One and the Just,
  and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
# Acts 3:15
  and killed the Prince of life,
  whom God raised from the dead,
  of which we are witnesses.

# Acts 3:16
  And His name, through faith in His name,
  has made this man strong,
  whom you see and know.

  Yes, the faith which comes through Him
  has given him this perfect soundness
  in the presence of you all.

# Acts 3:17
  Yet now, brethren, I know that you did it in ignorance,
  as did also your rulers.

# Acts 3:18
  But those things which God foretold
  by the mouth of all His prophets,
  that the Christ would suffer,
  He has thus fulfilled.

# Acts 3:19
  Repent therefore and be converted,
  that your sins may be blotted out,
  so that times of refreshing may come
  from the presence of the Lord,
# Acts 3:20
  and that He may send Jesus Christ,
  who was preached to you before,
# Acts 3:21
  whom heaven must receive until
  the times of restoration of all things,
  which God has spoken
  by the mouth of all His holy prophets
  since the world began.

# Acts 3:22
  For Moses truly said to the fathers,
  {
    The Lord your God will raise up for you
    a Prophet like me from your brethren.

    Him you shall hear in all things,
    whatever He says to you.

# Acts 3:23
    And it shall be that every soul
    who will not hear that Prophet
    shall be utterly destroyed
    from among the people.
  }

# Acts 3:24
  Yes, and all the prophets,
  from Samuel and those who follow,
  as many as have spoken,
  have also foretold these days.

# Acts 3:25
  You are sons of the prophets,
  and of the covenant
  which God made with our fathers,
  saying to Abraham,
  {
    And in your seed
    all the families of the earth
    shall be blessed.
  }

# Acts 3:26
  To you first, God,
  having raised up His Servant Jesus,
  sent Him to bless you,
  in turning away every one of you
  from your iniquities.
}

# Acts 4:1
Now as they spoke to the people,
the priests,
the captain of the temple,
and the Sadducees came upon them,
# Acts 4:2
being greatly disturbed that they taught the people
and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.

# Acts 4:3
And they laid hands on them,
and put them in custody until the next day,
for it was already evening.

# Acts 4:4
However, many of those who heard the word believed;
and the number of the men came to be about 5000.

# Acts 4:5
And it came to pass, on the next day,
that their rulers, elders, and scribes,
# Acts 4:6
as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander,
and as many as were of the family of the high priest,
were gathered together at Jerusalem.

# Acts 4:7
And when they had set them in the midst, they asked,
{
  By what power or by what name have you done this?
}

# Acts 4:8
Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them,
{
  Rulers of the people and elders of Israel:

# Acts 4:9
  If we this day are judged for a good deed
  done to a helpless man,
  by what means he has been made well,
# Acts 4:10
  let it be known to you all,
  and to all the people of Israel,
  that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
  whom you crucified,
  whom God raised from the dead,
  by Him this man stands here before you whole.

# Acts 4:11
  This is the
  {
    stone which was rejected by you builders,
    which has become the chief cornerstone.
  }

# Acts 4:12
  Nor is there salvation in any other,
  for there is no other name under heaven given among men
  by which we must be saved.
}

# Acts 4:13
Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John,
and perceived that they were uneducated and untrained men,
they marveled.

And they realized that they had been with Jesus.

# Acts 4:14
And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them,
they could say nothing against it.

# Acts 4:15
But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,
they conferred among themselves,
# Acts 4:16
saying,
{
  What shall we do to these men?

  For, indeed,
  that a notable miracle has been done through them
  is evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem,
  and we cannot deny it.

# Acts 4:17
  But so that it spreads no further among the people,
  let us severely threaten them,
  that from now on they speak to no man in this name.
}

# Acts 4:18
And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all
nor teach in the name of Jesus.

# Acts 4:19
But Peter and John answered and said to them,
{
  Whether it is right in the sight of God
  to listen to you more than to God,
  you judge.

# Acts 4:20
  For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
}

# Acts 4:21
So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,
finding no way of punishing them,
because of the people,
since they all glorified God for what had been done.

# Acts 4:22
For the man was over 40 years old
on whom this miracle of healing had been performed.

# Acts 4:23
And being let go,
they went to their own companions
and reported all
that the chief priests and elders
had said to them.

# Acts 4:24
So when they heard that,
they raised their voice to God with one accord
and said:
{
  Lord, You are God,
  who made heaven and earth and the sea,
  and all that is in them,
# Acts 4:25
  who by the mouth of Your servant David
  have said:
  {
    Why did the nations rage,
    And the people plot vain things?

# Acts 4:26
    The kings of the earth took their stand,
    And the rulers were gathered together
    Against the Lord and against His Christ.
  }

# Acts 4:27
  For truly against Your holy Servant Jesus,
  whom You anointed,
  both Herod and Pontius Pilate,
  with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,
  were gathered together
# Acts 4:28
  to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose
  determined before to be done.

# Acts 4:29
  Now, Lord, look on their threats,
  and grant to Your servants
  that with all boldness
  they may speak Your word,
# Acts 4:30
  by stretching out Your hand to heal,
  and that signs and wonders may be done
  through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus.
}

# Acts 4:31
And when they had prayed,
the place where they were assembled together
was shaken;
and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit,
and they spoke the word of God with boldness.

# Acts 4:32
Now the multitude of those who believed
were of one heart and one soul;
neither did anyone say
that any of the things he possessed was his own,
but they had all things in common.

# Acts 4:33
And with great power the apostles gave witness
to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.

And great grace was upon them all.

# Acts 4:34
Nor was there anyone among them who lacked;
for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them,
and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,
# Acts 4:35
and laid them at the apostles' feet;
and they distributed to each as anyone had need.

# Acts 4:36
And Joses, who was also named Barnabas by the apostles
(which is translated Son of Encouragement),
a Levite of the country of Cyprus,
# Acts 4:37
having land, sold it,
and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.

# Acts 5:1
But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife,
sold a possession.

# Acts 5:2
And he kept back part of the proceeds,
his wife also being aware of it,
and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles' feet.

# Acts 5:3
But Peter said,
{
  Ananias,
  why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit
  and keep back part of the price of the land for yourself?

# Acts 5:4
  While it remained, was it not your own?

  And after it was sold, was it not in your own control?

  Why have you conceived this thing in your heart?

  You have not lied to men but to God.
}

# Acts 5:5
Then Ananias, hearing these words,
fell down and breathed his last.

So great fear came upon all those who heard these things.

# Acts 5:6
And the young men arose and wrapped him up,
carried him out,
and buried him.

# Acts 5:7
Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in,
not knowing what had happened.

# Acts 5:8
And Peter answered her,
{
  Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?
}

She said,
{
  Yes, for so much.
}

# Acts 5:9
Then Peter said to her,
{
  How is it that you have agreed together
  to test the Spirit of the Lord?

  Look,
  the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door,
  and they will carry you out.
}

# Acts 5:10
Then immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last.

And the young men came in and found her dead,
and carrying her out,
buried her by her husband.

# Acts 5:11
So great fear came upon all the church
and upon all who heard these things.

# Acts 5:12
And through the hands of the apostles
many signs and wonders were done among the people.

And they were all with one accord in Solomon's Porch.

# Acts 5:13
Yet none of the rest dared join them,
but the people esteemed them highly.

# Acts 5:14
And believers were increasingly added to the Lord,
multitudes of both men and women,
# Acts 5:15
so that they brought the sick out into the streets
and laid them on beds and couches,
that at least the shadow of Peter passing by
might fall on some of them.

# Acts 5:16
Also a multitude gathered
from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem,
bringing sick people
and those who were tormented by unclean spirits,
and they were all healed.

# Acts 5:17
Then the high priest rose up,
and all those who were with him
(which is the sect of the Sadducees),
and they were filled with indignation,
# Acts 5:18
and laid their hands on the apostles
and put them in the common prison.

# Acts 5:19
But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors
and brought them out, and said,
{
# Acts 5:20
  Go, stand in the temple
  and speak to the people all the words of this life.
}

# Acts 5:21
And when they heard that,
they entered the temple early in the morning and taught.

But the high priest and those with him
came and called the council together,
with all the elders of the children of Israel,
and sent to the prison to have them brought.

# Acts 5:22
But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison,
they returned and reported,
# Acts 5:23
saying,
{
  Indeed we found the prison shut securely,
  and the guards standing outside before the doors;
  but when we opened them,
  we found no one inside!
}

# Acts 5:24
Now when the high priest,
the captain of the temple,
and the chief priests heard these things,
they wondered what the outcome would be.

# Acts 5:25
So one came and told them, saying,
{
  Look, the men whom you put in prison
  are standing in the temple and teaching the people!
}

# Acts 5:26
Then the captain went with the officers
and brought them without violence,
for they feared the people,
lest they should be stoned.

# Acts 5:27
And when they had brought them,
they set them before the council.

And the high priest asked them,
# Acts 5:28
saying,
{
  Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name?

  And look,
  you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine,
  and intend to bring this Man's blood on us!
}

# Acts 5:29
But Peter and the other apostles answered and said:
{
  We ought to obey God rather than men.

# Acts 5:30
  The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered
  by hanging on a tree.

# Acts 5:31
  Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior,
  to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.

# Acts 5:32
  And we are His witnesses to these things,
  and so also is the Holy Spirit
  whom God has given to those who obey Him.
}

# Acts 5:33
When they heard this, they were furious and plotted to kill them.

# Acts 5:34
Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel,
a teacher of the law held in respect by all the people,
and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while.

# Acts 5:35
And he said to them:
{
  Men of Israel,
  take heed to yourselves
  what you intend to do regarding these men.

# Acts 5:36
  For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody.

  A number of men, about 400, joined him.

  He was slain,
  and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing.

# Acts 5:37
  After this man,
  Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census,
  and drew away many people after him.

  He also perished,
  and all who obeyed him were dispersed.

# Acts 5:38
  And now I say to you,
  keep away from these men and let them alone;
  for if this plan or this work is of men,
  it will come to nothing;
# Acts 5:39
  but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it --
  lest you even be found to fight against God.
}

# Acts 5:40
And they agreed with him,
and when they had called for the apostles and beaten them,
they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus,
and let them go.

# Acts 5:41
So they departed from the presence of the council,
rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame
for His name.

# Acts 5:42
And daily in the temple,
and in every house,
they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.

# Acts 6:1
Now in those days,
when the number of the disciples
was multiplying,
there arose a complaint against the Hebrews
by the Hellenists,
because their widows were neglected
in the daily distribution.

# Acts 6:2
Then the twelve summoned
the multitude of the disciples and said,
{
  It is not desirable
  that we should leave the word of God
  and serve tables.

# Acts 6:3
  Therefore, brethren,
  seek out from among you
  seven men of good reputation,
  full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom,
  whom we may appoint over this business;
# Acts 6:4
  but we will give ourselves continually
  to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
}

# Acts 6:5
And the saying pleased the whole multitude.

And they chose Stephen,
a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit,
and Philip,
Prochorus,
Nicanor,
Timon,
Parmenas,
and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch,
# Acts 6:6
whom they set before the apostles;
and when they had prayed,
they laid hands on them.

# Acts 6:7
Then the word of God spread,
and the number of the disciples
multiplied greatly in Jerusalem,
and a great many of the priests
were obedient to the faith.

# Acts 6:8
And Stephen, full of faith and power,
did great wonders and signs among the people.

# Acts 6:9
Then there arose some
from what is called the Synagogue of the Freedmen
(Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia),
disputing with Stephen.

# Acts 6:10
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit
by which he spoke.

# Acts 6:11
Then they secretly induced men to say,
{
  We have heard him speak blasphemous words
  against Moses and God.
}

# Acts 6:12
And they stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes;
and they came upon him, seized him,
and brought him to the council.

# Acts 6:13
They also set up false witnesses who said,
{
  This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words
  against this holy place and the law;
# Acts 6:14
  for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth
  will destroy this place
  and change the customs which Moses delivered to us.
}

# Acts 6:15
And all who sat in the council,
looking steadfastly at him,
saw his face as the face of an angel.

# Acts 7:1
Then the high priest said,
{
  Are these things so?
}

# Acts 7:2
And he said,
{
  Brethren and fathers, listen:
  The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham
  when he was in Mesopotamia,
  before he dwelt in Haran,
# Acts 7:3
  and said to him,
  {
    Get out of your country and from your relatives,
    and come to a land that I will show you.
  }

# Acts 7:4
  Then he came out of the land of the Chaldeans
  and dwelt in Haran.

  And from there, when his father was dead,
  He moved him to this land in which you now dwell.

# Acts 7:5
  And God gave him no inheritance in it,
  not even enough to set his foot on.

  But even when Abraham had no child,
  He promised to give it to him for a possession,
  and to his descendants after him.

# Acts 7:6
  But God spoke in this way:
  that his descendants would dwell in a foreign land,
  and that they would bring them into bondage
  and oppress them 400 years.

  {
# Acts 7:7
    And the nation to whom they will be in bondage I will judge,
  }
  said God,
  {
    and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place.
  }

# Acts 7:8
  Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision;
  and so Abraham begot Isaac
  and circumcised him on the eighth day;
  and Isaac begot Jacob,
  and Jacob begot the 12 patriarchs.

# Acts 7:9
  And the patriarchs, becoming envious,
  sold Joseph into Egypt.

  But God was with him
# Acts 7:10
  and delivered him out of all his troubles,
  and gave him favor and wisdom
  in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt;
  and he made him governor
  over Egypt and all his house.

# Acts 7:11
  Now a famine and great trouble
  came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan,
  and our fathers found no sustenance.

# Acts 7:12
  But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt,
  he sent out our fathers first.

# Acts 7:13
  And the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers,
  and Joseph's family became known to the Pharaoh.

# Acts 7:14
  Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob
  and all his relatives to him,
  75 people.

# Acts 7:15
  So Jacob went down to Egypt;
  and he died, he and our fathers.

# Acts 7:16
  And they were carried back to Shechem
  and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a sum of money
  from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem.

# Acts 7:17
  But when the time of the promise drew near
  which God had sworn to Abraham,
  the people grew and multiplied in Egypt
# Acts 7:18
  till another king arose who did not know Joseph.

# Acts 7:19
  This man dealt treacherously with our people,
  and oppressed our forefathers,
  making them expose their babies,
  so that they might not live.

# Acts 7:20
  At this time Moses was born,
  and was well pleasing to God;
  and he was brought up in his father's house for three months.

# Acts 7:21
  But when he was set out,
  Pharaoh's daughter took him away
  and brought him up as her own son.

# Acts 7:22
  And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,
  and was mighty in words and deeds.

# Acts 7:23
  Now when he was 40 years old,
  it came into his heart to visit his brethren,
  the children of Israel.

# Acts 7:24
  And seeing one of them suffer wrong,
  he defended and avenged him who was oppressed,
  and struck down the Egyptian.

# Acts 7:25
  For he supposed that his brethren would have understood
  that God would deliver them by his hand,
  but they did not understand.

# Acts 7:26
  And the next day
  he appeared to two of them as they were fighting,
  and tried to reconcile them, saying,
  {
    Men, you are brethren;
    why do you wrong one another?
  }

# Acts 7:27
  But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying,
  {
    Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?

# Acts 7:28
    Do you want to kill me as you did the Egyptian yesterday?
  }

# Acts 7:29
  Then, at this saying,
  Moses fled and became a dweller in the land of Midian,
  where he had two sons.

# Acts 7:30
  And when 40 years had passed,
  an Angel of the Lord appeared to him
  in a flame of fire in a bush,
  in the wilderness of Mount Sinai.

# Acts 7:31
  When Moses saw it,
  he marveled at the sight;
  and as he drew near to observe,
  the voice of the Lord came to him,
# Acts 7:32
  saying,
  {
    I am the God of your fathers --
    the God of Abraham,
    the God of Isaac,
    and the God of Jacob.
  }

  And Moses trembled and dared not look.

  {
# Acts 7:33
    Then the Lord said to him,
    {
      Take your sandals off your feet,
      for the place where you stand is holy ground.

# Acts 7:34
      I have surely seen
      the oppression of my people who are in Egypt;
      I have heard
      their groaning and have come down to deliver them.

      And now come, I will send you to Egypt.
    }
  }

# Acts 7:35
  This Moses whom they rejected, saying,
  {
    Who made you a ruler and a judge?
  }
  is the one God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer
  by the hand of the Angel
  who appeared to him in the bush.

# Acts 7:36
  He brought them out,
  after he had shown wonders and signs in the land of Egypt,
  and in the Red Sea,
  and in the wilderness 40 years.

# Acts 7:37
  This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel,
  {
    The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me
    from your brethren.

    Him you shall hear.
  }

# Acts 7:38
  This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness
  with the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai,
  and with our fathers,
  the one who received the living oracles to give to us,
# Acts 7:39
  whom our fathers would not obey,
  but rejected.

  And in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,
# Acts 7:40
  saying to Aaron,
  {
    Make us gods to go before us;
    as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt,
    we do not know what has become of him.
  }

# Acts 7:41
  And they made a calf in those days,
  offered sacrifices to the idol,
  and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.

# Acts 7:42
  Then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven,
  as it is written in the book of the Prophets:
  {
    Did you offer Me slaughtered animals and sacrifices
    during 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?

# Acts 7:43
    You also took up the tabernacle of Moloch,
    And the star of your god Remphan,
    Images which you made to worship;
    And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
  }

# Acts 7:44
  Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness,
  as He appointed,
  instructing Moses to make it
  according to the pattern that he had seen,
# Acts 7:45
  which our fathers,
  having received it in turn,
  also brought with Joshua
  into the land possessed by the Gentiles,
  whom God drove out before the face of our fathers
  until the days of David,
# Acts 7:46
  who found favor before God
  and asked to find a dwelling for the God of Jacob.

# Acts 7:47
  But Solomon built Him a house.

# Acts 7:48
  However,
  the Most High does not dwell
  in temples made with hands,
  as the prophet says:
  {
# Acts 7:49
    Heaven is My throne,
    And earth is My footstool.

    What house will you build for Me?
  }
  says the Lord,
  {
    Or what is the place of My rest?

# Acts 7:50
    Has My hand not made all these things?
  }

# Acts 7:51
  You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears!

  You always resist the Holy Spirit;
  as your fathers did, so do you.

# Acts 7:52
  Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?

  And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One,
  of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers,
# Acts 7:53
  who have received the law by the direction of angels
  and have not kept it.
}

# Acts 7:54
When they heard these things they were cut to the heart,
and they gnashed at him with their teeth.

# Acts 7:55
But he, being full of the Holy Spirit,
gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God,
and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,
# Acts 7:56
and said,
{
  Look!

  I see the heavens opened
  and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!
}

# Acts 7:57
Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears,
and ran at him with one accord;
# Acts 7:58
and they cast him out of the city and stoned him.

And the witnesses laid down their clothes
at the feet of a young man named Saul.

# Acts 7:59
And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God and saying,
{
  Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
}

# Acts 7:60
Then he knelt down and cried out
with a loud voice,
{
  Lord, do not charge them with this sin.
}

And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

# Acts 8:1
Now Saul was consenting to his death.

At that time a great persecution arose against the church
which was at Jerusalem;
and they were all scattered
throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria,
except the apostles.

# Acts 8:2
And devout men carried Stephen to his burial,
and made great lamentation over him.

# Acts 8:3
As for Saul, he made havoc of the church,
entering every house,
and dragging off men and women,
committing them to prison.

# Acts 8:4
Therefore
those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the word.

# Acts 8:5
Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria
and preached Christ to them.

# Acts 8:6
And the multitudes with one accord
heeded the things spoken by Philip,
hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.

# Acts 8:7
For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice,
came out of many who were possessed;
and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.

# Acts 8:8
And there was great joy in that city.

# Acts 8:9
But there was a certain man called Simon,
who previously practiced sorcery in the city
and astonished the people of Samaria,
claiming that he was someone great,
# Acts 8:10
to whom they all gave heed,
from the least to the greatest, saying,
{
  This man is the great power of God.
}

# Acts 8:11
And they heeded him
because he had astonished them with his sorceries
for a long time.

# Acts 8:12
But when they believed Philip
as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God
and the name of Jesus Christ,
both men and women were baptized.

# Acts 8:13
Then Simon himself also believed;
and when he was baptized he continued with Philip,
and was amazed,
seeing the miracles and signs which were done.

# Acts 8:14
Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem
heard that Samaria had received the word of God,
they sent Peter and John to them,
# Acts 8:15
who, when they had come down,
prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.

# Acts 8:16
For as yet He had fallen upon none of them.

They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

# Acts 8:17
Then they laid hands on them,
and they received the Holy Spirit.

# Acts 8:18
And when Simon saw
that through the laying on of the apostles' hands
the Holy Spirit was given,
he offered them money,
# Acts 8:19
saying,
{
  Give me this power also,
  that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit.
}

# Acts 8:20
But Peter said to him,
{
  Your money perish with you,
  because you thought
  that the gift of God could be purchased with money!

  # Acts 8:21
  You have neither part nor portion in this matter,
  for your heart is not right in the sight of God.

  # Acts 8:22
  Repent therefore of this your wickedness,
  and pray God
  if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.

# Acts 8:23
  For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness
  and bound by iniquity.
}

# Acts 8:24
Then Simon answered and said,
{
  Pray to the Lord for me,
  that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.
}

# Acts 8:25
So when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord,
they returned to Jerusalem,
preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.

# Acts 8:26
Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying,
{
  Arise and go toward the south along the road
  which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.
}

This is desert.

# Acts 8:27
So he arose and went.

And behold, a man of Ethiopia,
a eunuch of great authority
under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians,
who had charge of all her treasury,
and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
# Acts 8:28
was returning.

And sitting in his chariot,
he was reading Isaiah the prophet.

# Acts 8:29
Then the Spirit said to Philip,
{
  Go near and overtake this chariot.
}

# Acts 8:30
So Philip ran to him,
and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said,
{
  Do you understand what you are reading?
}

# Acts 8:31
And he said,
{
  How can I, unless someone guides me?
}

And he asked Philip to come up and sit with him.

# Acts 8:32
The place in the Scripture which he read was this:
{
  He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
  And as a lamb before its shearer is silent,
  So He opened not His mouth.

# Acts 8:33
  In His humiliation His justice was taken away,
  And who will declare His generation?

  For His life is taken from the earth.
}

# Acts 8:34
So the eunuch answered Philip and said,
{
  I ask you, of whom does the prophet say this,
  of himself or of some other man?
}

# Acts 8:35
Then Philip opened his mouth,
and beginning at this Scripture,
preached Jesus to him.

# Acts 8:36
Now as they went down the road,
they came to some water.

And the eunuch said,
{
  See, here is water.

  What hinders me from being baptized?
}

# Acts 8:37
Then Philip said,
{
  If you believe with all your heart, you may.
}

And he answered and said,
{
  I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
}

# Acts 8:38
So he commanded the chariot to stand still.

And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water,
and he baptized him.

# Acts 8:39
Now when they came up out of the water,
the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away,
so that the eunuch saw him no more;
and he went on his way rejoicing.

# Acts 8:40
But Philip was found at Azotus.

And passing through,
he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea.

# Acts 9:1
Then Saul, still breathing threats and murder
against the disciples of the Lord,
went to the high priest
# Acts 9:2
and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus,
so that if he found any who were of the Way,
whether men or women,
he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.

# Acts 9:3
As he journeyed he came near Damascus,
and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven.

# Acts 9:4
Then he fell to the ground,
and heard a voice saying to him,
{
  Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?
}

# Acts 9:5
And he said,
{
  Who are You, Lord?
}

Then the Lord said,
{
  I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.

  It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
}

# Acts 9:6
So he, trembling and astonished, said,
{
  Lord, what do You want me to do?
}

Then the Lord said to him,
{
  Arise and go into the city,
  and you will be told what you must do.
}

# Acts 9:7
And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless,
hearing a voice but seeing no one.

# Acts 9:8
Then Saul arose from the ground,
and when his eyes were opened he saw no one.

But they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.

# Acts 9:9
And he was three days without sight,
and neither ate nor drank.

# Acts 9:10
Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias;
and to him the Lord said in a vision,
{
  Ananias.
}

And he said,
{
  Here I am, Lord.
}

# Acts 9:11
So the Lord said to him,
{
  Arise and go to the street called Straight,
  and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus,
  for behold, he is praying.

# Acts 9:12
  And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias
  coming in and putting his hand on him,
  so that he might receive his sight.
}

# Acts 9:13
Then Ananias answered,
{
  Lord, I have heard from many about this man,
  how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem.

# Acts 9:14
  And here he has authority from the chief priests
  to bind all who call on Your name.
}

# Acts 9:15
But the Lord said to him,
{
  Go, for he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name
  before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel.

# Acts 9:16
  For I will show him how many things he must suffer
  for My name's sake.
}

# Acts 9:17
And Ananias went his way and entered the house;
and laying his hands on him he said,
{
  Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus,
  who appeared to you on the road as you came,
  has sent me that you may receive your sight
  and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
}

# Acts 9:18
Immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales,
and he received his sight at once;
and he arose and was baptized.

# Acts 9:19
So when he had received food,
he was strengthened.

Then Saul spent some days with the disciples at Damascus.

# Acts 9:20
Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues,
that He is the Son of God.

# Acts 9:21
Then all who heard were amazed, and said,
{
  Is this not he
  who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem,
  and has come here for that purpose,
  so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?
}

# Acts 9:22
But Saul increased all the more in strength,
and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus,
proving that this Jesus is the Christ.

# Acts 9:23
Now after many days were past, the Jews plotted to kill him.

# Acts 9:24
But their plot became known to Saul.

And they watched the gates day and night, to kill him.

# Acts 9:25
Then the disciples took him by night
and let him down through the wall in a large basket.

# Acts 9:26
And when Saul had come to Jerusalem,
he tried to join the disciples;
but they were all afraid of him,
and did not believe that he was a disciple.

# Acts 9:27
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles.

And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road,
and that He had spoken to him,
and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.

# Acts 9:28
So he was with them at Jerusalem,
coming in and going out.

# Acts 9:29
And he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus
and disputed against the Hellenists,
but they attempted to kill him.

# Acts 9:30
When the brethren found out,
they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him out to Tarsus.

# Acts 9:31
Then the churches
throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria
had peace and were edified.

And walking in the fear of the Lord
and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit,
they were multiplied.

# Acts 9:32
Now it came to pass,
as Peter went through all parts of the country,
that he also came down to the saints who dwelt in Lydda.

# Acts 9:33
There he found a certain man named Aeneas,
who had been bedridden 8 years and was paralyzed.

# Acts 9:34
And Peter said to him,
{
  Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you.

  Arise and make your bed.
}

Then he arose immediately.

# Acts 9:35
So all who dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him
and turned to the Lord.

# Acts 9:36
At Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha,
which is translated Dorcas.

This woman was full of good works and charitable deeds
which she did.

# Acts 9:37
But it happened in those days that she became sick and died.

When they had washed her,
they laid her in an upper room.

# Acts 9:38
And since Lydda was near Joppa,
and the disciples had heard that Peter was there,
they sent two men to him,
imploring him not to delay in coming to them.

# Acts 9:39
Then Peter arose and went with them.

When he had come,
they brought him to the upper room.

And all the widows stood by him weeping,
showing the tunics and garments which Dorcas had made
while she was with them.

# Acts 9:40
But Peter put them all out,
and knelt down and prayed.

And turning to the body he said,
{
  Tabitha, arise.
}

And she opened her eyes,
and when she saw Peter she sat up.

# Acts 9:41
Then he gave her his hand and lifted her up;
and when he had called the saints and widows,
he presented her alive.

# Acts 9:42
And it became known throughout all Joppa,
and many believed on the Lord.

# Acts 9:43
So it was that he stayed many days in Joppa with Simon, a tanner.

# Acts 10:1
There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius,
a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,
# Acts 10:2
a devout man and one who feared God with all his household,
who gave alms generously to the people,
and prayed to God always.

# Acts 10:3
About the ninth hour of the day
he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God
coming in and saying to him,
{
  Cornelius!
}

# Acts 10:4
And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said,
{
  What is it, lord?
}

So he said to him,
{
  Your prayers and your alms have come up
  for a memorial before God.

# Acts 10:5
  Now send men to Joppa,
  and send for Simon whose surname is Peter.

# Acts 10:6
  He is lodging with Simon, a tanner,
  whose house is by the sea.

  He will tell you what you must do.
}

# Acts 10:7
And when the angel who spoke to him had departed,
Cornelius called
two of his household servants and a devout soldier
from among those who waited on him continually.

# Acts 10:8
So when he had explained all these things to them,
he sent them to Joppa.

# Acts 10:9
The next day,
as they went on their journey and drew near the city,
Peter went up on the housetop to pray,
about the sixth hour.

# Acts 10:10
Then he became very hungry and wanted to eat;
but while they made ready,
he fell into a trance
# Acts 10:11
and saw heaven opened
and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners,
descending to him and let down to the earth.

# Acts 10:12
In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth,
wild beasts,
creeping things,
and birds of the air.

# Acts 10:13
And a voice came to him,
{
  Rise, Peter; kill and eat.
}

# Acts 10:14
But Peter said,
{
  Not so, Lord!

  For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.
}

# Acts 10:15
And a voice spoke to him again the second time,
{
  What God has cleansed you must not call common.
}

# Acts 10:16
This was done three times.

And the object was taken up into heaven again.

# Acts 10:17
Now while Peter wondered within himself
what this vision which he had seen meant,
behold,
the men who had been sent from Cornelius
had made inquiry for Simon's house,
and stood before the gate.

# Acts 10:18
And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter,
was lodging there.

# Acts 10:19
While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him,
{
  Behold, three men are seeking you.

# Acts 10:20
  Arise therefore,
  go down and go with them,
  doubting nothing;
  for I have sent them.
}

# Acts 10:21
Then Peter went down to the men
who had been sent to him from Cornelius,
and said,
{
  Yes, I am he whom you seek.

  For what reason have you come?
}

# Acts 10:22
And they said,
{
  Cornelius the centurion, a just man,
  one who fears God
  and has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews,
  was divinely instructed by a holy angel
  to summon you to his house,
  and to hear words from you.
}

# Acts 10:23
Then he invited them in and lodged them.

On the next day Peter went away with them,
and some brethren from Joppa accompanied him.

# Acts 10:24
And the following day they entered Caesarea.

Now Cornelius was waiting for them,
and had called together his relatives and close friends.

# Acts 10:25
As Peter was coming in,
Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him.

# Acts 10:26
But Peter lifted him up, saying,
{
  Stand up; I myself am also a man.
}

# Acts 10:27
And as he talked with him,
he went in and found many who had come together.

# Acts 10:28
Then he said to them,
{
  You know how unlawful it is
  for a Jewish man to keep company with
  or go to one of another nation.

  But God has shown me
  that I should not call any man common or unclean.

# Acts 10:29
  Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for.

  I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?
}

# Acts 10:30
So Cornelius said,
{
  Four days ago I was fasting until this hour;
  and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house,
  and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
# Acts 10:31
  and said,
  {
    Cornelius, your prayer has been heard,
    and your alms are remembered in the sight of God.

# Acts 10:32
    Send therefore to Joppa and call Simon here,
    whose surname is Peter.

    He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.

    When he comes, he will speak to you.
  }

# Acts 10:33
  So I sent to you immediately,
  and you have done well to come.

  Now therefore, we are all present before God,
  to hear all the things commanded you by God.
}

# Acts 10:34
Then Peter opened his mouth and said:
{
  In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality.

# Acts 10:35
  But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness
  is accepted by Him.

# Acts 10:36
  The word which God sent to the children of Israel,
  preaching peace through Jesus Christ --
  He is Lord of all --
# Acts 10:37
  that word you know,
  which was proclaimed throughout all Judea,
  and began from Galilee
  after the baptism which John preached:
# Acts 10:38
  how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
  with the Holy Spirit and with power,
  who went about doing good
  and healing all who were oppressed by the devil,
  for God was with Him.

# Acts 10:39
  And we are witnesses of all things which He did
  both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem,
  whom they killed by hanging on a tree.

# Acts 10:40
  Him God raised up on the third day,
  and showed Him openly,
# Acts 10:41
  not to all the people,
  but to witnesses chosen before by God,
  even to us who ate and drank with Him
  after He arose from the dead.

# Acts 10:42
  And He commanded us to preach to the people,
  and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God
  to be Judge of the living and the dead.

# Acts 10:43
  To Him all the prophets witness that,
  through His name,
  whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins.
}

# Acts 10:44
While Peter was still speaking these words,
the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word.

# Acts 10:45
And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished,
as many as came with Peter,
because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out
on the Gentiles also.

# Acts 10:46
For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.

Then Peter answered,
{
# Acts 10:47
  Can anyone forbid water,
  that these should not be baptized
  who have received the Holy Spirit
  just as we have?
}

# Acts 10:48
And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.

Then they asked him to stay a few days.

# Acts 11:1
Now the apostles and brethren who were in Judea
heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.

# Acts 11:2
And when Peter came up to Jerusalem,
those of the circumcision contended with him,
# Acts 11:3
saying,
{
  You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!
}

# Acts 11:4
But Peter explained it to them in order from the beginning,
saying:
{
# Acts 11:5
  I was in the city of Joppa praying;
  and in a trance I saw a vision,
  an object descending like a great sheet,
  let down from heaven by four corners;
  and it came to me.

# Acts 11:6
  When I observed it intently and considered,
  I saw four-footed animals of the earth,
  wild beasts,
  creeping things,
  and birds of the air.

# Acts 11:7
  And I heard a voice saying to me,
  {
    Rise, Peter; kill and eat.
  }

# Acts 11:8
  But I said,
  {
    Not so, Lord!

    For nothing common or unclean
    has at any time entered my mouth.
  }

# Acts 11:9
  But the voice answered me again from heaven,
  {
    What God has cleansed you must not call common.
  }

# Acts 11:10
  Now this was done three times,
  and all were drawn up again into heaven.

# Acts 11:11
  At that very moment,
  three men stood before the house where I was,
  having been sent to me from Caesarea.

# Acts 11:12
  Then the Spirit told me to go with them,
  doubting nothing.

  Moreover these six brethren accompanied me,
  and we entered the man's house.

# Acts 11:13
  And he told us how he had seen an angel
  standing in his house,
  who said to him,
  {
    Send men to Joppa,
    and call for Simon whose surname is Peter,
# Acts 11:14
    who will tell you words
    by which you and all your household
    will be saved.
  }

# Acts 11:15
  And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them,
  as upon us at the beginning.

# Acts 11:16
  Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said,
  {
    John indeed baptized with water,
    but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
  }

# Acts 11:17
  If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us
  when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ,
  who was I that I could withstand God?
}

# Acts 11:18
When they heard these things they became silent;
and they glorified God, saying,
{
  Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.
}

# Acts 11:19
Now those who were scattered after the persecution
that arose over Stephen
traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch,
preaching the word to no one but the Jews only.

# Acts 11:20
But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene,
who,
when they had come to Antioch,
spoke to the Hellenists,
preaching the Lord Jesus.

# Acts 11:21
And the hand of the Lord was with them,
and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.

# Acts 11:22
Then news of these things
came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem,
and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.

# Acts 11:23
When he came and had seen the grace of God,
he was glad,
and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart
they should continue with the Lord.

# Acts 11:24
For he was a good man,
full of the Holy Spirit and of faith.

And a great many people were added to the Lord.

# Acts 11:25
Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul.

# Acts 11:26
And when he had found him,
he brought him to Antioch.

So it was that for a whole year
they assembled with the church and taught a great many people.

And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

# Acts 11:27
And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.

# Acts 11:28
Then one of them, named Agabus,
stood up and showed by the Spirit
that there was going to be a great famine
throughout all the world,
which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar.

# Acts 11:29
Then the disciples, each according to his ability,
determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea.

# Acts 11:30
This they also did,
and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

# Acts 12:1
Now about that time
Herod the king stretched out his hand
to harass some from the church.

# Acts 12:2
Then he killed James the brother of John with the sword.

# Acts 12:3
And because he saw that it pleased the Jews,
he proceeded further to seize Peter also.

Now it was during the Days of Unleavened Bread.

# Acts 12:4
So when he had arrested him,
he put him in prison,
and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to keep him,
intending to bring him before the people after Passover.

# Acts 12:5
Peter was therefore kept in prison,
but constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church.

# Acts 12:6
And when Herod was about to bring him out,
that night Peter was sleeping,
bound with two chains between two soldiers;
and the guards before the door were keeping the prison.

# Acts 12:7
Now behold, an angel of the Lord stood by him,
and a light shone in the prison;
and he struck Peter on the side and raised him up, saying,
{
  Arise quickly!
}

And his chains fell off his hands.

# Acts 12:8
Then the angel said to him,
{
  Gird yourself and tie on your sandals
};
and so he did.

And he said to him,
{
  Put on your garment and follow me.
}

# Acts 12:9
So he went out and followed him,
and did not know that what was done by the angel was real,
but thought he was seeing a vision.

# Acts 12:10
When they were past the first and the second guard posts,
they came to the iron gate that leads to the city,
which opened to them of its own accord;
and they went out and went down one street,
and immediately the angel departed from him.

# Acts 12:11
And when Peter had come to himself, he said,
{
  Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel,
  and has delivered me from the hand of Herod
  and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.
}

# Acts 12:12
So, when he had considered this, he came to the house of Mary,
the mother of John whose surname was Mark,
where many were gathered together praying.

# Acts 12:13
And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate,
a girl named Rhoda came to answer.

# Acts 12:14
When she recognized Peter's voice,
because of her gladness she did not open the gate,
but ran in and announced that Peter stood before the gate.

# Acts 12:15
But they said to her,
{
  You are beside yourself!
}

Yet she kept insisting that it was so.

So they said,
{
  It is his angel.
}

# Acts 12:16
Now Peter continued knocking;
and when they opened the door and saw him,
they were astonished.

# Acts 12:17
But motioning to them with his hand to keep silent,
he declared to them
how the Lord had brought him out of the prison.

And he said,
{
  Go, tell these things to James and to the brethren.
}

And he departed and went to another place.

# Acts 12:18
Then, as soon as it was day,
there was no small stir among the soldiers
about what had become of Peter.

# Acts 12:19
But when Herod had searched for him and not found him,
he examined the guards
and commanded that they should be put to death.

And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and stayed there.

# Acts 12:20
Now Herod had been very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon;
but they came to him with one accord,
and having made Blastus the king's personal aide their friend,
they asked for peace,
because their country was supplied with food
by the king's country.

# Acts 12:21
So on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel,
sat on his throne and gave an oration to them.

# Acts 12:22
And the people kept shouting,
{
  The voice of a god and not of a man!
}

# Acts 12:23
Then immediately an angel of the Lord struck him,
because he did not give glory to God.

And he was eaten by worms and died.

# Acts 12:24
But the word of God grew and multiplied.

# Acts 12:25
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem
when they had fulfilled their ministry,
and they also took with them John whose surname was Mark.

# Acts 13:1
Now in the church that was at Antioch
there were certain prophets and teachers:
  Barnabas,
  Simeon who was called Niger,
  Lucius of Cyrene,
  Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch,
  and Saul.

# Acts 13:2
As they ministered to the Lord and fasted,
the Holy Spirit said,
{
  Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul
  for the work to which I have called them.
}

# Acts 13:3
Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them,
they sent them away.

# Acts 13:4
So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit,
they went down to Seleucia,
and from there they sailed to Cyprus.

# Acts 13:5
And when they arrived in Salamis,
they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews.

They also had John as their assistant.

# Acts 13:6
Now when they had gone through the island to Paphos,
they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet,
a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,
# Acts 13:7
who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man.

This man called for Barnabas and Saul
and sought to hear the word of God.

# Acts 13:8
But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated)
withstood them,
seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.

# Acts 13:9
Then Saul, who also is called Paul,
filled with the Holy Spirit,
looked intently at him
# Acts 13:10
and said,
{
  O full of all deceit and all fraud,
  you son of the devil,
  you enemy of all righteousness,
  will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?

# Acts 13:11
  And now, indeed, the hand of the Lord is upon you,
  and you shall be blind,
  not seeing the sun for a time.
}

And immediately a dark mist fell on him,
and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.

# Acts 13:12
Then the proconsul believed,
when he saw what had been done,
being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.

# Acts 13:13
Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos,
they came to Perga in Pamphylia;
and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.

# Acts 13:14
But when they departed from Perga,
they came to Antioch in Pisidia,
and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.

# Acts 13:15
And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets,
the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying,
{
  Men and brethren,
  if you have any word of exhortation for the people,
  say on.
}

# Acts 13:16
Then Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said,
{
  Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:

# Acts 13:17
  The God of this people Israel chose our fathers,
  and exalted the people
  when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt,
  and with an uplifted arm He brought them out of it.

# Acts 13:18
  Now for a time of about 40 years
  He put up with their ways in the wilderness.

# Acts 13:19
  And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,
  He distributed their land to them by allotment.

# Acts 13:20
  After that He gave them judges for about 450 years,
  until Samuel the prophet.

# Acts 13:21
  And afterward they asked for a king;
  so God gave them Saul the son of Kish,
  a man of the tribe of Benjamin,
  for 40 years.

# Acts 13:22
  And when He had removed him,
  He raised up for them David as king,
  to whom also He gave testimony and said,
  {
    I have found David the son of Jesse,
    a man after My own heart,
    who will do all My will.
  }

# Acts 13:23
  From this man's seed,
  according to the promise,
  God raised up for Israel a Savior -- Jesus --
# Acts 13:24
  after John had first preached,
  before His coming,
  the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.

# Acts 13:25
  And as John was finishing his course, he said,
  {
    Who do you think I am?

    I am not He.

    But behold, there comes One after me,
    the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.
  }

# Acts 13:26
  Men and brethren, sons of the family of Abraham,
  and those among you who fear God,
  to you the word of this salvation has been sent.

# Acts 13:27
  For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers,
  because they did not know Him,
  nor even the voices of the Prophets
  which are read every Sabbath,
  have fulfilled them in condemning Him.

# Acts 13:28
  And though they found no cause for death in Him,
  they asked Pilate that He should be put to death.

# Acts 13:29
  Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him,
  they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.

# Acts 13:30
  But God raised Him from the dead.

# Acts 13:31
  He was seen for many days
  by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem,
  who are His witnesses to the people.

# Acts 13:32
  And we declare to you glad tidings --
  that promise which was made to the fathers.

# Acts 13:33
  God has fulfilled this for us their children,
  in that He has raised up Jesus.

  As it is also written in the second Psalm:
  {
    You are My Son,
    Today I have begotten You.
  }

# Acts 13:34
  And that He raised Him from the dead,
  no more to return to corruption,
  He has spoken thus:
  {
    I will give you the sure mercies of David.
  }

# Acts 13:35
  Therefore He also says in another Psalm:
  {
    You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.
  }

# Acts 13:36
  For David,
  after he had served his own generation
  by the will of God,
  fell asleep,
  was buried with his fathers,
  and saw corruption;
# Acts 13:37
  but He whom God raised up saw no corruption.

# Acts 13:38
  Therefore let it be known to you, brethren,
  that through this Man
  is preached to you the forgiveness of sins;
# Acts 13:39
  and by Him everyone who believes is justified
  from all things
  from which you could not be justified
  by the law of Moses.

# Acts 13:40
  Beware therefore,
  lest what has been spoken in the prophets come upon you:
  {
# Acts 13:41
    Behold, you despisers,
    Marvel and perish!

    For I work a work in your days,
    A work which you will by no means believe,
    Though one were to declare it to you.
  }
}

# Acts 13:42
So when the Jews went out of the synagogue,
the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them
the next Sabbath.

# Acts 13:43
Now when the congregation had broken up,
many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas,
who, speaking to them,
persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.

# Acts 13:44
On the next Sabbath
almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.

# Acts 13:45
But when the Jews saw the multitudes,
they were filled with envy;
and contradicting and blaspheming,
they opposed the things spoken by Paul.

# Acts 13:46
Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said,
{
  It was necessary
  that the word of God should be spoken to you first;
  but since you reject it,
  and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,
  behold, we turn to the Gentiles.

# Acts 13:47
  For so the Lord has commanded us:
  {
    I have set you as a light to the Gentiles,
    That you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.
  }
}

# Acts 13:48
Now when the Gentiles heard this,
they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord.

And as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.

# Acts 13:49
And the word of the Lord was being spread
throughout all the region.

# Acts 13:50
But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women
and the chief men of the city,
raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas,
and expelled them from their region.

# Acts 13:51
But they shook off the dust from their feet against them,
and came to Iconium.

# Acts 13:52
And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

# Acts 14:1
Now it happened in Iconium
that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews,
and so spoke that a great multitude
both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.

# Acts 14:2
But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles
and poisoned their minds
against the brethren.

# Acts 14:3
Therefore they stayed there a long time,
speaking boldly in the Lord,
who was bearing witness to the word of His grace,
granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.

# Acts 14:4
But the multitude of the city was divided:
  part sided with the Jews,
  and part with the apostles.

# Acts 14:5
And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews,
with their rulers,
to abuse and stone them,
# Acts 14:6
they became aware of it
and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia,
and to the surrounding region.

# Acts 14:7
And they were preaching the gospel there.

# Acts 14:8
And in Lystra
a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting,
a cripple from his mother's womb, who had never walked.

# Acts 14:9
This man heard Paul speaking.

Paul,
observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed,
# Acts 14:10
said with a loud voice,
{
  Stand up straight on your feet!
}

And he leaped and walked.

# Acts 14:11
Now when the people saw what Paul had done,
they raised their voices,
saying in the Lycaonian language,
{
  The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!
}

# Acts 14:12
And Barnabas they called Zeus,
and Paul, Hermes,
because he was the chief speaker.

# Acts 14:13
Then the priest of Zeus,
whose temple was in front of their city,
brought oxen and garlands to the gates,
intending to sacrifice with the multitudes.

# Acts 14:14
But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this,
they tore their clothes and ran in among the multitude,
crying out
# Acts 14:15
and saying,
{
  Men, why are you doing these things?

  We also are men with the same nature as you,
  and preach to you that you should turn
  from these useless things to the living God,
  who made the heaven,
  the earth,
  the sea,
  and all things that are in them,
# Acts 14:16
  who in bygone generations
  allowed all nations to walk in their own ways.

# Acts 14:17
  Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness,
  in that He did good,
  gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons,
  filling our hearts with food and gladness.
}

# Acts 14:18
And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes
from sacrificing to them.

# Acts 14:19
Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there;
and having persuaded the multitudes,
they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city,
supposing him to be dead.

# Acts 14:20
However, when the disciples gathered around him,
he rose up and went into the city.

And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.

# Acts 14:21
And when they had preached the gospel to that city
and made many disciples,
they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
# Acts 14:22
strengthening the souls of the disciples,
exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying,
{
  We must through many tribulations
  enter the kingdom of God.
}

# Acts 14:23
So when they had appointed elders in every church,
and prayed with fasting,
they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.

# Acts 14:24
And after they had passed through Pisidia,
they came to Pamphylia.

# Acts 14:25
Now when they had preached the word in Perga,
they went down to Attalia.

# Acts 14:26
From there they sailed to Antioch,
where they had been commended to the grace of God
for the work which they had completed.

# Acts 14:27
Now when they had come and gathered the church together,
they reported all that God had done with them,
and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.

# Acts 14:28
So they stayed there a long time with the disciples.

# Acts 15:1
And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren,
{
  Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses,
  you cannot be saved.
}

# Acts 15:2
Therefore,
when Paul and Barnabas
had no small dissension and dispute with them,
they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them
should go up to Jerusalem,
to the apostles and elders,
about this question.

# Acts 15:3
So, being sent on their way by the church,
they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria,
describing the conversion of the Gentiles;
and they caused great joy to all the brethren.

# Acts 15:4
And when they had come to Jerusalem,
they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders;
and they reported all things that God had done with them.

# Acts 15:5
But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up,
saying,
{
  It is necessary to circumcise them,
  and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
}

# Acts 15:6
Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.

# Acts 15:7
And when there had been much dispute,
Peter rose up and said to them:
{
  Men and brethren,
  you know that a good while ago God chose among us,
  that by my mouth
  the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.

# Acts 15:8
  So God, who knows the heart,
  acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit,
  just as He did to us,
# Acts 15:9
  and made no distinction between us and them,
  purifying their hearts by faith.

# Acts 15:10
  Now therefore,
  why do you test God
  by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples
  which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

# Acts 15:11
  But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ
  we shall be saved in the same manner as they.
}

# Acts 15:12
Then all the multitude kept silent
and listened to Barnabas and Paul
declaring how many miracles and wonders
God had worked through them
among the Gentiles.

# Acts 15:13
And after they had become silent, James answered, saying,
{
  Men and brethren, listen to me:

# Acts 15:14
  Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles
  to take out of them a people for His name.

# Acts 15:15
  And with this the words of the prophets agree,
  just as it is written:
  {
# Acts 15:16
    After this I will return
    And will rebuild the tabernacle of David,
    which has fallen down;
    I will rebuild its ruins,
    And I will set it up;
# Acts 15:17
    So that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord,
    Even all the Gentiles who are called by My name,
    Says the Lord who does all these things.
  }

# Acts 15:18
  Known to God from eternity are all His works.

# Acts 15:19
  Therefore I judge
  that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles
  who are turning to God,
# Acts 15:20
  but that we write to them
  to abstain from things polluted by idols,
  from sexual immorality,
  from things strangled,
  and from blood.

# Acts 15:21
  For Moses has had throughout many generations
  those who preach him in every city,
  being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.
}

# Acts 15:22
Then it pleased the apostles and elders,
with the whole church,
to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch
with Paul and Barnabas,
namely, Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas,
leading men among the brethren.

# Acts 15:23
They wrote this letter by them:

  The apostles, the elders, and the brethren,

  To the brethren who are of the Gentiles
  in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:

  Greetings.

# Acts 15:24
  Since we have heard that some who went out from us
  have troubled you with words,
  unsettling your souls, saying,
  {
    You must be circumcised and keep the law
  }--
  to whom we gave no such commandment --
# Acts 15:25
  it seemed good to us,
  being assembled with one accord,
  to send chosen men to you
  with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
# Acts 15:26
  men who have risked their lives
  for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

# Acts 15:27
  We have therefore sent Judas and Silas,
  who will also report the same things by word of mouth.

# Acts 15:28
  For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us,
  to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
# Acts 15:29
  that you abstain from things offered to idols,
  from blood,
  from things strangled,
  and from sexual immorality.

  If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well.

  Farewell.

# Acts 15:30
So when they were sent off, they came to Antioch;
and when they had gathered the multitude together,
they delivered the letter.

# Acts 15:31
When they had read it,
they rejoiced over its encouragement.

# Acts 15:32
Now Judas and Silas,
themselves being prophets also,
exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words.

# Acts 15:33
And after they had stayed there for a time,
they were sent back with greetings from the brethren
to the apostles.

# Acts 15:34
However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there.

# Acts 15:35
Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch,
teaching and preaching the word of the Lord,
with many others also.

# Acts 15:36
Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas,
{
  Let us now go back and visit our brethren
  in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord,
  and see how they are doing.
}

# Acts 15:37
Now Barnabas was determined to take with them John called Mark.

# Acts 15:38
But Paul insisted that they should not take with them
the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia,
and had not gone with them to the work.

# Acts 15:39
Then the contention became so sharp
that they parted from one another.

And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus;
# Acts 15:40
but Paul chose Silas and departed,
being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.

# Acts 15:41
And he went through Syria and Cilicia,
strengthening the churches.

# Acts 16:1
Then he came to Derbe and Lystra.

And behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy,
the son of a certain Jewish woman who believed,
but his father was Greek.

# Acts 16:2
He was well spoken of by the brethren
who were at Lystra and Iconium.

# Acts 16:3
Paul wanted to have him go on with him.

And he took him and circumcised him
because of the Jews who were in that region,
for they all knew that his father was Greek.

# Acts 16:4
And as they went through the cities,
they delivered to them the decrees to keep,
which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.

# Acts 16:5
So the churches were strengthened in the faith,
and increased in number daily.

# Acts 16:6
Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia,
they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit
to preach the word in Asia.

# Acts 16:7
After they had come to Mysia,
they tried to go into Bithynia,
but the Spirit did not permit them.

# Acts 16:8
So passing by Mysia,
they came down to Troas.

# Acts 16:9
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night.

A man of Macedonia stood and pleaded with him,
saying,
{
  Come over to Macedonia and help us.
}

# Acts 16:10
Now after he had seen the vision,
immediately we sought to go to Macedonia,
concluding that the Lord had called us
to preach the gospel to them.

# Acts 16:11
Therefore, sailing from Troas,
we ran a straight course to Samothrace,
and the next day came to Neapolis,
# Acts 16:12
and from there to Philippi,
which is the foremost city of that part of Macedonia,
a colony.

And we were staying in that city for some days.

# Acts 16:13
And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside,
where prayer was customarily made;
and we sat down and spoke to the women who met there.

# Acts 16:14
Now a certain woman named Lydia heard us.

She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira,
who worshiped God.

The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul.

# Acts 16:15
And when she and her household were baptized,
she begged us, saying,
{
  If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord,
  come to my house and stay.
}

So she persuaded us.

# Acts 16:16
Now it happened, as we went to prayer,
that a certain slave girl
possessed with a spirit of divination met us,
who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling.

# Acts 16:17
This girl followed Paul and us,
and cried out, saying,
{
  These men are the servants of the Most High God,
  who proclaim to us the way of salvation.
}

# Acts 16:18
And this she did for many days.

But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit,
{
  I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.
}

And he came out that very hour.

# Acts 16:19
But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone,
they seized Paul and Silas
and dragged them into the marketplace to the authorities.

# Acts 16:20
And they brought them to the magistrates,
and said,
{
  These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city;
# Acts 16:21
  and they teach customs which are not lawful for us,
  being Romans,
  to receive or observe.
}

# Acts 16:22
Then the multitude rose up together against them;
and the magistrates tore off their clothes
and commanded them to be beaten with rods.

# Acts 16:23
And when they had laid many stripes on them,
they threw them into prison,
commanding the jailer to keep them securely.

# Acts 16:24
Having received such a charge,
he put them into the inner prison
and fastened their feet in the stocks.

# Acts 16:25
But at midnight
Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God,
and the prisoners were listening to them.

# Acts 16:26
Suddenly there was a great earthquake,
so that the foundations of the prison were shaken;
and immediately
all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were loosed.

# Acts 16:27
And the keeper of the prison,
awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open,
supposing the prisoners had fled,
drew his sword and was about to kill himself.

# Acts 16:28
But Paul called with a loud voice, saying,
{
  Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.
}

# Acts 16:29
Then he called for a light, ran in,
and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.

# Acts 16:30
And he brought them out and said,
{
  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
}

# Acts 16:31
So they said,
{
  Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved,
  you and your household.
}

# Acts 16:32
Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him
and to all who were in his house.

# Acts 16:33
And he took them the same hour of the night
and washed their stripes.

# Acts 16:34
And he took them the same hour of the night
And immediately he and all his family were baptized.

# Acts 16:35
Now when he had brought them into his house,
he set food before them;
and he rejoiced,
having believed in God with all his household.

# Acts 16:36
And when it was day,
the magistrates sent the officers,
saying,
{
  Let those men go.
}

# Acts 16:37
So the keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul,
saying,
{
  The magistrates have sent to let you go.

  Now therefore depart, and go in peace.
}

# Acts 16:38
But Paul said to them,
{
  They have beaten us openly, uncondemned Romans,
  and have thrown us into prison.

  And now do they put us out secretly?

  No indeed!

  Let them come themselves and get us out.
}

# Acts 16:39
And the officers told these words to the magistrates,
and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.

# Acts 16:40
Then they came and pleaded with them and brought them out,
and asked them to depart from the city.

# Acts 16:41
So they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia;
and when they had seen the brethren,
they encouraged them and departed.

# Acts 17:1
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia,
they came to Thessalonica,
where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

# Acts 17:2
Then Paul, as his custom was, went in to them,
and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
# Acts 17:3
explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer
and rise again from the dead,
and saying,
{
  This Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.
}

# Acts 17:4
And some of them were persuaded;
and a great multitude of the devout Greeks,
and not a few of the leading women,
joined Paul and Silas.

# Acts 17:5
But the Jews who were not persuaded, becoming envious,
took some of the evil men from the marketplace,
and gathering a mob,
set all the city in an uproar
and attacked the house of Jason,
and sought to bring them out to the people.

# Acts 17:6
But when they did not find them,
they dragged Jason and some brethren
to the rulers of the city,
crying out,
{
  These who have turned the world upside down
  have come here too.

# Acts 17:7
  Jason has harbored them,
  and these are all acting
  contrary to the decrees of Caesar,
  saying there is another king -- Jesus.
}

# Acts 17:8
And they troubled the crowd and the rulers of the city
when they heard these things.

# Acts 17:9
So when they had taken security from Jason and the rest,
they let them go.

# Acts 17:10
Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away
by night
to Berea.

When they arrived,
they went into the synagogue of the Jews.

# Acts 17:11
These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica,
in that they received the word with all readiness,
and searched the Scriptures daily
to find out whether these things were so.

# Acts 17:12
Therefore many of them believed,
and also not a few of the Greeks,
prominent women as well as men.

# Acts 17:13
But when the Jews from Thessalonica
learned that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea,
they came there also and stirred up the crowds.

# Acts 17:14
Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away,
to go to the sea;
but both Silas and Timothy remained there.

# Acts 17:15
So those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens;
and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy
to come to him with all speed,
they departed.

# Acts 17:16
Now while Paul waited for them at Athens,
his spirit was provoked within him
when he saw that the city was given over to idols.

# Acts 17:17
Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue
with the Jews and with the Gentile worshipers,
and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there.

# Acts 17:18
Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him.

And some said,
{
  What does this babbler want to say?
}

Others said,
{
  He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,
}
because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.

# Acts 17:19
And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus,
saying,
{
  May we know what this new doctrine is of which you speak?

# Acts 17:20
  For you are bringing some strange things to our ears.

  Therefore we want to know what these things mean.
}

# Acts 17:21
For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there
spent their time in nothing else
but either to tell or to hear some new thing.

# Acts 17:22
Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said,
{
  Men of Athens,
  I perceive that in all things you are very religious;
# Acts 17:23
  for as I was passing through
  and considering the objects of your worship,
  I even found an altar with this inscription:

    TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.

  Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing,
  Him I proclaim to you:

# Acts 17:24
  God, who made the world and everything in it,
  since He is Lord of heaven and earth,
  does not dwell in temples made with hands.

# Acts 17:25
  Nor is He worshiped with men's hands,
  as though He needed anything,
  since He gives to all life, breath, and all things.

# Acts 17:26
  And He has made from one blood every nation of men
  to dwell on all the face of the earth,
  and has determined their preappointed times
  and the boundaries of their dwellings,
# Acts 17:27
  so that they should seek the Lord,
  in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him,
  though He is not far from each one of us;
# Acts 17:28
  for in Him we live and move and have our being,
  as also some of your own poets have said,
  {
    For we are also His offspring.
  }

# Acts 17:29
  Therefore, since we are the offspring of God,
  we ought not to think that the Divine Nature
  is like gold or silver or stone,
  something shaped by art and man's devising.

# Acts 17:30
  Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked,
  but now commands all men everywhere to repent,
# Acts 17:31
  because He has appointed a day
  on which He will judge the world
  in righteousness
  by the Man whom He has ordained.

  He has given assurance of this to all
  by raising Him from the dead.
}

# Acts 17:32
And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked,
while others said,
{
  We will hear you again on this matter.
}

# Acts 17:33
So Paul departed from among them.

# Acts 17:34
However, some men joined him and believed,
among them Dionysius the Areopagite,
a woman named Damaris,
and others with them.

# Acts 18:1
After these things Paul departed from Athens
and went to Corinth.

# Acts 18:2
And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus,
who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla
(because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome);
and he came to them.

# Acts 18:3
So, because he was of the same trade,
he stayed with them and worked;
for by occupation they were tentmakers.

# Acts 18:4
And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath,
and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.

# Acts 18:5
When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia,
Paul was compelled by the Spirit,
and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.

# Acts 18:6
But when they opposed him and blasphemed,
he shook his garments and said to them,
{
  Your blood be upon your own heads;
  I am clean.

  From now on I will go to the Gentiles.
}

# Acts 18:7
And he departed from there
and entered the house of a certain man named Justus,
one who worshiped God,
whose house was next door to the synagogue.

# Acts 18:8
Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue,
believed on the Lord with all his household.

And many of the Corinthians, hearing,
believed and were baptized.

# Acts 18:9
Now the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision,
{
  Do not be afraid,
  but speak, and do not keep silent;
# Acts 18:10
  for I am with you,
  and no one will attack you to hurt you;
  for I have many people in this city.
}

# Acts 18:11
And he continued there a year and six months,
teaching the word of God among them.

# Acts 18:12
When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia,
the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul
and brought him to the judgment seat,
# Acts 18:13
saying,
{
  This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.
}

# Acts 18:14
And when Paul was about to open his mouth,
Gallio said to the Jews,
{
  If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked crimes, O Jews,
  there would be reason why I should bear with you.

# Acts 18:15
  But if it is a question of words and names and your own law,
  look to it yourselves;
  for I do not want to be a judge of such matters.
}

# Acts 18:16
And he drove them from the judgment seat.

# Acts 18:17
Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes,
the ruler of the synagogue,
and beat him before the judgment seat.

But Gallio took no notice of these things.

# Acts 18:18
So Paul still remained a good while.

Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria,
and Priscilla and Aquila were with him.

He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea,
for he had taken a vow.

# Acts 18:19
And he came to Ephesus, and left them there;
but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.

# Acts 18:20
When they asked him to stay a longer time with them,
he did not consent,
# Acts 18:21
but took leave of them, saying,
{
  I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem;
  but I will return again to you,
  God willing.
}

And he sailed from Ephesus.

# Acts 18:22
And when he had landed at Caesarea,
and gone up and greeted the church,
he went down to Antioch.

# Acts 18:23
After he had spent some time there,
he departed
and went over the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order,
strengthening all the disciples.

# Acts 18:24
Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria,
an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures,
came to Ephesus.

# Acts 18:25
This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord;
and being fervent in spirit,
he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord,
though he knew only the baptism of John.

# Acts 18:26
So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue.

When Aquila and Priscilla heard him,
they took him aside
and explained to him the way of God more accurately.

# Acts 18:27
And when he desired to cross to Achaia,
the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him;
and when he arrived,
he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;
# Acts 18:28
for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly,
showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.

# Acts 19:1
And it happened, while Apollos was at Corinth,
that Paul, having passed through the upper regions,
came to Ephesus.

And finding some disciples
# Acts 19:2
he said to them,
{
  Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?
}

So they said to him,
{
  We have not so much as heard
  whether there is a Holy Spirit.
}

# Acts 19:3
And he said to them,
{
  Into what then were you baptized?
}

So they said,
{
  Into John's baptism.
}

# Acts 19:4
Then Paul said,
{
  John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance,
  saying to the people that they should believe on Him
  who would come after him,
  that is, on Christ Jesus.
}

# Acts 19:5
When they heard this,
they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.

# Acts 19:6
And when Paul had laid hands on them,
the Holy Spirit came upon them,
and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.

# Acts 19:7
Now the men were about twelve in all.

# Acts 19:8
And he went into the synagogue
and spoke boldly for three months,
reasoning and persuading
concerning the things of the kingdom of God.

# Acts 19:9
But when some were hardened and did not believe,
but spoke evil of the Way before the multitude,
he departed from them and withdrew the disciples,
reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.

# Acts 19:10
And this continued for two years,
so that all who dwelt in Asia
heard the word of the Lord Jesus,
both Jews and Greeks.

# Acts 19:11
Now God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul,
# Acts 19:12
so that even handkerchiefs or aprons
were brought from his body to the sick,
and the diseases left them
and the evil spirits went out of them.

# Acts 19:13
Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists
took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus
over those who had evil spirits, saying,
{
  We exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.
}

# Acts 19:14
Also there were seven sons of Sceva,
a Jewish chief priest, who did so.

# Acts 19:15
And the evil spirit answered and said,
{
  Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?
}

# Acts 19:16
Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them,
overpowered them,
and prevailed against them,
so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.

# Acts 19:17
This became known both to all Jews and Greeks
dwelling in Ephesus;
and fear fell on them all,
and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.

# Acts 19:18
And many who had believed
came confessing and telling their deeds.

# Acts 19:19
Also, many of those who had practiced magic
brought their books together
and burned them in the sight of all.

And they counted up the value of them,
and it totaled 50,000 pieces of silver.

# Acts 19:20
So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.

# Acts 19:21
When these things were accomplished,
Paul purposed in the Spirit,
when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia,
to go to Jerusalem,
saying,
{
  After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
}

# Acts 19:22
So he sent into Macedonia
two of those who ministered to him,
Timothy and Erastus,
but he himself stayed in Asia for a time.

# Acts 19:23
And about that time
there arose a great commotion about the Way.

# Acts 19:24
For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith,
who made silver shrines of Diana,
brought no small profit to the craftsmen.

# Acts 19:25
He called them together
with the workers of similar occupation,
and said:
{
  Men, you know that we have our prosperity by this trade.

# Acts 19:26
  Moreover you see and hear that not only at Ephesus,
  but throughout almost all Asia,
  this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people,
  saying that they are not gods which are made with hands.

# Acts 19:27
  So not only is this trade of ours
  in danger of falling into disrepute,
  but also the temple of the great goddess Diana
  may be despised
  and her magnificence destroyed,
  whom all Asia and the world worship.
}

# Acts 19:28
Now when they heard this,
they were full of wrath and cried out,
saying,
{
  Great is Diana of the Ephesians!
}

# Acts 19:29
So the whole city was filled with confusion,
and rushed into the theater with one accord,
having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians,
Paul's travel companions.

# Acts 19:30
And when Paul wanted to go in to the people,
the disciples would not allow him.

# Acts 19:31
Then some of the officials of Asia,
who were his friends,
sent to him pleading
that he would not venture into the theater.

# Acts 19:32
Some therefore cried one thing and some another,
for the assembly was confused,
and most of them did not know why they had come together.

# Acts 19:33
And they drew Alexander out of the multitude,
the Jews putting him forward.

And Alexander motioned with his hand,
and wanted to make his defense to the people.

# Acts 19:34
But when they found out that he was a Jew,
all with one voice cried out for about two hours,
{
  Great is Diana of the Ephesians!
}

# Acts 19:35
And when the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said:
{
  Men of Ephesus,
  what man is there
  who does not know that the city of the Ephesians
  is temple guardian of the great goddess Diana,
  and of the image which fell down from Zeus?

# Acts 19:36
  Therefore, since these things cannot be denied,
  you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly.

# Acts 19:37
  For you have brought these men here
  who are neither robbers of temples
  nor blasphemers of your goddess.

# Acts 19:38
  Therefore,
  if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen
  have a case against anyone,
  the courts are open and there are proconsuls.

  Let them bring charges against one another.

# Acts 19:39
  But if you have any other inquiry to make,
  it shall be determined in the lawful assembly.

# Acts 19:40
  For we are in danger of being called in question
  for today's uproar,
  there being no reason which we may give
  to account for this disorderly gathering.
}

# Acts 19:41
And when he had said these things,
he dismissed the assembly.

# Acts 20:1
After the uproar had ceased,
Paul called the disciples to himself,
embraced them,
and departed to go to Macedonia.

# Acts 20:2
Now when he had gone over that region
and encouraged them with many words,
he came to Greece
# Acts 20:3
and stayed three months.

And when the Jews plotted against him
as he was about to sail to Syria,
he decided to return through Macedonia.

# Acts 20:4
And Sopater of Berea accompanied him to Asia --
also Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians,
and Gaius of Derbe,
and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.

# Acts 20:5
These men, going ahead, waited for us at Troas.

# Acts 20:6
But we sailed away from Philippi
after the Days of Unleavened Bread,
and in five days joined them at Troas,
where we stayed seven days.

# Acts 20:7
Now on the first day of the week,
when the disciples came together to break bread,
Paul, ready to depart the next day,
spoke to them and continued his message until midnight.

# Acts 20:8
There were many lamps in the upper room
where they were gathered together.

# Acts 20:9
And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus,
who was sinking into a deep sleep.

He was overcome by sleep;
and as Paul continued speaking,
he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.

# Acts 20:10
But Paul went down, fell on him, and embracing him said,
{
  Do not trouble yourselves,
  for his life is in him.
}

# Acts 20:11
Now when he had come up,
had broken bread and eaten,
and talked a long while,
even till daybreak,
he departed.

# Acts 20:12
And they brought the young man in alive,
and they were not a little comforted.

# Acts 20:13
Then we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos,
there intending to take Paul on board;
for so he had given orders,
intending himself to go on foot.

# Acts 20:14
And when he met us at Assos,
we took him on board and came to Mitylene.

# Acts 20:15
We sailed from there,
and the next day came opposite Chios.

The following day we arrived at Samos
and stayed at Trogyllium.

The next day we came to Miletus.

# Acts 20:16
For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus,
so that he would not have to spend time in Asia;
for he was hurrying to be at Jerusalem,
if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.

# Acts 20:17
From Miletus he sent to Ephesus
and called for the elders of the church.

# Acts 20:18
And when they had come to him,
he said to them:
{
  You know, from the first day that I came to Asia,
  in what manner I always lived among you,
# Acts 20:19
  serving the Lord with all humility,
  with many tears and trials
  which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews;
# Acts 20:20
  how I kept back nothing that was helpful,
  but proclaimed it to you,
  and taught you publicly and from house to house,
# Acts 20:21
  testifying to Jews,
  and also to Greeks,
  repentance toward God
  and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

# Acts 20:22
  And see, now I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem,
  not knowing the things that will happen to me there,
# Acts 20:23
  except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city,
  saying that chains and tribulations await me.

# Acts 20:24
  But none of these things move me;
  nor do I count my life dear to myself,
  so that I may finish my race with joy,
  and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus,
  to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.

# Acts 20:25
  And indeed, now I know that you all,
  among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God,
  will see my face no more.

# Acts 20:26
  Therefore I testify to you this day
  that I am innocent of the blood of all men.

# Acts 20:27
  For I have not shunned
  to declare to you the whole counsel of God.

# Acts 20:28
  Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock,
  among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers,
  to shepherd the church of God
  which He purchased with His own blood.

# Acts 20:29
  For I know this,
  that after my departure
  savage wolves will come in among you,
  not sparing the flock.

# Acts 20:30
  Also from among yourselves men will rise up,
  speaking perverse things,
  to draw away the disciples after themselves.

# Acts 20:31
  Therefore watch,
  and remember that
  for three years
  I did not cease
  to warn everyone
  night and day with tears.

# Acts 20:32
  So now, brethren,
  I commend you to God and to the word of His grace,
  which is able to build you up
  and give you an inheritance
  among all those who are sanctified.

# Acts 20:33
  I have coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.

# Acts 20:34
  Yes, you yourselves know
  that these hands have provided for my necessities,
  and for those who were with me.

# Acts 20:35
  I have shown you in every way,
  by laboring like this,
  that you must support the weak.

  And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said,
  {
    It is more blessed to give than to receive.
  }
}

# Acts 20:36
And when he had said these things,
he knelt down and prayed with them all.

# Acts 20:37
Then they all wept freely,
and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,
# Acts 20:38
sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke,
that they would see his face no more.

And they accompanied him to the ship.

# Acts 21:1
Now it came to pass,
that when we had departed from them and set sail,
running a straight course we came to Cos,
the following day to Rhodes,
and from there to Patara.

# Acts 21:2
And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia,
we went aboard and set sail.

# Acts 21:3
When we had sighted Cyprus,
we passed it on the left,
sailed to Syria,
and landed at Tyre;
for there the ship was to unload her cargo.

# Acts 21:4
And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days.

They told Paul through the Spirit
not to go up to Jerusalem.

# Acts 21:5
When we had come to the end of those days,
we departed and went on our way;
and they all accompanied us,
with wives and children,
till we were out of the city.

And we knelt down on the shore and prayed.

# Acts 21:6
When we had taken our leave of one another,
we boarded the ship,
and they returned home.

# Acts 21:7
And when we had finished our voyage from Tyre,
we came to Ptolemais,
greeted the brethren,
and stayed with them one day.

# Acts 21:8
On the next day
we who were Paul's companions departed and came to Caesarea,
and entered the house of Philip the evangelist,
who was one of the seven,
and stayed with him.

# Acts 21:9
Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.

# Acts 21:10
And as we stayed many days,
a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.

# Acts 21:11
When he had come to us,
he took Paul's belt,
bound his own hands and feet,
and said,
{
  Thus says the Holy Spirit,
  {
    So shall the Jews at Jerusalem
    bind the man who owns this belt,
    and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
  }
}

# Acts 21:12
Now when we heard these things,
both we and those from that place
pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem.

# Acts 21:13
Then Paul answered,
{
  What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart?

  For I am ready not only to be bound,
  but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
}

# Acts 21:14
So when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying,
{
  The will of the Lord be done.
}

# Acts 21:15
And after those days
we packed and went up to Jerusalem.

# Acts 21:16
Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us
and brought with them a certain Mnason of Cyprus,
an early disciple,
with whom we were to lodge.

# Acts 21:17
And when we had come to Jerusalem,
the brethren received us gladly.

# Acts 21:18
On the following day Paul went in with us to James,
and all the elders were present.

# Acts 21:19
When he had greeted them,
he told in detail those things
which God had done
among the Gentiles
through his ministry.

# Acts 21:20
And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord.

And they said to him,
{
  You see, brother,
  how many myriads of Jews there are who have believed,
  and they are all zealous for the law;
# Acts 21:21
  but they have been informed about you
  that you teach all the Jews
  who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses,
  saying that they ought not to circumcise their children
  nor to walk according to the customs.

# Acts 21:22
  What then?

  The assembly must certainly meet,
  for they will hear that you have come.

# Acts 21:23
  Therefore do what we tell you:
    We have four men who have taken a vow.

# Acts 21:24
  Take them and be purified with them,
  and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads,
  and that all may know that those things
  of which they were informed concerning you are nothing,
  but that you yourself also walk orderly and keep the law.

# Acts 21:25
  But concerning the Gentiles who believe,
  we have written and decided
  that they should observe no such thing,
  except that they should keep themselves
  from things offered to idols,
  from blood,
  from things strangled,
  and from sexual immorality.
}

# Acts 21:26
Then Paul took the men,
and the next day,
having been purified with them,
entered the temple
to announce the expiration of the days of purification,
at which time an offering should be made
for each one of them.

# Acts 21:27
Now when the seven days were almost ended,
the Jews from Asia,
seeing him in the temple,
stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,
# Acts 21:28
crying out,
{
  Men of Israel, help!

  This is the man who teaches all men everywhere
  against the people,
  the law,
  and this place;
  and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple
  and has defiled this holy place.
}

# Acts 21:29
(
  For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian
  with him in the city,
  whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.
)

# Acts 21:30
And all the city was disturbed;
and the people ran together,
seized Paul,
and dragged him out of the temple;
and immediately the doors were shut.

# Acts 21:31
Now as they were seeking to kill him,
news came to the commander of the garrison
that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.

# Acts 21:32
He immediately took soldiers and centurions,
and ran down to them.

And when they saw the commander and the soldiers,
they stopped beating Paul.

# Acts 21:33
Then the commander came near and took him,
and commanded him to be bound with two chains;
and he asked who he was and what he had done.

# Acts 21:34
And some among the multitude cried one thing and some another.

So when he could not ascertain the truth because of the tumult,
he commanded him to be taken into the barracks.

# Acts 21:35
When he reached the stairs,
he had to be carried by the soldiers
because of the violence of the mob.

# Acts 21:36
For the multitude of the people followed after, crying out,
{
  Away with him!
}

# Acts 21:37
Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks,
he said to the commander,
{
  May I speak to you?
}

He replied,
{
  Can you speak Greek?

# Acts 21:38
  Are you not the Egyptian
  who some time ago stirred up a rebellion
  and led the 4000 assassins out into the wilderness?
}

# Acts 21:39
But Paul said,
{
  I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia,
  a citizen of no mean city;
  and I implore you,
  permit me to speak to the people.
}

# Acts 21:40
So when he had given him permission,
Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people.

And when there was a great silence,
he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,
{
  Brethren and fathers,
  hear my defense before you now.
}

# Acts 21:41
And when they heard that he spoke to them in the Hebrew language,
they kept all the more silent.

Then he said:
{
# Acts 21:42
  I am indeed a Jew,
  born in Tarsus of Cilicia,
  but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel,
  taught according to the strictness of our fathers' law,
  and was zealous toward God as you all are today.

# Acts 21:43
  I persecuted this Way to the death,
  binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,
# Acts 21:44
  as also the high priest bears me witness,
  and all the council of the elders,
  from whom I also received letters to the brethren,
  and went to Damascus
  to bring in chains
  even those who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.

# Acts 21:45
  Now it happened,
  as I journeyed and came near Damascus at about noon,
  suddenly a great light from heaven shone around me.

# Acts 21:46
  And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me,
  {
    Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?
  }

# Acts 21:47
  So I answered,
  {
    Who are You, Lord?
  }

  And He said to me,
  {
    I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.
  }

# Acts 21:48
  And those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid,
  but they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me.

# Acts 21:49
  So I said,
  {
    What shall I do, Lord?
  }

  And the Lord said to me,
  {
    Arise and go into Damascus,
    and there you will be told all things
    which are appointed for you to do.
  }

# Acts 21:50
  And since I could not see for the glory of that light,
  being led by the hand of those who were with me,
  I came into Damascus.

# Acts 21:51
  Then a certain Ananias,
  a devout man according to the law,
  having a good testimony with all the Jews who dwelt there,
# Acts 21:52
  came to me;
  and he stood and said to me,
  {
    Brother Saul, receive your sight.
  }

  And at that same hour I looked up at him.

# Acts 21:53
  Then he said,
  {
    The God of our fathers has chosen you
    that you should know His will,
    and see the Just One,
    and hear the voice of His mouth.

# Acts 21:54
    For you will be His witness to all men
    of what you have seen and heard.

# Acts 21:55
    And now why are you waiting?

    Arise and be baptized,
    and wash away your sins,
    calling on the name of the Lord.
  }

# Acts 21:56
  Now it happened,
  when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple,
  that I was in a trance
# Acts 21:57
  and saw Him saying to me,
  {
    Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly,
    for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.
  }

# Acts 21:58
  So I said,
  {
    Lord, they know that in every synagogue
    I imprisoned and beat those who believe on You.

# Acts 21:59
    And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was shed,
    I also was standing by consenting to his death,
    and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.
  }

# Acts 21:60
  Then He said to me,
  {
    Depart, for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.
  }
}

# Acts 21:61
And they listened to him until this word,
and then they raised their voices and said,
{
  Away with such a fellow from the earth,
  for he is not fit to live!
}

# Acts 21:62
Then, as they cried out and tore off their clothes
and threw dust into the air,
# Acts 21:63
the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks,
and said that he should be examined under scourging,
so that he might know why they shouted so against him.

# Acts 21:64
And as they bound him with thongs,
Paul said to the centurion who stood by,
{
  Is it lawful for you
  to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?
}

# Acts 21:65
When the centurion heard that,
he went and told the commander,
saying,
{
  Take care what you do, for this man is a Roman.
}

# Acts 21:66
Then the commander came and said to him,
{
  Tell me, are you a Roman?
}

He said,
{
  Yes.
}

# Acts 21:67
The commander answered,
{
  With a large sum I obtained this citizenship.
}

And Paul said,
{
  But I was born a citizen.
}

# Acts 21:68
Then immediately those who were about to examine him
withdrew from him;
and the commander was also afraid
after he found out that he was a Roman,
and because he had bound him.

# Acts 21:69
The next day,
because he wanted to know for certain
why he was accused by the Jews,
he released him from his bonds,
and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear,
and brought Paul down and set him before them.

# Acts 22:1
Then Paul, looking earnestly at the council, said,
{
  Men and brethren,
  I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
}

# Acts 22:2
And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him
to strike him on the mouth.

# Acts 22:3
Then Paul said to him,
{
  God will strike you, you whitewashed wall!

  For you sit to judge me according to the law,
  and do you command me to be struck contrary to the law?
}

# Acts 22:4
And those who stood by said,
{
  Do you revile God's high priest?
}

# Acts 22:5
Then Paul said,
{
  I did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest;
  for it is written,
  {
    You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.
  }
}

# Acts 22:6
But when Paul perceived
that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees,
he cried out in the council,
{
  Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee;
  concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead
  I am being judged!
}

# Acts 22:7
And when he had said this,
a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees;
and the assembly was divided.

# Acts 22:8
For Sadducees say that there is no resurrection --
and no angel or spirit;
but the Pharisees confess both.

# Acts 22:9
Then there arose a loud outcry.

And the scribes of the Pharisees' party arose and protested,
saying,
  {
  We find no evil in this man;
  but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him,
  let us not fight against God.
}

# Acts 22:10
Now when there arose a great dissension,
the commander,
fearing lest Paul might be pulled to pieces by them,
commanded the soldiers to go down
and take him by force from among them,
and bring him into the barracks.

# Acts 22:11
But the following night the Lord stood by him and said,
{
  Be of good cheer, Paul;
  for as you have testified for Me in Jerusalem,
  so you must also bear witness at Rome.
}

# Acts 22:12
And when it was day,
some of the Jews banded together
and bound themselves under an oath,
saying that they would neither eat nor drink
till they had killed Paul.

# Acts 22:13
Now there were more than 40 who had formed this conspiracy.

# Acts 22:14
They came to the chief priests and elders, and said,
{
  We have bound ourselves under a great oath
  that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.

# Acts 22:15
  Now you, therefore, together with the council,
  suggest to the commander
  that he be brought down to you tomorrow,
  as though you were going
  to make further inquiries concerning him;
  but we are ready to kill him before he comes near.
}

# Acts 22:16
So when Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush,
he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.

# Acts 22:17
Then Paul called one of the centurions to him and said,
{
  Take this young man to the commander,
  for he has something to tell him.
}

# Acts 22:18
So he took him and brought him to the commander and said,
{
  Paul the prisoner called me to him
  and asked me to bring this young man to you.

  He has something to say to you.
}

# Acts 22:19
Then the commander took him by the hand,
went aside and asked privately,
{
  What is it that you have to tell me?
}

# Acts 22:20
And he said,
{
  The Jews have agreed to ask
  that you bring Paul down to the council tomorrow,
  as though they were going to inquire more fully about him.

# Acts 22:21
  But do not yield to them,
  for more than 40 of them lie in wait for him,
  men who have bound themselves by an oath
  that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him;
  and now they are ready,
  waiting for the promise from you.
}

# Acts 22:22
So the commander let the young man depart, and commanded him,
{
  Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me.
}

# Acts 22:23
And he called for two centurions, saying,
{
  Prepare 200 soldiers, 70 horsemen, and 200 spearmen
  to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night;
# Acts 22:24
  and provide mounts to set Paul on,
  and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
}

# Acts 22:25
He wrote a letter in the following manner:
{
# Acts 22:26
  Claudius Lysias,

  To the most excellent governor Felix:

  Greetings.

# Acts 22:27
  This man was seized by the Jews
  and was about to be killed by them.

  Coming with the troops I rescued him,
  having learned that he was a Roman.

# Acts 22:28
  And when I wanted to know the reason they accused him,
  I brought him before their council.

# Acts 22:29
  I found out that he was accused
  concerning questions of their law,
  but had nothing charged against him
  deserving of death or chains.

# Acts 22:30
  And when it was told me that the Jews lay in wait for the man,
  I sent him immediately to you,
  and also commanded his accusers
  to state before you
  the charges against him.

  Farewell.
}

# Acts 22:31
Then the soldiers, as they were commanded,
took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.

# Acts 22:32
The next day they left the horsemen to go on with him,
and returned to the barracks.

# Acts 22:33
When they came to Caesarea
and had delivered the letter to the governor,
they also presented Paul to him.

# Acts 22:34
And when the governor had read it,
he asked what province he was from.

And when he understood that he was from Cilicia,
# Acts 22:35
he said,
{
  I will hear you when your accusers also have come.
}

And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's Praetorium.

# Acts 23:1
Now after five days
Ananias the high priest came down with the elders
and a certain orator named Tertullus.

These gave evidence to the governor against Paul.

# Acts 23:2
And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation,
saying:
{
  Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace,
  and prosperity is being brought to this nation
  by your foresight,
# Acts 23:3
  we accept it always and in all places, most noble Felix,
  with all thankfulness.

# Acts 23:4
  Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further,
  I beg you to hear, by your courtesy, a few words from us.

# Acts 23:5
  For we have found this man a plague,
  a creator of dissension among all the Jews throughout the world,
  and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.

# Acts 23:6
  He even tried to profane the temple,
  and we seized him,
  and wanted to judge him according to our law.

# Acts 23:7
  But the commander Lysias came by
  and with great violence took him out of our hands,
# Acts 23:8
  commanding his accusers to come to you.

  By examining him yourself
  you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.
}

# Acts 23:9
And the Jews also assented,
maintaining that these things were so.

# Acts 23:10
Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak,
answered:
{
  Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years
  a judge of this nation,
  I do the more cheerfully answer for myself,
# Acts 23:11
  because you may ascertain that it is no more than 12 days
  since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.

# Acts 23:12
  And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone
  nor inciting the crowd,
  either in the synagogues or in the city.

# Acts 23:13
  Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.

# Acts 23:14
  But this I confess to you,
  that according to the Way which they call a sect,
  so I worship the God of my fathers,
  believing all things
  which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.

# Acts 23:15
  I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept,
  that there will be a resurrection of the dead,
  both of the just and the unjust.

# Acts 23:16
  This being so,
  I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense
  toward God and men.

# Acts 23:17
  Now after many years
  I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation,
# Acts 23:18
  in the midst of which some Jews from Asia
  found me purified in the temple,
  neither with a mob nor with tumult.

# Acts 23:19
  They ought to have been here before you
  to object if they had anything against me.

# Acts 23:20
  Or else let those who are here themselves
  say if they found any wrongdoing in me
  while I stood before the council,
# Acts 23:21
  unless it is for this one statement which I cried out,
  standing among them,
  {
    Concerning the resurrection of the dead
    I am being judged by you this day.
  }
}

# Acts 23:22
But when Felix heard these things,
having more accurate knowledge of the Way,
he adjourned the proceedings and said,
{
  When Lysias the commander comes down,
  I will make a decision on your case.
}

# Acts 23:23
So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul
and to let him have liberty,
and told him not to forbid any of his friends
to provide for or visit him.

# Acts 23:24
And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
who was Jewish,
he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.

# Acts 23:25
Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control,
and the judgment to come,
Felix was afraid and answered,
{
  Go away for now;
  when I have a convenient time I will call for you.
}

# Acts 23:26
Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul,
that he might release him.

Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.

# Acts 23:27
But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix;
and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.

# Acts 24:1
Now when Festus had come to the province,
after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

# Acts 24:2
Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews
informed him against Paul;
and they petitioned him,
# Acts 24:3
asking a favor against him,
that he would summon him to Jerusalem --
while they lay in ambush
along the road
to kill him.

# Acts 24:4
But Festus answered
that Paul should be kept at Caesarea,
and that he himself was going there shortly.

{
# Acts 24:5
  Therefore,
}
he said,
{
  let those who have authority among you
  go down with me and accuse this man,
  to see if there is any fault in him.
}

# Acts 24:6
And when he had remained among them more than 10 days,
he went down to Caesarea.

And the next day,
sitting on the judgment seat,
he commanded Paul to be brought.

# Acts 24:7
When he had come,
the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood about
and laid many serious complaints against Paul,
which they could not prove,
# Acts 24:8
while he answered for himself,
{
  Neither against the law of the Jews,
  nor against the temple,
  nor against Caesar have I offended in anything at all.
}

# Acts 24:9
But Festus,
wanting to do the Jews a favor,
answered Paul and said,
{
  Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem
  and there be judged before me
  concerning these things?
}

# Acts 24:10
So Paul said,
{
  I stand at Caesar's judgment seat,
  where I ought to be judged.

  To the Jews I have done no wrong,
  as you very well know.

# Acts 24:11
  For if I am an offender,
  or have committed anything deserving of death,
  I do not object to dying;
  but if there is nothing in these things
  of which these men accuse me,
  no one can deliver me to them.

  I appeal to Caesar.
}

# Acts 24:12
Then Festus,
when he had conferred with the council,
answered,
{
  You have appealed to Caesar?

  To Caesar you shall go!
}

# Acts 24:13
And after some days
King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea
to greet Festus.

# Acts 24:14
When they had been there many days,
Festus laid Paul's case before the king,
saying:
{
  There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix,
# Acts 24:15
  about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews
  informed me,
  when I was in Jerusalem,
  asking for a judgment against him.

# Acts 24:16
  To them I answered,
  {
    It is not the custom of the Romans
    to deliver any man to destruction
    before the accused meets the accusers face to face,
    and has opportunity to answer for himself
    concerning the charge against him.
  }

# Acts 24:17
  Therefore when they had come together,
  without any delay,
  the next day
  I sat on the judgment seat
  and commanded the man to be brought in.

# Acts 24:18
  When the accusers stood up,
  they brought no accusation against him
  of such things as I supposed,
# Acts 24:19
  but had some questions against him
  about their own religion and about a certain Jesus,
  who had died,
  whom Paul affirmed to be alive.

# Acts 24:20
  And because I was uncertain of such questions,
  I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem
  and there be judged concerning these matters.

# Acts 24:21
  But when Paul appealed
  to be reserved for the decision of Augustus,
  I commanded him to be kept
  till I could send him to Caesar.
}

# Acts 24:22
Then Agrippa said to Festus,
{
  I also would like to hear the man myself.
}

{
  Tomorrow,
}
he said,
{
  you shall hear him.
}

# Acts 24:23
So the next day,
when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp,
and had entered the auditorium
with the commanders and the prominent men of the city,
at Festus' command Paul was brought in.

# Acts 24:24
And Festus said:
{
  King Agrippa and all the men who are here present with us,
  you see this man
  about whom the whole assembly of the Jews petitioned me,
  both at Jerusalem and here,
  crying out that he was not fit to live any longer.

# Acts 24:25
  But when I found
  that he had committed nothing deserving of death,
  and that he himself had appealed to Augustus,
  I decided to send him.

# Acts 24:26
  I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him.

  Therefore I have brought him out before you,
  and especially before you, King Agrippa,
  so that after the examination has taken place
  I may have something to write.

# Acts 24:27
  For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner
  and not to specify the charges against him.
}

# Acts 25:1
Then Agrippa said to Paul,
{
  You are permitted to speak for yourself.
}

So Paul stretched out his hand
and answered for himself:
{
# Acts 25:2
  I think myself happy, King Agrippa,
  because today I shall answer for myself
  before you concerning all the things
  of which I am accused by the Jews,
# Acts 25:3
  especially because you are expert
  in all customs and questions
  which have to do with the Jews.

  Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.

# Acts 25:4
  My manner of life from my youth,
  which was spent from the beginning
  among my own nation at Jerusalem,
  all the Jews know.

# Acts 25:5
  They knew me from the first,
  if they were willing to testify,
  that according to the strictest sect of our religion
  I lived a Pharisee.

# Acts 25:6
  And now I stand and am judged
  for the hope of the promise
  made by God to our fathers.

# Acts 25:7
  To this promise our twelve tribes,
  earnestly serving God night and day,
  hope to attain.

  For this hope's sake, King Agrippa,
  I am accused by the Jews.

# Acts 25:8
  Why should it be thought incredible by you
  that God raises the dead?

# Acts 25:9
  Indeed,
  I myself thought I must do many things
  contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.

# Acts 25:10
  This I also did in Jerusalem,
  and many of the saints I shut up in prison,
  having received authority from the chief priests;
  and when they were put to death,
  I cast my vote against them.

# Acts 25:11
  And I punished them often in every synagogue
  and compelled them to blaspheme;
  and being exceedingly enraged against them,
  I persecuted them even to foreign cities.

# Acts 25:12
  While thus occupied,
  as I journeyed to Damascus
  with authority and commission from the chief priests,
# Acts 25:13
  at midday, O king,
  along the road I saw a light from heaven,
  brighter than the sun,
  shining around me and those who journeyed with me.

# Acts 25:14
  And when we all had fallen to the ground,
  I heard a voice speaking to me
  and saying in the Hebrew language,
  {
    Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?

    It is hard for you to kick against the goads.
  }

# Acts 25:15
  So I said,
  {
    Who are You, Lord?
  }

  And He said,
  {
    I am Jesus,
    whom you are persecuting.

# Acts 25:16
    But rise and stand on your feet;
    for I have appeared to you for this purpose,
    to make you a minister and a witness
    both of the things which you have seen
    and of the things which I will yet reveal to you.

    I will deliver you from the Jewish people,
    as well as from the Gentiles,
    to whom I now send you,
# Acts 25:17
    to open their eyes,
    in order to turn them from darkness to light,
    and from the power of Satan to God,
    that they may receive forgiveness of sins
    and an inheritance among those who are sanctified
    by faith in Me.
  }

# Acts 25:18
  Therefore, King Agrippa,
  I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
# Acts 25:19
  but declared first
  to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem,
  and throughout all the region of Judea,
  and then to the Gentiles,
  that they should repent,
  turn to God,
  and do works befitting repentance.

# Acts 25:20
  For these reasons
  the Jews seized me in the temple
  and tried to kill me.

# Acts 25:21
  Therefore,
  having obtained help from God,
  to this day I stand,
  witnessing both to small and great,
  saying no other things
  than those which the prophets and Moses said would come --
# Acts 25:22
  that the Christ would suffer,
  that He would be the first to rise from the dead,
  and would proclaim light
  to the Jewish people
  and to the Gentiles.
}

# Acts 25:23
Now as he thus made his defense,
Festus said with a loud voice,
{
  Paul, you are beside yourself!

  Much learning is driving you mad!
}

# Acts 25:24
But he said,
{
  I am not mad,
  most noble Festus,
  but speak the words of truth and reason.

# Acts 25:25
  For the king,
  before whom I also speak freely,
  knows these things;
  for I am convinced
  that none of these things escapes his attention,
  since this thing was not done in a corner.

# Acts 25:26
  King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets?

  I know that you do believe.
}

# Acts 25:27
Then Agrippa said to Paul,
{
  You almost persuade me
  to become a Christian.
}

# Acts 25:28
And Paul said,
{
  I would to God that not only you,
  but also all who hear me today,
  might become both almost and altogether such as I am,
  except for these chains.
}

# Acts 25:29
When he had said these things,
the king stood up,
as well as the governor and Bernice
and those who sat with them;
# Acts 25:30
and when they had gone aside,
they talked among themselves, saying,
{
  This man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains.
}

# Acts 25:31
Then Agrippa said to Festus,
{
  This man might have been set free
  if he had not appealed to Caesar.
}

# Acts 26:1
And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy,
they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to one named Julius,
a centurion of the Augustan Regiment.

# Acts 26:2
So, entering a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea,
meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia.

Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.

# Acts 26:3
And the next day we landed at Sidon.

And Julius treated Paul kindly
and gave him liberty to go to his friends and receive care.

# Acts 26:4
When we had put to sea from there,
we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus,
because the winds were contrary.

# Acts 26:5
And when we had sailed over the sea
which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia,
we came to Myra,
a city of Lycia.

# Acts 26:6
There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy,
and he put us on board.

# Acts 26:7
When we had sailed slowly many days,
and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus,
the wind not permitting us to proceed,
we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone.

# Acts 26:8
Passing it with difficulty,
we came to a place called Fair Havens,
near the city of Lasea.

# Acts 26:9
Now when much time had been spent,
and sailing was now dangerous
because the Fast was already over,
Paul advised them,
# Acts 26:10
saying,
{
  Men, I perceive
  that this voyage will end with disaster and much loss,
  not only of the cargo and ship,
  but also our lives.
}

# Acts 26:11
Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded
by the helmsman and the owner of the ship
than by the things spoken by Paul.

# Acts 26:12
And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in,
the majority advised to set sail from there also,
if by any means they could reach Phoenix,
a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest,
and winter there.

# Acts 26:13
When the south wind blew softly,
supposing that they had obtained their desire,
putting out to sea,
they sailed close by Crete.

# Acts 26:14
But not long after,
a tempestuous head wind arose,
called Euroclydon.

# Acts 26:15
So when the ship was caught,
and could not head into the wind,
we let her drive.

# Acts 26:16
And running under the shelter of an island called Clauda,
we secured the skiff with difficulty.

# Acts 26:17
When they had taken it on board,
they used cables to undergird the ship;
and fearing lest they should run aground on the Syrtis Sands,
they struck sail and so were driven.

# Acts 26:18
And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed,
the next day they lightened the ship.

# Acts 26:19
On the third day
we threw the ship's tackle overboard with our own hands.

# Acts 26:20
Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days,
and no small tempest beat on us,
all hope that we would be saved was finally given up.

# Acts 26:21
But after long abstinence from food,
then Paul stood in the midst of them and said,
{
  Men, you should have listened to me,
  and not have sailed from Crete
  and incurred this disaster and loss.

# Acts 26:22
  And now I urge you to take heart,
  for there will be no loss of life among you,
  but only of the ship.

# Acts 26:23
  For there stood by me this night an angel of the God
  to whom I belong and whom I serve,
# Acts 26:24
  saying,
  {
    Do not be afraid, Paul;
    you must be brought before Caesar;
    and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.
  }

# Acts 26:25
  Therefore take heart, men,
  for I believe God
  that it will be just as it was told me.

# Acts 26:26
  However, we must run aground on a certain island.
}

# Acts 26:27
Now when the fourteenth night had come,
as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea,
about midnight the sailors sensed
that they were drawing near some land.

# Acts 26:28
And they took soundings and found it to be 20 fathoms;
and when they had gone a little farther,
they took soundings again and found it to be 15 fathoms.

# Acts 26:29
Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks,
they dropped four anchors from the stern,
and prayed for day to come.

# Acts 26:30
And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship,
when they had let down the skiff into the sea,
under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow,
# Acts 26:31
Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers,
{
  Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.
}

# Acts 26:32
Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff
and let it fall off.

# Acts 26:33
And as day was about to dawn,
Paul implored them all to take food, saying,
{
  Today is the fourteenth day
  you have waited and continued without food,
  and eaten nothing.

# Acts 26:34
  Therefore I urge you to take nourishment,
  for this is for your survival,
  since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.
}

# Acts 26:35
And when he had said these things,
he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all;
and when he had broken it he began to eat.

# Acts 26:36
Then they were all encouraged,
and also took food themselves.

# Acts 26:37
And in all we were 267 persons on the ship.

# Acts 26:38
So when they had eaten enough,
they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea.

# Acts 26:39
When it was day,
they did not recognize the land;
but they observed a bay with a beach,
onto which they planned to run the ship if possible.

# Acts 26:40
And they let go the anchors and left them in the sea,
meanwhile loosing the rudder ropes;
and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind
and made for shore.

# Acts 26:41
But striking a place where two seas met,
they ran the ship aground;
and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable,
but the stern was being broken up
by the violence of the waves.

# Acts 26:42
And the soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners,
lest any of them should swim away and escape.

# Acts 26:43
But the centurion,
wanting to save Paul,
kept them from their purpose,
and commanded that those who could swim
should jump overboard first
and get to land,
# Acts 26:44
and the rest,
some on boards and some on parts of the ship.

And so it was that they all escaped safely to land.

# Acts 27:1
Now when they had escaped,
they then found out that the island was called Malta.

# Acts 27:2
And the natives showed us unusual kindness;
for they kindled a fire and made us all welcome,
because of the rain that was falling
and because of the cold.

# Acts 27:3
But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks
and laid them on the fire,
a viper came out because of the heat,
and fastened on his hand.

# Acts 27:4
So when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand,
they said to one another,
{
  No doubt this man is a murderer,
  whom, though he has escaped the sea,
  yet justice does not allow to live.
}

# Acts 27:5
But he shook off the creature into the fire
and suffered no harm.

# Acts 27:6
However,
they were expecting that he would swell up
or suddenly fall down dead.

But after they had looked for a long time
and saw no harm come to him,
they changed their minds and said that he was a god.

# Acts 27:7
In that region
there was an estate of the leading citizen of the island,
whose name was Publius,
who received us
and entertained us courteously for three days.

# Acts 27:8
And it happened that the father of Publius
lay sick of a fever and dysentery.

Paul went in to him and prayed,
and he laid his hands on him and healed him.

# Acts 27:9
So when this was done,
the rest of those on the island
who had diseases also came and were healed.

# Acts 27:10
They also honored us in many ways;
and when we departed,
they provided such things as were necessary.

# Acts 27:11
After three months we sailed in an Alexandrian ship
whose figurehead was the Twin Brothers,
which had wintered at the island.

# Acts 27:12
And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.

# Acts 27:13
From there we circled round and reached Rhegium.

And after one day the south wind blew;
and the next day we came to Puteoli,
# Acts 27:14
where we found brethren,
and were invited to stay with them seven days.

And so we went toward Rome.

# Acts 27:15
And from there, when the brethren heard about us,
they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns.

When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.

# Acts 27:16
Now when we came to Rome,
the centurion delivered the prisoners
to the captain of the guard;
but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself
with the soldier who guarded him.

# Acts 27:17
And it came to pass after three days
that Paul called the leaders of the Jews together.

So when they had come together, he said to them:
{
  Men and brethren,
  though I have done nothing
  against our people or the customs of our fathers,
  yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem
  into the hands of the Romans,
# Acts 27:18
  who, when they had examined me, wanted to let me go,
  because there was no cause for putting me to death.

# Acts 27:19
  But when the Jews spoke against it,
  I was compelled to appeal to Caesar,
  not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation.

# Acts 27:20
  For this reason therefore I have called for you,
  to see you and speak with you,
  because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
}

# Acts 27:21
Then they said to him,
{
  We neither received letters from Judea concerning you,
  nor have any of the brethren who came
  reported or spoken any evil of you.

  But we desire to hear from you what you think;
  for concerning this sect,
  we know that it is spoken against everywhere.
}

# Acts 27:22
So when they had appointed him a day,
many came to him at his lodging,
to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God,
persuading them concerning Jesus
from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets,
from morning till evening.

# Acts 27:23
And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken,
and some disbelieved.

# Acts 27:24
So when they did not agree among themselves,
they departed after Paul had said one word:
{
  The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet
  to our fathers,
# Acts 27:25
  saying,
  {
    Go to this people and say:
    {
      Hearing you will hear, and shall not understand;
      And seeing you will see, and not perceive;

# Acts 27:26
      For the hearts of this people have grown dull.

      Their ears are hard of hearing,
      And their eyes they have closed,
      Lest they should see with their eyes
        and hear with their ears,
      Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn,
      So that I should heal them.
    }
  }

# Acts 27:27
  Therefore let it be known to you
  that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles,
  and they will hear it!
}

# Acts 27:28
And when he had said these words,
the Jews departed and had a great dispute among themselves.

# Acts 27:29
Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house,
and received all who came to him,
# Acts 27:30
preaching the kingdom of God
and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ
with all confidence,
no one forbidding him.
