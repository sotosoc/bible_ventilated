# Daniel 1:1
In the third year
of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah,
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
came to Jerusalem and besieged it.

# Daniel 1:2
And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah
into his hand,
with some of the articles of the house of God,
which he carried into the land of Shinar
to the house of his god;
and he brought the articles
into the treasure house of his god.

# Daniel 1:3
Then the king instructed Ashpenaz,
the master of his eunuchs,
to bring some of the children of Israel
and some of the king's descendants
and some of the nobles,
# Daniel 1:4
young men in whom there was no blemish,
but good-looking,
gifted in all wisdom,
possessing knowledge and quick to understand,
who had ability to serve in the king's palace,
and whom they might teach
the language and literature of the Chaldeans.

# Daniel 1:5
And the king appointed for them
a daily provision of the king's delicacies
and of the wine which he drank,
and three years of training for them,
so that at the end of that time
they might serve before the king.

# Daniel 1:6
Now from among those of the sons of Judah
were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.

# Daniel 1:7
To them the chief of the eunuchs gave names:
he gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar;
to Hananiah, Shadrach;
to Mishael, Meshach;
and to Azariah, Abed-Nego.

# Daniel 1:8
But Daniel purposed in his heart
that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's delicacies,
nor with the wine which he drank;
therefore he requested of the chief of the eunuchs
that he might not defile himself.

# Daniel 1:9
Now God had brought Daniel into the favor and goodwill
of the chief of the eunuchs.

# Daniel 1:10
And the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel,
{
  I fear my lord the king,
  who has appointed your food and drink.

  For why should he see your faces looking worse
  than the young men who are your age?

  Then you would endanger my head before the king.
}

# Daniel 1:11
So Daniel said to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs had set
over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
{
# Daniel 1:12
  Please test your servants for 10 days,
  and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.

# Daniel 1:13
  Then let our appearance be examined before you,
  and the appearance of the young men
  who eat the portion of the king's delicacies;
  and as you see fit,
  so deal with your servants.
}

# Daniel 1:14
So he consented with them in this matter,
and tested them 10 days.

# Daniel 1:15
And at the end of 10 days
their features appeared better and fatter in flesh
than all the young men
who ate the portion
of the king's delicacies.

# Daniel 1:16
Thus the steward took away their portion of delicacies
and the wine that they were to drink,
and gave them vegetables.

# Daniel 1:17
As for these four young men,
God gave them knowledge and skill in all literature and wisdom;
and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.

# Daniel 1:18
Now at the end of the days,
when the king had said that they should be brought in,
the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.

# Daniel 1:19
Then the king interviewed them,
and among them all none was found like
Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah;
therefore they served before the king.

# Daniel 1:20
And in all matters of wisdom and understanding
about which the king examined them,
he found them 10 times better than all the magicians and astrologers
who were in all his realm.

# Daniel 1:21
Thus Daniel continued until the first year of King Cyrus.

# Daniel 2:1
Now in the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign,
Nebuchadnezzar had dreams;
and his spirit was so troubled that his sleep left him.

# Daniel 2:2
Then the king gave the command to call the magicians,
the astrologers,
the sorcerers,
and the Chaldeans to tell the king his dreams.

So they came and stood before the king.

# Daniel 2:3
And the king said to them,
{
  I have had a dream,
  and my spirit is anxious to know the dream.
}

# Daniel 2:4
Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Aramaic,
{
  O king, live forever!

  Tell your servants the dream,
  and we will give the interpretation.
}

# Daniel 2:5
The king answered and said to the Chaldeans,
{
  My decision is firm:
  if you do not make known the dream to me,
  and its interpretation,
  you shall be cut in pieces,
  and your houses shall be made an ash heap.

# Daniel 2:6
  However, if you tell the dream and its interpretation,
  you shall receive from me gifts, rewards, and great honor.

  Therefore tell me the dream and its interpretation.
}

# Daniel 2:7
They answered again and said,
{
  Let the king tell his servants the dream,
  and we will give its interpretation.
}

# Daniel 2:8
The king answered and said,
{
  I know for certain that you would gain time,
  because you see that my decision is firm:
# Daniel 2:9
  if you do not make known the dream to me,
  there is only one decree for you!

  For you have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me
  till the time has changed.

  Therefore tell me the dream,
  and I shall know that you can give me its interpretation.
}

# Daniel 2:10
The Chaldeans answered the king, and said,
{
  There is not a man on earth who can tell the king's matter;
  therefore no king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such things
  of any magician, astrologer, or Chaldean.

# Daniel 2:11
  It is a difficult thing that the king requests,
  and there is no other who can tell it to the king except the gods,
  whose dwelling is not with flesh.
}

# Daniel 2:12
For this reason the king was angry and very furious,
and gave a command to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

# Daniel 2:13
So the decree went out, and they began killing the wise men;
and they sought Daniel and his companions, to kill them.

# Daniel 2:14
Then with counsel and wisdom Daniel answered Arioch,
the captain of the king's guard,
who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon;
# Daniel 2:15
he answered and said to Arioch the king's captain,
{
  Why is the decree from the king so urgent?
}

Then Arioch made the decision known to Daniel.

# Daniel 2:16
So Daniel went in and asked the king to give him time,
that he might tell the king the interpretation.

# Daniel 2:17
Then Daniel went to his house,
and made the decision known
to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
his companions,
# Daniel 2:18
that they might seek mercies from the God of heaven
concerning this secret,
so that Daniel and his companions might not perish
with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

# Daniel 2:19
Then the secret was revealed to Daniel
in a night vision.

So Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

# Daniel 2:20
Daniel answered and said:
{
  Blessed be the name of God forever and ever,
  For wisdom and might are His.

# Daniel 2:21
  And He changes the times and the seasons;
  He removes kings and raises up kings;
  He gives wisdom to the wise
  And knowledge to those who have understanding.

# Daniel 2:22
  He reveals deep and secret things;
  He knows what is in the darkness,
  And light dwells with Him.

# Daniel 2:23
  I thank You and praise You, O God of my fathers;
  You have given me wisdom and might,
  And have now made known to me what we asked of You,
  For You have made known to us the king's demand.
}

# Daniel 2:24
Therefore Daniel went to Arioch,
whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon.

He went and said thus to him:
{
  Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon;
  take me before the king,
  and I will tell the king the interpretation.
}

# Daniel 2:25
Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king,
and said thus to him,
{
  I have found a man of the captives of Judah,
  who will make known to the king the interpretation.
}

# Daniel 2:26
The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,
{
  Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen,
  and its interpretation?
}

# Daniel 2:27
Daniel answered in the presence of the king,
and said,
{
  The secret which the king has demanded,
  the wise men,
  the astrologers,
  the magicians,
  and the soothsayers cannot declare to the king.

# Daniel 2:28
  But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets,
  and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar
  what will be in the latter days.

  Your dream,
  and the visions of your head upon your bed,
  were these:

# Daniel 2:29
  As for you, O king,
  thoughts came to your mind while on your bed,
  about what would come to pass after this;
  and He who reveals secrets
  has made known to you what will be.

# Daniel 2:30
  But as for me,
  this secret has not been revealed to me
  because I have more wisdom than anyone living,
  but for our sakes
  who make known the interpretation to the king,
  and that you may know the thoughts of your heart.

# Daniel 2:31
  You, O king, were watching;
  and behold, a great image!

  This great image,
  whose splendor was excellent,
  stood before you;
  and its form was awesome.

# Daniel 2:32
  This image's head was of fine gold,
  its chest and arms of silver,
  its belly and thighs of bronze,
# Daniel 2:33
  its legs of iron,
  its feet partly of iron and partly of clay.

# Daniel 2:34
  You watched while a stone was cut out without hands,
  which struck the image on its feet of iron and clay,
  and broke them in pieces.

# Daniel 2:35
  Then the iron,
  the clay,
  the bronze,
  the silver,
  and the gold were crushed together,
  and became like chaff
  from the summer threshing floors;
  the wind carried them away
  so that no trace of them was found.

  And the stone that struck the image
  became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.

# Daniel 2:36
  This is the dream.

  Now we will tell the interpretation of it
  before the king.

# Daniel 2:37
  You, O king, are a king of kings.

  For the God of heaven has given you a kingdom,
  power, strength, and glory;
# Daniel 2:38
  and wherever the children of men dwell,
  or the beasts of the field and the birds of the heaven,
  He has given them into your hand,
  and has made you ruler over them all --
  you are this head of gold.

# Daniel 2:39
  But after you shall arise another kingdom
  inferior to yours;
  then another, a third kingdom of bronze,
  which shall rule over all the earth.

# Daniel 2:40
  And the fourth kingdom shall be as strong as iron,
  inasmuch as iron breaks in pieces
  and shatters everything;
  and like iron that crushes,
  that kingdom will break in pieces
  and crush all the others.

# Daniel 2:41
  Whereas you saw the feet and toes,
  partly of potter's clay and partly of iron,
  the kingdom shall be divided;
  yet the strength of the iron shall be in it,
  just as you saw the iron mixed with ceramic clay.

# Daniel 2:42
  And as the toes of the feet
  were partly of iron and partly of clay,
  so the kingdom
  shall be partly strong and partly fragile.

# Daniel 2:43
  As you saw iron mixed with ceramic clay,
  they will mingle with the seed of men;
  but they will not adhere to one another,
  just as iron does not mix with clay.

# Daniel 2:44
  And in the days of these kings
  the God of heaven will set up a kingdom
  which shall never be destroyed;
  and the kingdom shall not be left to other people;
  it shall break in pieces
  and consume all these kingdoms,
  and it shall stand forever.

# Daniel 2:45
  Inasmuch as you saw that the stone
  was cut out of the mountain without hands,
  and that it broke in pieces the iron,
  the bronze,
  the clay,
  the silver,
  and the gold --
  the great God has made known to the king
  what will come to pass after this.

  The dream is certain,
  and its interpretation is sure.
}

# Daniel 2:46
Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face,
prostrate before Daniel,
and commanded that they should present
an offering and incense to him.

# Daniel 2:47
The king answered Daniel, and said,
{
  Truly your God is the God of gods,
  the Lord of kings,
  and a revealer of secrets,
  since you could reveal this secret.
}

# Daniel 2:48
Then the king promoted Daniel
and gave him many great gifts;
and he made him ruler
over the whole province of Babylon,
and chief administrator
over all the wise men of Babylon.

# Daniel 2:49
Also Daniel petitioned the king,
and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego
over the affairs of the province of Babylon;
but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

# Daniel 3:1
Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold,
whose height was 60 cubits and its width six cubits.

He set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

# Daniel 3:2
And King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to gather together the satraps,
the administrators,
the governors,
the counselors,
the treasurers,
the judges,
the magistrates,
and all the officials of the provinces,
to come to the dedication of the image
which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

# Daniel 3:3
So the satraps,
the administrators,
the governors,
the counselors,
the treasurers,
the judges,
the magistrates,
and all the officials of the provinces gathered together
for the dedication of the image
that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up;
and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

# Daniel 3:4
Then a herald cried aloud:
{
  To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages,
# Daniel 3:5
  that at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre,
  and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music,
  you shall fall down and worship the gold image
  that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up;
# Daniel 3:6
  and whoever does not fall down and worship
  shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
}

# Daniel 3:7
So at that time,
when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, and lyre,
in symphony with all kinds of music,
all the people, nations, and languages fell down
and worshiped the gold image which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

# Daniel 3:8
Therefore at that time
certain Chaldeans came forward and accused the Jews.

# Daniel 3:9
They spoke and said to King Nebuchadnezzar,
{
  O king, live forever!

# Daniel 3:10
  You, O king, have made a decree
  that everyone who hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre,
  and psaltery, in symphony with all kinds of music,
  shall fall down and worship the gold image;
# Daniel 3:11
  and whoever does not fall down and worship
  shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

# Daniel 3:12
  There are certain Jews
  whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon:
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego;
  these men, O king, have not paid due regard to you.

  They do not serve your gods or worship the gold image
  which you have set up.
}

# Daniel 3:13
Then Nebuchadnezzar, in rage and fury,
gave the command to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego.

So they brought these men before the king.

# Daniel 3:14
Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying to them,
{
  Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego,
  that you do not serve my gods
  or worship the gold image which I have set up?

# Daniel 3:15
  Now if you are ready at the time
  you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, lyre, and psaltery,
  in symphony with all kinds of music,
  and you fall down and worship the image which I have made,
  good!

  But if you do not worship,
  you shall be cast immediately
  into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

  And who is the god who will deliver you from my hands?
}

# Daniel 3:16
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king,
{
  O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.

# Daniel 3:17
  If that is the case,
  our God whom we serve is able to deliver us
  from the burning fiery furnace,
  and He will deliver us from your hand, O king.

# Daniel 3:18
  But if not, let it be known to you, O king,
  that we do not serve your gods,
  nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.
}

# Daniel 3:19
Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury,
and the expression on his face changed
toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego.

He spoke and commanded
that they heat the furnace seven times more than it was usually heated.

# Daniel 3:20
And he commanded certain mighty men of valor who were in his army
to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego,
and cast them into the burning fiery furnace.

# Daniel 3:21
Then these men were bound in their coats,
their trousers,
their turbans,
and their other garments,
and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

# Daniel 3:22
Therefore, because the king's command was urgent,
and the furnace exceedingly hot,
the flame of the fire killed those men
who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego.

# Daniel 3:23
And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego,
fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

# Daniel 3:24
Then King Nebuchadnezzar was astonished;
and he rose in haste and spoke, saying to his counselors,
{
  Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?
}

They answered and said to the king,
{
  True, O king.
}

{
# Daniel 3:25
  Look!
}
he answered,
{
  I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire;
  and they are not hurt,
  and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
}

# Daniel 3:26
Then Nebuchadnezzar went near the mouth of the burning fiery furnace
and spoke, saying,
{
  Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego,
  servants of the Most High God,
  come out, and come here.
}

Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego came from the midst of the fire.

# Daniel 3:27
And the satraps,
administrators,
governors,
and the king's counselors gathered together,
and they saw these men on whose bodies the fire had no power;
the hair of their head was not singed
nor were their garments affected,
and the smell of fire was not on them.

# Daniel 3:28
Nebuchadnezzar spoke, saying,
{
  Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego,
  who sent His Angel and delivered His servants who trusted in Him,
  and they have frustrated the king's word,
  and yielded their bodies,
  that they should not serve nor worship any god except their own God!

# Daniel 3:29
  Therefore I make a decree that any people, nation, or language
  which speaks anything amiss
  against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego
  shall be cut in pieces,
  and their houses shall be made an ash heap;
  because there is no other God who can deliver like this.
}

# Daniel 3:30
Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego
in the province of Babylon.

# Daniel 4:1
Nebuchadnezzar the king,

  To all peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth:
  Peace be multiplied to you.

  I thought it good to declare the signs and wonders
  that the Most High God has worked for me.

# Daniel 4:2
  How great are His signs,
  And how mighty His wonders!

  His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
  And His dominion is from generation to generation.

# Daniel 4:3
I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house,
and flourishing in my palace.

# Daniel 4:4
I saw a dream which made me afraid,
and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.

# Daniel 4:5
Therefore I issued a decree
to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me,
that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.

# Daniel 4:6
Then the magicians,
the astrologers,
the Chaldeans,
and the soothsayers came in,
and I told them the dream;
but they did not make known to me its interpretation.

# Daniel 4:7
But at last Daniel came before me
(his name is Belteshazzar,
according to the name of my god;
in him is the Spirit of the Holy God),
and I told the dream before him, saying:
{
# Daniel 4:8
  Belteshazzar, chief of the magicians,
  because I know
  that the Spirit of the Holy God is in you,
  and no secret troubles you,
  explain to me the visions of my dream
  that I have seen,
  and its interpretation.

  These were the visions of my head while on my bed:
  {
    I was looking, and behold,
    A tree in the midst of the earth,
    And its height was great.

# Daniel 4:9
    The tree grew and became strong;
    Its height reached to the heavens,
    And it could be seen to the ends of all the earth.

# Daniel 4:10
    Its leaves were lovely,
    Its fruit abundant,
    And in it was food for all.

    The beasts of the field found shade under it,
    The birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches,
    And all flesh was fed from it.
  }

# Daniel 4:11
  I saw in the visions of my head while on my bed,
  and there was a watcher, a holy one,
  coming down from heaven.

# Daniel 4:12
  He cried aloud and said thus:
  {
    Chop down the tree and cut off its branches,
    Strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.

    Let the beasts get out from under it,
    And the birds from its branches.

# Daniel 4:13
    Nevertheless leave the stump and roots in the earth,
    Bound with a band of iron and bronze,
    In the tender grass of the field.

    Let it be wet with the dew of heaven,
    And let him graze with the beasts
    On the grass of the earth.

# Daniel 4:14
    Let his heart be changed from that of a man,
    Let him be given the heart of a beast,
    And let seven times pass over him.

# Daniel 4:15
    This decision is by the decree of the watchers,
    And the sentence by the word of the holy ones,
    In order that the living may know
    That the Most High rules in the kingdom of men,
    Gives it to whomever He will,
    And sets over it the lowest of men.
  }

# Daniel 4:16
  This dream I, King Nebuchadnezzar, have seen.

  Now you, Belteshazzar, declare its interpretation,
  since all the wise men of my kingdom
  are not able to make known to me the interpretation;
  but you are able,
  for the Spirit of the Holy God is in you.
}

# Daniel 4:17
Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,
was astonished for a time,
and his thoughts troubled him.

So the king spoke, and said,
{
  Belteshazzar,
  do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble you.
}

Belteshazzar answered and said,
{
  My lord, may the dream concern those who hate you,
  and its interpretation concern your enemies!

# Daniel 4:18
  The tree that you saw,
  which grew and became strong,
  whose height reached to the heavens
  and which could be seen by all the earth,
# Daniel 4:19
  whose leaves were lovely and its fruit abundant,
  in which was food for all,
  under which the beasts of the field dwelt,
  and in whose branches the birds of the heaven had their home --
# Daniel 4:20
  it is you, O king, who have grown and become strong;
  for your greatness has grown and reaches to the heavens,
  and your dominion to the end of the earth.

# Daniel 4:21
  And inasmuch as the king saw a watcher, a holy one,
  coming down from heaven and saying,
  {
    Chop down the tree and destroy it,
    but leave its stump and roots in the earth,
    bound with a band of iron and bronze
    in the tender grass of the field;
    let it be wet with the dew of heaven,
    and let him graze with the beasts of the field,
    till seven times pass over him
  };
# Daniel 4:22
  this is the interpretation, O king,
  and this is the decree of the Most High,
  which has come upon my lord the king:

# Daniel 4:23
  They shall drive you from men,
  your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field,
  and they shall make you eat grass like oxen.

  They shall wet you with the dew of heaven,
  and seven times shall pass over you,
  till you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men,
  and gives it to whomever He chooses.

# Daniel 4:24
  And inasmuch as they gave the command
  to leave the stump and roots of the tree,
  your kingdom shall be assured to you,
  after you come to know that Heaven rules.

# Daniel 4:25
  Therefore, O king, let my advice be acceptable to you;
  break off your sins by being righteous,
  and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor.

  Perhaps there may be a lengthening of your prosperity.
}

# Daniel 4:26
All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar.

# Daniel 4:27
At the end of the 12 months
he was walking about the royal palace of Babylon.

# Daniel 4:28
The king spoke, saying,
{
  Is not this great Babylon,
  that I have built for a royal dwelling by my mighty power
  and for the honor of my majesty?
}

# Daniel 4:29
While the word was still in the king's mouth,
a voice fell from heaven:
{
  King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken:
  the kingdom has departed from you!

# Daniel 4:30
  And they shall drive you from men,
  and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field.

  They shall make you eat grass like oxen;
  and seven times shall pass over you,
  until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men,
  and gives it to whomever He chooses.
}

# Daniel 4:31
That very hour the word was fulfilled concerning Nebuchadnezzar;
he was driven from men and ate grass like oxen;
his body was wet with the dew of heaven
till his hair had grown like eagles' feathers
and his nails like birds' claws.

# Daniel 4:32
And at the end of the time I, Nebuchadnezzar,
lifted my eyes to heaven,
and my understanding returned to me;
and I blessed the Most High
and praised and honored Him who lives forever:
{
  For His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
  And His kingdom is from generation to generation.

# Daniel 4:33
  All the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing;
  He does according to His will in the army of heaven
  And among the inhabitants of the earth.

  No one can restrain His hand
  Or say to Him,
  {
    What have You done?
  }
}

# Daniel 4:34
At the same time my reason returned to me,
and for the glory of my kingdom,
my honor and splendor returned to me.

My counselors and nobles resorted to me,
I was restored to my kingdom,
and excellent majesty was added to me.

# Daniel 4:35
Now I, Nebuchadnezzar,
praise and extol and honor the King of heaven,
all of whose works are truth,
and His ways justice.

And those who walk in pride He is able to put down.

# Daniel 5:1
Belshazzar the king made a great feast for 1000 of his lords,
and drank wine in the presence of the thousand.

# Daniel 5:2
While he tasted the wine,
Belshazzar gave the command to bring the gold and silver vessels
which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple
which had been in Jerusalem,
that the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines
might drink from them.

# Daniel 5:3
Then they brought the gold vessels
that had been taken from the temple of the house of God
which had been in Jerusalem;
and the king and his lords, his wives, and his concubines
drank from them.

# Daniel 5:4
They drank wine, and praised the gods
of gold and silver,
bronze and iron,
wood and stone.

# Daniel 5:5
In the same hour the fingers of a man's hand appeared
and wrote opposite the lampstand
on the plaster of the wall of the king's palace;
and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.

# Daniel 5:6
Then the king's countenance changed,
and his thoughts troubled him,
so that the joints of his hips were loosened
and his knees knocked against each other.

# Daniel 5:7
The king cried aloud
to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers.

The king spoke, saying to the wise men of Babylon,
{
  Whoever reads this writing,
  and tells me its interpretation,
  shall be clothed with purple
  and have a chain of gold around his neck;
  and he shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
}

# Daniel 5:8
Now all the king's wise men came,
but they could not read the writing,
or make known to the king its interpretation.

# Daniel 5:9
Then King Belshazzar was greatly troubled,
his countenance was changed,
and his lords were astonished.

# Daniel 5:10
The queen, because of the words of the king and his lords,
came to the banquet hall.

The queen spoke, saying,
{
  O king, live forever!

  Do not let your thoughts trouble you,
  nor let your countenance change.

# Daniel 5:11
  There is a man in your kingdom
  in whom is the Spirit of the Holy God.

  And in the days of your father,
  light and understanding and wisdom,
  like the wisdom of the gods,
  were found in him;
  and King Nebuchadnezzar your father -- your father the king --
  made him chief of the magicians,
  astrologers,
  Chaldeans,
  and soothsayers.

# Daniel 5:12
  Inasmuch as an excellent spirit,
  knowledge,
  understanding,
  interpreting dreams,
  solving riddles,
  and explaining enigmas were found in this Daniel,
  whom the king named Belteshazzar,
  now let Daniel be called,
  and he will give the interpretation.
}

# Daniel 5:13
Then Daniel was brought in before the king.

The king spoke, and said to Daniel,
{
  Are you that Daniel who is one of the captives from Judah,
  whom my father the king brought from Judah?

# Daniel 5:14
  I have heard of you, that the Spirit of God is in you,
  and that light and understanding
  and excellent wisdom are found in you.

# Daniel 5:15
  Now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me,
  that they should read this writing
  and make known to me its interpretation,
  but they could not give the interpretation of the thing.

# Daniel 5:16
  And I have heard of you,
  that you can give interpretations and explain enigmas.

  Now if you can read the writing
  and make known to me its interpretation,
  you shall be clothed with purple
  and have a chain of gold around your neck,
  and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
}

# Daniel 5:17
Then Daniel answered, and said before the king,
{
  Let your gifts be for yourself,
  and give your rewards to another;
  yet I will read the writing to the king,
  and make known to him the interpretation.

# Daniel 5:18
  O king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father
  a kingdom and majesty,
  glory and honor.

# Daniel 5:19
  And because of the majesty that He gave him,
  all peoples, nations, and languages
  trembled and feared before him.

  Whomever he wished, he executed;
  whomever he wished, he kept alive;
  whomever he wished, he set up;
  and whomever he wished, he put down.

# Daniel 5:20
  But when his heart was lifted up,
  and his spirit was hardened in pride,
  he was deposed from his kingly throne,
  and they took his glory from him.

# Daniel 5:21
  Then he was driven from the sons of men,
  his heart was made like the beasts,
  and his dwelling was with the wild donkeys.

  They fed him with grass like oxen,
  and his body was wet with the dew of heaven,
  till he knew that the Most High God rules in the kingdom of men,
  and appoints over it whomever He chooses.

# Daniel 5:22
  But you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart,
  although you knew all this.

# Daniel 5:23
  And you have lifted yourself up against the Lord of heaven.

  They have brought the vessels of His house before you,
  and you and your lords,
  your wives and your concubines,
  have drunk wine from them.

  And you have praised the gods of silver and gold,
  bronze and iron,
  wood and stone,
  which do not see or hear or know;
  and the God who holds your breath in His hand
  and owns all your ways,
  you have not glorified.

# Daniel 5:24
  Then the fingers of the hand were sent from Him,
  and this writing was written.

# Daniel 5:25
  And this is the inscription that was written:
  MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.

# Daniel 5:26
  This is the interpretation of each word.

  Mene:
  God has numbered your kingdom, and finished it;

# Daniel 5:27
  Tekel:
  You have been weighed in the balances, and found wanting;

# Daniel 5:28
  Peres:
  Your kingdom has been divided,
  and given to the Medes and Persians.
}

# Daniel 5:29
Then Belshazzar gave the command,
and they clothed Daniel with purple
and put a chain of gold around his neck,
and made a proclamation concerning him
that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.

# Daniel 5:30
That very night Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans, was slain.

# Daniel 5:31
And Darius the Mede received the kingdom,
being about 62 years old.

# Daniel 6:1
It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom 120 satraps,
to be over the whole kingdom;
# Daniel 6:2
and over these, three governors, of whom Daniel was one,
that the satraps might give account to them,
so that the king would suffer no loss.

# Daniel 6:3
Then this Daniel distinguished himself
above the governors and satraps,
because an excellent spirit was in him;
and the king gave thought to setting him over the whole realm.

# Daniel 6:4
So the governors and satraps
sought to find some charge against Daniel
concerning the kingdom;
but they could find no charge or fault,
because he was faithful;
nor was there any error or fault found in him.

# Daniel 6:5
Then these men said,
{
  We shall not find any charge against this Daniel
  unless we find it against him concerning the law of his God.
}

# Daniel 6:6
So these governors and satraps thronged before the king,
and said thus to him:
{
  King Darius, live forever!

# Daniel 6:7
  All the governors of the kingdom,
  the administrators and satraps,
  the counselors and advisors,
  have consulted together
  to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree,
  that whoever petitions any god or man for 30 days,
  except you, O king,
  shall be cast into the den of lions.

# Daniel 6:8
  Now, O king, establish the decree and sign the writing,
  so that it cannot be changed,
  according to the law of the Medes and Persians,
  which does not alter.
}

# Daniel 6:9
Therefore King Darius signed the written decree.

# Daniel 6:10
Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed,
he went home.

And in his upper room,
with his windows open toward Jerusalem,
he knelt down on his knees three times that day,
and prayed and gave thanks before his God,
as was his custom since early days.

# Daniel 6:11
Then these men assembled
and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.

# Daniel 6:12
And they went before the king,
and spoke concerning the king's decree:
{
  Have you not signed a decree
  that every man who petitions any god or man within 30 days,
  except you, O king,
  shall be cast into the den of lions?
}

The king answered and said,
{
  The thing is true,
  according to the law of the Medes and Persians,
  which does not alter.
}

# Daniel 6:13
So they answered and said before the king,
{
  That Daniel, who is one of the captives from Judah,
  does not show due regard for you, O king,
  or for the decree that you have signed,
  but makes his petition three times a day.
}

# Daniel 6:14
And the king, when he heard these words,
was greatly displeased with himself,
and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him;
and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him.

# Daniel 6:15
Then these men approached the king,
and said to the king,
{
  Know, O king, that it is the law of the Medes and Persians
  that no decree or statute which the king establishes
  may be changed.
}

# Daniel 6:16
So the king gave the command,
and they brought Daniel and cast him into the den of lions.

But the king spoke, saying to Daniel,
{
  Your God, whom you serve continually,
  He will deliver you.
}

# Daniel 6:17
Then a stone was brought and laid on the mouth of the den,
and the king sealed it with his own signet ring
and with the signets of his lords,
that the purpose concerning Daniel might not be changed.

# Daniel 6:18
Now the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting;
and no musicians were brought before him.

Also his sleep went from him.

# Daniel 6:19
Then the king arose very early in the morning
and went in haste to the den of lions.

# Daniel 6:20
And when he came to the den,
he cried out with a lamenting voice to Daniel.

The king spoke, saying to Daniel,
{
  Daniel, servant of the living God,
  has your God, whom you serve continually,
  been able to deliver you from the lions?
}

# Daniel 6:21
Then Daniel said to the king,
{
  O king, live forever!

# Daniel 6:22
  My God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouths,
  so that they have not hurt me,
  because I was found innocent before Him;
  and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you.
}

# Daniel 6:23
Then the king was exceedingly glad for him,
and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den.

So Daniel was taken up out of the den,
and no injury whatever was found on him,
because he believed in his God.

# Daniel 6:24
And the king gave the command,
and they brought those men who had accused Daniel,
and they cast them into the den of lions --
them,
their children,
and their wives;
and the lions overpowered them,
and broke all their bones in pieces
before they ever came to the bottom of the den.

# Daniel 6:25
Then King Darius wrote:
{
  To all peoples, nations, and languages
  that dwell in all the earth:

  Peace be multiplied to you.

# Daniel 6:26
  I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom
  men must tremble and fear before the God of Daniel.

  For He is the living God,
  And steadfast forever;
  His kingdom is the one which shall not be destroyed,
  And His dominion shall endure to the end.

# Daniel 6:27
  He delivers and rescues,
  And He works signs and wonders
  In heaven and on earth,
  Who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
}

# Daniel 6:28
So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius
and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

# Daniel 7:1
In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon,
Daniel had a dream and visions of his head while on his bed.

Then he wrote down the dream,
telling the main facts.

# Daniel 7:2
Daniel spoke, saying,
{
  I saw in my vision by night,
  and behold,
  the four winds of heaven were stirring up the Great Sea.

# Daniel 7:3
  And four great beasts came up from the sea,
  each different from the other.

# Daniel 7:4
  The first was like a lion,
  and had eagle's wings.

  I watched till its wings were plucked off;
  and it was lifted up from the earth
  and made to stand on two feet like a man,
  and a man's heart was given to it.

# Daniel 7:5
  And suddenly another beast,
  a second, like a bear.

  It was raised up on one side,
  and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth.

  And they said thus to it:
  {
    Arise, devour much flesh!
  }

# Daniel 7:6
  After this I looked, and there was another, like a leopard,
  which had on its back four wings of a bird.

  The beast also had four heads,
  and dominion was given to it.

# Daniel 7:7
  After this I saw in the night visions,
  and behold, a fourth beast,
  dreadful and terrible,
  exceedingly strong.

  It had huge iron teeth;
  it was devouring,
  breaking in pieces,
  and trampling the residue with its feet.

  It was different from all the beasts that were before it,
  and it had 10 horns.

# Daniel 7:8
  I was considering the horns,
  and there was another horn,
  a little one, coming up among them,
  before whom three of the first horns
  were plucked out by the roots.

  And there, in this horn,
  were eyes like the eyes of a man,
  and a mouth speaking pompous words.

# Daniel 7:9
  I watched till thrones were put in place,
  And the Ancient of Days was seated;
  His garment was white as snow,
  And the hair of His head was like pure wool.

  His throne was a fiery flame,
  Its wheels a burning fire;
# Daniel 7:10
  A fiery stream issued
  And came forth from before Him.

  A thousand thousands ministered to Him;
  10,000 times 10,000 stood before Him.

  The court was seated,
  And the books were opened.

# Daniel 7:11
  I watched then because of the sound of the pompous words
  which the horn was speaking;
  I watched till the beast was slain,
  and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame.

# Daniel 7:12
  As for the rest of the beasts,
  they had their dominion taken away,
  yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.

# Daniel 7:13
  I was watching in the night visions,
  And behold, One like the Son of Man,
  Coming with the clouds of heaven!

  He came to the Ancient of Days,
  And they brought Him near before Him.

# Daniel 7:14
  Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom,
  That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him.

  His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
  Which shall not pass away,
  And His kingdom the one
  Which shall not be destroyed.

# Daniel 7:15
  I, Daniel, was grieved in my spirit within my body,
  and the visions of my head troubled me.

# Daniel 7:16
  I came near to one of those who stood by,
  and asked him the truth of all this.

# Daniel 7:17
  So he told me and made known to me
  the interpretation of these things:
  {
    Those great beasts, which are four,
    are four kings which arise out of the earth.

# Daniel 7:18
    But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom,
    and possess the kingdom forever,
    even forever and ever.
  }

# Daniel 7:19
  Then I wished to know the truth about the fourth beast,
  which was different from all the others,
  exceedingly dreadful,
  with its teeth of iron and its nails of bronze,
  which devoured,
  broke in pieces,
  and trampled the residue with its feet;
# Daniel 7:20
  and the 10 horns that were on its head,
  and the other horn which came up,
  before which three fell,
  namely, that horn which had eyes and a mouth
  which spoke pompous words,
  whose appearance was greater than his fellows.

# Daniel 7:21
  I was watching;
  and the same horn was making war against the saints,
  and prevailing against them,
# Daniel 7:22
  until the Ancient of Days came,
  and a judgment was made in favor of the saints of the Most High,
  and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom.

# Daniel 7:23
  Thus he said:
  {
    The fourth beast shall be
    A fourth kingdom on earth,
    Which shall be different from all other kingdoms,
    And shall devour the whole earth,
    Trample it and break it in pieces.

# Daniel 7:24
    The 10 horns are 10 kings
    Who shall arise from this kingdom.

    And another shall rise after them;
    He shall be different from the first ones,
    And shall subdue three kings.

# Daniel 7:25
    He shall speak pompous words against the Most High,
    Shall persecute the saints of the Most High,
    And shall intend to change times and law.

    Then the saints shall be given into his hand
    For a time and times and half a time.

# Daniel 7:26
    But the court shall be seated,
    And they shall take away his dominion,
    To consume and destroy it forever.

# Daniel 7:27
    Then the kingdom and dominion,
    And the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven,
    Shall be given to the people,
    the saints of the Most High.

    His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,
    And all dominions shall serve and obey Him.
  }

# Daniel 7:28
  This is the end of the account.

  As for me, Daniel,
  my thoughts greatly troubled me,
  and my countenance changed;
  but I kept the matter in my heart.
}

# Daniel 8:1
In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar
a vision appeared to me --
to me, Daniel --
after the one that appeared to me the first time.

# Daniel 8:2
I saw in the vision,
and it so happened while I was looking,
that I was in Shushan, the citadel,
which is in the province of Elam;
and I saw in the vision that I was by the River Ulai.

# Daniel 8:3
Then I lifted my eyes and saw,
and there, standing beside the river,
was a ram which had two horns,
and the two horns were high;
but one was higher than the other,
and the higher one came up last.

# Daniel 8:4
I saw the ram pushing westward, northward, and southward,
so that no animal could withstand him;
nor was there any that could deliver from his hand,
but he did according to his will and became great.

# Daniel 8:5
And as I was considering,
suddenly a male goat came from the west,
across the surface of the whole earth,
without touching the ground;
and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.

# Daniel 8:6
Then he came to the ram that had two horns,
which I had seen standing beside the river,
and ran at him with furious power.

# Daniel 8:7
And I saw him confronting the ram;
he was moved with rage against him,
attacked the ram,
and broke his two horns.

There was no power in the ram to withstand him,
but he cast him down to the ground and trampled him;
and there was no one that could deliver the ram from his hand.

# Daniel 8:8
Therefore the male goat grew very great;
but when he became strong,
the large horn was broken,
and in place of it four notable ones came up
toward the four winds of heaven.

# Daniel 8:9
And out of one of them came a little horn
which grew exceedingly great toward the south,
toward the east,
and toward the Glorious Land.

# Daniel 8:10
And it grew up to the host of heaven;
and it cast down some of the host
and some of the stars
to the ground,
and trampled them.

# Daniel 8:11
He even exalted himself as high as the Prince of the host;
and by him the daily sacrifices were taken away,
and the place of His sanctuary was cast down.

# Daniel 8:12
Because of transgression,
an army was given over to the horn
to oppose the daily sacrifices;
and he cast truth down to the ground.

He did all this and prospered.

# Daniel 8:13
Then I heard a holy one speaking;
and another holy one said to that certain one who was speaking,
{
  How long will the vision be,
  concerning the daily sacrifices
  and the transgression of desolation,
  the giving of both the sanctuary
  and the host to be trampled under foot?
}

# Daniel 8:14
And he said to me,
{
  For 2300 days;
  then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.
}

# Daniel 8:15
Then it happened, when I, Daniel,
had seen the vision and was seeking the meaning,
that suddenly there stood before me
one having the appearance of a man.

# Daniel 8:16
And I heard a man's voice between the banks of the Ulai,
who called, and said,
{
  Gabriel, make this man understand the vision.
}

# Daniel 8:17
So he came near where I stood,
and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face;
but he said to me,
{
  Understand, son of man,
  that the vision refers to the time of the end.
}

# Daniel 8:18
Now, as he was speaking with me,
I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground;
but he touched me,
and stood me upright.

# Daniel 8:19
And he said,
{
  Look, I am making known to you
  what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation;
  for at the appointed time the end shall be.

# Daniel 8:20
  The ram which you saw,
  having the two horns --
  they are the kings of Media and Persia.

# Daniel 8:21
  And the male goat is the kingdom of Greece.

  The large horn that is between its eyes is the first king.

# Daniel 8:22
  As for the broken horn and the four that stood up in its place,
  four kingdoms shall arise out of that nation,
  but not with its power.

# Daniel 8:23
  And in the latter time of their kingdom,
  When the transgressors have reached their fullness,
  A king shall arise,
  Having fierce features,
  Who understands sinister schemes.

# Daniel 8:24
  His power shall be mighty,
  but not by his own power;
  He shall destroy fearfully,
  And shall prosper and thrive;
  He shall destroy the mighty,
  and also the holy people.

# Daniel 8:25
  Through his cunning
  He shall cause deceit to prosper under his rule;
  And he shall exalt himself in his heart.

  He shall destroy many in their prosperity.

  He shall even rise against the Prince of princes;
  But he shall be broken without human means.

# Daniel 8:26
  And the vision of the evenings and mornings
  Which was told is true;
  Therefore seal up the vision,
  For it refers to many days in the future.
}

# Daniel 8:27
And I, Daniel, fainted and was sick for days;
afterward I arose and went about the king's business.

I was astonished by the vision,
but no one understood it.

# Daniel 9:1
In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus,
of the lineage of the Medes,
who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans --
# Daniel 9:2
in the first year of his reign I, Daniel,
understood by the books
the number of the years specified by the word of the Lord
through Jeremiah the prophet,
that He would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem.

# Daniel 9:3
Then I set my face toward the Lord God
to make request by prayer and supplications,
with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.

# Daniel 9:4
And I prayed to the Lord my God,
and made confession, and said,
{
  O Lord, great and awesome God,
  who keeps His covenant and mercy with those who love Him,
  and with those who keep His commandments,
# Daniel 9:5
  we have sinned and committed iniquity,
  we have done wickedly and rebelled,
  even by departing from Your precepts and Your judgments.

# Daniel 9:6
  Neither have we heeded Your servants the prophets,
  who spoke in Your name to our kings and our princes,
  to our fathers and all the people of the land.

# Daniel 9:7
  O Lord, righteousness belongs to You,
  but to us shame of face,
  as it is this day --
  to the men of Judah,
  to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and all Israel,
  those near and those far off
  in all the countries to which You have driven them,
  because of the unfaithfulness
  which they have committed against You.

# Daniel 9:8
  O Lord, to us belongs shame of face,
  to our kings, our princes, and our fathers,
  because we have sinned against You.

# Daniel 9:9
  To the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness,
  though we have rebelled against Him.

# Daniel 9:10
  We have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God,
  to walk in His laws,
  which He set before us by His servants the prophets.

# Daniel 9:11
  Yes, all Israel has transgressed Your law,
  and has departed so as not to obey Your voice;
  therefore the curse and the oath
  written in the Law of Moses the servant of God
  have been poured out on us,
  because we have sinned against Him.

# Daniel 9:12
  And He has confirmed His words,
  which He spoke against us and against our judges who judged us,
  by bringing upon us a great disaster;
  for under the whole heaven such has never been done
  as what has been done to Jerusalem.

# Daniel 9:13
  As it is written in the Law of Moses,
  all this disaster has come upon us;
  yet we have not made our prayer before the Lord our God,
  that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Your truth.

# Daniel 9:14
  Therefore the Lord has kept the disaster in mind,
  and brought it upon us;
  for the Lord our God is righteous in all the works which He does,
  though we have not obeyed His voice.

# Daniel 9:15
  And now, O Lord our God,
  who brought Your people out of the land of Egypt
  with a mighty hand,
  and made Yourself a name,
  as it is this day --
  we have sinned,
  we have done wickedly!

# Daniel 9:16
  O Lord, according to all Your righteousness, I pray,
  let Your anger and Your fury be turned away
  from Your city Jerusalem, Your holy mountain;
  because for our sins,
  and for the iniquities of our fathers,
  Jerusalem and Your people are a reproach to all those around us.

# Daniel 9:17
  Now therefore, our God,
  hear the prayer of Your servant,
  and his supplications,
  and for the Lord's sake cause Your face to shine on Your sanctuary,
  which is desolate.

# Daniel 9:18
  O my God, incline Your ear and hear;
  open Your eyes and see our desolations,
  and the city which is called by Your name;
  for we do not present our supplications before You
  because of our righteous deeds,
  but because of Your great mercies.

# Daniel 9:19
  O Lord, hear!

  O Lord, forgive!

  O Lord, listen and act!

  Do not delay for Your own sake, my God,
  for Your city and Your people are called by Your name.
}

# Daniel 9:20
Now while I was speaking, praying, and confessing my sin
and the sin of my people Israel,
and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God
for the holy mountain of my God,
# Daniel 9:21
yes, while I was speaking in prayer,
the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning,
being caused to fly swiftly,
reached me about the time of the evening offering.

# Daniel 9:22
And he informed me,
and talked with me,
and said,
{
  O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill to understand.

# Daniel 9:23
  At the beginning of your supplications the command went out,
  and I have come to tell you,
  for you are greatly beloved;
  therefore consider the matter,
  and understand the vision:

# Daniel 9:24
  70 weeks are determined
  For your people and for your holy city,
  To finish the transgression,
  To make an end of sins,
  To make reconciliation for iniquity,
  To bring in everlasting righteousness,
  To seal up vision and prophecy,
  And to anoint the Most Holy.

# Daniel 9:25
  Know therefore and understand,
  That from the going forth of the command
  To restore and build Jerusalem
  Until Messiah the Prince,
  There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks;
  The street shall be built again,
  and the wall,
  Even in troublesome times.

# Daniel 9:26
  And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off,
  but not for Himself;
  And the people of the prince who is to come
  Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.

  The end of it shall be with a flood,
  And till the end of the war desolations are determined.

# Daniel 9:27
  Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for one week;
  But in the middle of the week
  He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering.

  And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate,
  Even until the consummation,
  which is determined,
  Is poured out on the desolate.
}

# Daniel 10:1
In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia
a message was revealed to Daniel,
whose name was called Belteshazzar.

The message was true,
but the appointed time was long;
and he understood the message,
and had understanding of the vision.

# Daniel 10:2
In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three full weeks.

# Daniel 10:3
I ate no pleasant food,
no meat or wine came into my mouth,
nor did I anoint myself at all,
till three whole weeks were fulfilled.

# Daniel 10:4
Now on the twenty-fourth day of the first month,
as I was by the side of the great river,
that is,
the Tigris,

# Daniel 10:5
I lifted my eyes and looked,
and behold,
a certain man clothed in linen,
whose waist was girded with gold of Uphaz!

# Daniel 10:6
His body was like beryl,
his face like the appearance of lightning,
his eyes like torches of fire,
his arms and feet like burnished bronze in color,
and the sound of his words like the voice of a multitude.

# Daniel 10:7
And I, Daniel, alone saw the vision,
for the men who were with me did not see the vision;
but a great terror fell upon them,
so that they fled to hide themselves.

# Daniel 10:8
Therefore I was left alone when I saw this great vision,
and no strength remained in me;
for my vigor was turned to frailty in me,
and I retained no strength.

# Daniel 10:9
Yet I heard the sound of his words;
and while I heard the sound of his words
I was in a deep sleep on my face,
with my face to the ground.

# Daniel 10:10
Suddenly,
a hand touched me,
which made me tremble on my knees and on the palms of my hands.

# Daniel 10:11
And he said to me,
{
  O Daniel, man greatly beloved,
  understand the words that I speak to you,
  and stand upright,
  for I have now been sent to you.
}

While he was speaking this word to me, I stood trembling.

# Daniel 10:12
Then he said to me,
{
  Do not fear, Daniel,
  for from the first day that you set your heart to understand,
  and to humble yourself before your God,
  your words were heard;
  and I have come because of your words.

# Daniel 10:13
  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia
  withstood me 21 days;
  and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me,
  for I had been left alone there with the kings of Persia.

# Daniel 10:14
  Now I have come to make you understand
  what will happen to your people in the latter days,
  for the vision refers to many days yet to come.
}

# Daniel 10:15
When he had spoken such words to me,
I turned my face toward the ground and became speechless.

# Daniel 10:16
And suddenly,
one having the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips;
then I opened my mouth and spoke,
saying to him who stood before me,
{
  My lord, because of the vision my sorrows have overwhelmed me,
  and I have retained no strength.

# Daniel 10:17
  For how can this servant of my lord talk with you, my lord?

  As for me,
  no strength remains in me now, nor is any breath left in me.
}

# Daniel 10:18
Then again, the one having the likeness of a man
touched me and strengthened me.

# Daniel 10:19
And he said,
{
  O man greatly beloved, fear not!

  Peace be to you;
  be strong, yes, be strong!
}

So when he spoke to me I was strengthened, and said,
{
  Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.
}

# Daniel 10:20
Then he said,
{
  Do you know why I have come to you?

  And now I must return to fight with the prince of Persia;
  and when I have gone forth,
  indeed the prince of Greece will come.

# Daniel 10:21
  But I will tell you what is noted in the Scripture of Truth.

  (No one upholds me against these,
  except Michael your prince.

# Daniel 11:1
  Also in the first year of Darius the Mede,
  I, even I, stood up to confirm and strengthen him.)

# Daniel 11:2
  And now I will tell you the truth:
  Behold,
  three more kings will arise in Persia,
  and the fourth shall be far richer than them all;
  by his strength,
  through his riches,
  he shall stir up all against the realm of Greece.

# Daniel 11:3
  Then a mighty king shall arise,
  who shall rule with great dominion,
  and do according to his will.

# Daniel 11:4
  And when he has arisen,
  his kingdom shall be broken up
  and divided toward the four winds of heaven,
  but not among his posterity
  nor according to his dominion with which he ruled;
  for his kingdom shall be uprooted,
  even for others besides these.

# Daniel 11:5
  Also the king of the South shall become strong,
  as well as one of his princes;
  and he shall gain power over him and have dominion.

  His dominion shall be a great dominion.

# Daniel 11:6
  And at the end of some years they shall join forces,
  for the daughter of the king of the South
  shall go to the king of the North
  to make an agreement;
  but she shall not retain the power of her authority,
  and neither he nor his authority shall stand;
  but she shall be given up,
  with those who brought her,
  and with him who begot her,
  and with him who strengthened her in those times.

# Daniel 11:7
  But from a branch of her roots one shall arise in his place,
  who shall come with an army,
  enter the fortress of the king of the North,
  and deal with them and prevail.

# Daniel 11:8
  And he shall also carry their gods captive to Egypt,
  with their princes
  and their precious articles of silver and gold;
  and he shall continue more years than the king of the North.

# Daniel 11:9
  Also the king of the North shall come
  to the kingdom of the king of the South,
  but shall return to his own land.

# Daniel 11:10
  However his sons shall stir up strife,
  and assemble a multitude of great forces;
  and one shall certainly come and overwhelm and pass through;
  then he shall return to his fortress and stir up strife.

# Daniel 11:11
  And the king of the South shall be moved with rage,
  and go out and fight with him,
  with the king of the North,
  who shall muster a great multitude;
  but the multitude shall be given into the hand of his enemy.

# Daniel 11:12
  When he has taken away the multitude,
  his heart will be lifted up;
  and he will cast down tens of thousands,
  but he will not prevail.

# Daniel 11:13
  For the king of the North will return
  and muster a multitude greater than the former,
  and shall certainly come at the end of some years
  with a great army and much equipment.

# Daniel 11:14
  Now in those times many shall rise up
  against the king of the South.

  Also, violent men of your people shall exalt themselves
  in fulfillment of the vision,
  but they shall fall.

# Daniel 11:15
  So the king of the North shall come and build a siege mound,
  and take a fortified city;
  and the forces of the South shall not withstand him.

  Even his choice troops shall have no strength to resist.

# Daniel 11:16
  But he who comes against him
  shall do according to his own will,
  and no one shall stand against him.

  He shall stand in the Glorious Land
  with destruction in his power.

# Daniel 11:17
  He shall also set his face to enter
  with the strength of his whole kingdom,
  and upright ones with him;
  thus shall he do.

  And he shall give him the daughter of women to destroy it;
  but she shall not stand with him,
  or be for him.

# Daniel 11:18
  After this he shall turn his face to the coastlands,
  and shall take many.

  But a ruler shall bring the reproach against them to an end;
  and with the reproach removed,
  he shall turn back on him.

# Daniel 11:19
  Then he shall turn his face toward the fortress of his own land;
  but he shall stumble and fall,
  and not be found.

# Daniel 11:20
  There shall arise in his place one who imposes taxes
  on the glorious kingdom;
  but within a few days he shall be destroyed,
  but not in anger or in battle.

# Daniel 11:21
  And in his place shall arise a vile person,
  to whom they will not give the honor of royalty;
  but he shall come in peaceably,
  and seize the kingdom by intrigue.

# Daniel 11:22
  With the force of a flood
  they shall be swept away
  from before him and be broken,
  and also the prince of the covenant.

# Daniel 11:23
  And after the league is made with him he shall act deceitfully,
  for he shall come up and become strong with a small number of people.

# Daniel 11:24
  He shall enter peaceably,
  even into the richest places of the province;
  and he shall do what his fathers have not done,
  nor his forefathers:
  he shall disperse among them the plunder,
  spoil,
  and riches;
  and he shall devise his plans against the strongholds,
  but only for a time.

# Daniel 11:25
  He shall stir up his power and his courage
  against the king of the South
  with a great army.

  And the king of the South shall be stirred up to battle
  with a very great and mighty army;
  but he shall not stand,
  for they shall devise plans against him.

# Daniel 11:26
  Yes, those who eat of the portion of his delicacies
  shall destroy him;
  his army shall be swept away,
  and many shall fall down slain.

# Daniel 11:27
  Both these kings' hearts shall be bent on evil,
  and they shall speak lies at the same table;
  but it shall not prosper,
  for the end will still be at the appointed time.

# Daniel 11:28
  While returning to his land with great riches,
  his heart shall be moved against the holy covenant;
  so he shall do damage and return to his own land.

# Daniel 11:29
  At the appointed time he shall return and go toward the south;
  but it shall not be like the former or the latter.

# Daniel 11:30
  For ships from Cyprus shall come against him;
  therefore he shall be grieved,
  and return in rage against the holy covenant,
  and do damage.

  So he shall return and show regard
  for those who forsake the holy covenant.

# Daniel 11:31
  And forces shall be mustered by him,
  and they shall defile the sanctuary fortress;
  then they shall take away the daily sacrifices,
  and place there the abomination of desolation.

# Daniel 11:32
  Those who do wickedly against the covenant
  he shall corrupt with flattery;
  but the people who know their God shall be strong,
  and carry out great exploits.

# Daniel 11:33
  And those of the people who understand shall instruct many;
  yet for many days they shall fall by sword and flame,
  by captivity and plundering.

# Daniel 11:34
  Now when they fall,
  they shall be aided with a little help;
  but many shall join with them by intrigue.

# Daniel 11:35
  And some of those of understanding shall fall,
  to refine them,
  purify them,
  and make them white,
  until the time of the end;
  because it is still for the appointed time.

# Daniel 11:36
  Then the king shall do according to his own will:
  he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god,
  shall speak blasphemies against the God of gods,
  and shall prosper till the wrath has been accomplished;
  for what has been determined shall be done.

# Daniel 11:37
  He shall regard neither the God of his fathers
  nor the desire of women,
  nor regard any god;
  for he shall exalt himself above them all.

# Daniel 11:38
  But in their place he shall honor a god of fortresses;
  and a god which his fathers did not know
  he shall honor with gold and silver,
  with precious stones and pleasant things.

# Daniel 11:39
  Thus he shall act against the strongest fortresses
  with a foreign god,
  which he shall acknowledge,
  and advance its glory;
  and he shall cause them to rule over many,
  and divide the land for gain.

# Daniel 11:40
  At the time of the end the king of the South shall attack him;
  and the king of the North
  shall come against him like a whirlwind,
  with chariots,
  horsemen,
  and with many ships;
  and he shall enter the countries,
  overwhelm them,
  and pass through.

# Daniel 11:41
  He shall also enter the Glorious Land,
  and many countries shall be overthrown;
  but these shall escape from his hand:
  Edom,
  Moab,
  and the prominent people of Ammon.

# Daniel 11:42
  He shall stretch out his hand against the countries,
  and the land of Egypt shall not escape.

# Daniel 11:43
  He shall have power over the treasures of gold and silver,
  and over all the precious things of Egypt;
  also the Libyans and Ethiopians shall follow at his heels.

# Daniel 11:44
  But news from the east and the north shall trouble him;
  therefore he shall go out with great fury to destroy and annihilate many.

# Daniel 11:45
  And he shall plant the tents of his palace
  between the seas and the glorious holy mountain;
  yet he shall come to his end,
  and no one will help him.

# Daniel 12:1
  At that time Michael shall stand up,
  The great prince who stands watch over the sons of your people;
  And there shall be a time of trouble,
  Such as never was since there was a nation,
  Even to that time.

  And at that time your people shall be delivered,
  Every one who is found written in the book.

# Daniel 12:2
  And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,
  Some to everlasting life,
  Some to shame and everlasting contempt.

# Daniel 12:3
  Those who are wise shall shine
  Like the brightness of the firmament,
  And those who turn many to righteousness
  Like the stars forever and ever.

# Daniel 12:4
  But you, Daniel, shut up the words,
  and seal the book until the time of the end;
  many shall run to and fro,
  and knowledge shall increase.
}

# Daniel 12:5
Then I, Daniel, looked;
and there stood two others,
one on this riverbank and the other on that riverbank.

# Daniel 12:6
And one said to the man clothed in linen,
who was above the waters of the river,
{
  How long shall the fulfillment of these wonders be?
}

# Daniel 12:7
Then I heard the man clothed in linen,
who was above the waters of the river,
when he held up his right hand and his left hand to heaven,
and swore by Him who lives forever,
that it shall be for a time, times, and half a time;
and when the power of the holy people has been completely shattered,
all these things shall be finished.

# Daniel 12:8
Although I heard, I did not understand.

Then I said,
{
  My lord,
  what shall be the end of these things?
}

# Daniel 12:9
And he said,
{
  Go your way, Daniel,
  for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end.

# Daniel 12:10
  Many shall be purified,
  made white,
  and refined,
  but the wicked shall do wickedly;
  and none of the wicked shall understand,
  but the wise shall understand.

# Daniel 12:11
  And from the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away,
  and the abomination of desolation is set up,
  there shall be 1290 days.

# Daniel 12:12
  Blessed is he who waits,
  and comes to the 1335 days.

# Daniel 12:13
  But you, go your way till the end;
  for you shall rest,
  and will arise to your inheritance at the end of the days.
}
