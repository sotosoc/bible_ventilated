# Numbers 1:1
Now the Lord spoke to Moses
in the Wilderness of Sinai,
in the tabernacle of meeting,
on the first day of the second month,
in the second year
after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:
{
# Numbers 1:2
  Take a census
  of all the congregation
  of the children of Israel,
  by their families,
  by their fathers' houses,
  according to the number of names,
  every male individually,
# Numbers 1:3
  from 20 years old and above --
  all who are able to go to war in Israel.

  You and Aaron shall number them by their armies.

# Numbers 1:4
  And with you there shall be a man from every tribe,
  each one the head of his father's house.

# Numbers 1:5
  These are the names of the men

}

# Numbers 1:16
These were chosen from the congregation,
leaders of their fathers' tribes,
heads of the divisions in Israel.

# Numbers 1:17
Then Moses and Aaron took these men
who had been mentioned by name,
# Numbers 1:18
and they assembled all the congregation together
on the first day of the second month;
and they recited their ancestry by families,
by their fathers' houses,
according to the number of names,
from 20 years old and above,
each one individually.

# Numbers 1:19
As the Lord commanded Moses,
so he numbered them in the Wilderness of Sinai.

# Numbers 1:44
These are the ones who were numbered,
whom Moses and Aaron numbered,
with the leaders of Israel, 12 men,
each one representing his father's house.

# Numbers 1:45
So all who were numbered of the children of Israel,
by their fathers' houses,
from 20 years old and above,
all who were able to go to war in Israel --
# Numbers 1:46
all who were numbered were 603,550.

# Numbers 1:47
But the Levites were not numbered among them by their fathers' tribe;
# Numbers 1:48
for the Lord had spoken to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 1:49
  Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number,
  nor take a census of them among the children of Israel;
# Numbers 1:50
  but you shall appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the Testimony,
  over all its furnishings,
  and over all things that belong to it;
  they shall carry the tabernacle and all its furnishings;
  they shall attend to it and camp around the tabernacle.

# Numbers 1:51
  And when the tabernacle is to go forward,
  the Levites shall take it down;
  and when the tabernacle is to be set up,
  the Levites shall set it up.

  The outsider who comes near shall be put to death.

# Numbers 1:52
  The children of Israel shall pitch their tents,
  everyone by his own camp,
  everyone by his own standard,
  according to their armies;
# Numbers 1:53
  but the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony,
  that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children of Israel;
  and the Levites shall keep charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony.
}

# Numbers 1:54
Thus the children of Israel did;
according to all that the Lord commanded Moses,
so they did.

# Numbers 2:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
{
# Numbers 2:2
  Everyone of the children of Israel shall camp by his own standard,
  beside the emblems of his father's house;
  they shall camp some distance from the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 2:3
  On the east side,
  toward the rising of the sun,
  those of the standard of the forces with Judah
  shall camp according to their armies;
  and Nahshon the son of Amminadab
  shall be the leader of the children of Judah.
}

# Numbers 2:4
And his army was numbered at 74,600.

  Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar,

  shall be the leader of the children of Issachar.
}

And his army was numbered at 59,300.

{
# Numbers 2:14
  Then comes the tribe of Gad,
  and the leader of the children of Gad
  shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.
}

# Numbers 2:15
And his army was numbered at 45,650.

{
# Numbers 2:16
  All who were numbered according to their armies
  of the forces with Reuben, 151,450 --
  they shall be the second to break camp.

# Numbers 2:17
  And the tabernacle of meeting shall move out
  with the camp of the Levites
  in the middle of the camps;
  as they camp,
  so they shall move out,
  everyone in his place,
  by their standards.

# Numbers 2:18
  On the west side shall be the standard
  of the forces with Ephraim according to their armies,
  and the leader of the children of Ephraim
  shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.
}

# Numbers 2:19
And his army was numbered at 40,500.

{
# Numbers 2:20
  Next to him comes the tribe of Manasseh,

}

# Numbers 2:23
And his army was numbered at 35,400.

{

  they shall be the third to break camp.
}

{

  The standard of the forces with Dan shall be on the north side
  according to their armies,

  shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
}

# Numbers 2:26
And his army was numbered at 62,700.

{
# Numbers 2:27
  Those who camp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher,
  and the leader of the children of Asher
  shall be Pagiel the son of Ocran.
}

# Numbers 2:28
And his army was numbered at 41,500.

{
# Numbers 2:29
  Then comes the tribe of Naphtali,
  and the leader of the children of Naphtali
  shall be Ahira the son of Enan.
}

# Numbers 2:30
And his army was numbered at 53,400.

{
# Numbers 2:31
  All who were numbered of the forces with Dan, 157,600 --
  they shall break camp last, with their standards.
}

# Numbers 2:32
These are the ones who were numbered of the children of Israel
by their fathers' houses.

All who were numbered according to their armies of the forces
were 603,550.

# Numbers 2:33
But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel,
just as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Numbers 2:34
Thus the children of Israel did
according to all that the Lord commanded Moses;
so they camped by their standards and so they broke camp,
each one by his family,
according to their fathers' houses.

# Numbers 3:1
Now these are the records of Aaron and Moses
when the Lord spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.

# Numbers 3:2
And these are the names of the sons of Aaron:
Nadab, the firstborn,
and Abihu,
Eleazar,
and Ithamar.

# Numbers 3:3
These are the names of the sons of Aaron,
the anointed priests,
whom he consecrated to minister as priests.

# Numbers 3:4
Nadab and Abihu had died before the Lord
when they offered profane fire before the Lord
in the Wilderness of Sinai;
and they had no children.

So Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priests
in the presence of Aaron their father.

# Numbers 3:5
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 3:6
  Bring the tribe of Levi near,
  and present them before Aaron the priest,
  that they may serve him.

# Numbers 3:7
  And they shall attend to his needs
  and the needs of the whole congregation
  before the tabernacle of meeting,
  to do the work of the tabernacle.

# Numbers 3:8
  Also they shall attend
  to all the furnishings of the tabernacle of meeting,
  and to the needs of the children of Israel,
  to do the work of the tabernacle.

# Numbers 3:9
  And you shall give the Levites to Aaron and his sons;
  they are given entirely to him from among the children of Israel.

# Numbers 3:10
  So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons,
  and they shall attend to their priesthood;
  but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.
}

# Numbers 3:11
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 3:12
  Now behold,
  I Myself have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel
  instead of every firstborn who opens the womb
  among the children of Israel.

  Therefore the Levites shall be Mine,
# Numbers 3:13
  because all the firstborn are Mine.

  On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,
  I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel,
  both man and beast.

  They shall be Mine:
  I am the Lord.
}

# Numbers 3:14
Then the Lord spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying:
{
# Numbers 3:15
  Number the children of Levi by their fathers' houses,
  by their families;
  you shall number every male from a month old and above.
}

# Numbers 3:16
So Moses numbered them according to the word of the Lord,
as he was commanded.

# Numbers 3:17
These were the sons of Levi by their names:
Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

# Numbers 3:18
And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families:
Libni and Shimei.

# Numbers 3:19
And the sons of Kohath by their families:
Amram, Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel.

# Numbers 3:20
And the sons of Merari by their families:
Mahli and Mushi.

These are the families of the Levites by their fathers' houses.

# Numbers 3:21
From Gershon came the family of the Libnites
and the family of the Shimites;
these were the families of the Gershonites.

# Numbers 3:22
Those who were numbered,
according to the number of all the males
from a month old and above --
of those who were numbered there were 7500.

# Numbers 3:23
The families of the Gershonites
were to camp behind the tabernacle westward.

# Numbers 3:24
And the leader of the fathers' house of the Gershonites
was Eliasaph the son of Lael.

# Numbers 3:25
The duties of the children of Gershon in the tabernacle of meeting
included the tabernacle,
the tent with its covering,
the screen for the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
# Numbers 3:26
the screen for the door of the court,
the hangings of the court
which are around the tabernacle and the altar,
and their cords,
according to all the work relating to them.

# Numbers 3:27
From Kohath came the family of the Amramites,
the family of the Izharites,
the family of the Hebronites,
and the family of the Uzzielites;
these were the families of the Kohathites.

# Numbers 3:28
According to the number of all the males,
from a month old and above,
there were 8600 keeping charge of the sanctuary.

# Numbers 3:29
The families of the children of Kohath were to camp
on the south side of the tabernacle.

# Numbers 3:30
And the leader of the fathers' house of the families
of the Kohathites
was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

# Numbers 3:31
Their duty included the ark,
the table,
the lampstand,
the altars,
the utensils of the sanctuary with which they ministered,
the screen,
and all the work relating to them.

# Numbers 3:32
And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
was to be chief over the leaders of the Levites,
with oversight of those who kept charge of the sanctuary.

# Numbers 3:33
From Merari came the family of the Mahlites and the family
of the Mushites;
these were the families of Merari.

# Numbers 3:34
And those who were numbered,
according to the number of all the males
from a month old and above,
were 6200.

# Numbers 3:35
The leader of the fathers' house of the families of Merari
was Zuriel the son of Abihail.

These were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle.

# Numbers 3:36
And the appointed duty of the children of Merari
included the boards of the tabernacle,
its bars,
its pillars,
its sockets,
its utensils,
all the work relating to them,
# Numbers 3:37
and the pillars of the court all around,
with their sockets,
their pegs,
and their cords.

# Numbers 3:38
Moreover those who were to camp before the tabernacle on the east,
before the tabernacle of meeting,
were Moses, Aaron, and his sons,
keeping charge of the sanctuary,
to meet the needs of the children of Israel;
but the outsider who came near was to be put to death.

# Numbers 3:39
All who were numbered of the Levites,
whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the Lord,
by their families,
all the males from a month old and above, were 22,000.

# Numbers 3:40
Then the Lord said to Moses:
{
  Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel
  from a month old and above,
  and take the number of their names.

# Numbers 3:41
  And you shall take the Levites for Me --
  I am the Lord --
  instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel,
  and the livestock of the Levites
  instead of all the firstborn among the livestock
  of the children of Israel.
}

# Numbers 3:42
So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the children of Israel,
as the Lord commanded him.

# Numbers 3:43
And all the firstborn males,
according to the number of names from a month old and above,
of those who were numbered of them, were 22,273.

# Numbers 3:44
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 3:45
  Take the Levites
  instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel,
  and the livestock of the Levites
  instead of their livestock.

  The Levites shall be Mine:
  I am the Lord.

# Numbers 3:46
  And for the redemption of the 273 of the firstborn
  of the children of Israel,
  who are more than the number of the Levites,
# Numbers 3:47
  you shall take five shekels for each one individually;
  you shall take them
  in the currency of the shekel of the sanctuary,
  the shekel of 20 gerahs.

# Numbers 3:48
  And you shall give the money,
  with which the excess number of them is redeemed,
  to Aaron and his sons.
}

# Numbers 3:49
So Moses took the redemption money
from those who were over
and above those who were redeemed by the Levites.

# Numbers 3:50
From the firstborn of the children of Israel
he took the money, 1365 shekels,
according to the shekel of the sanctuary.

# Numbers 3:51
And Moses gave their redemption money to Aaron and his sons,
according to the word of the Lord,
as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Numbers 4:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
{
# Numbers 4:2
  Take a census of the sons of Kohath
  from among the children of Levi,
  by their families,
  by their fathers' house,
# Numbers 4:3
  from 30 years old and above,
  even to 50 years old,
  all who enter the service
  to do the work in the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 4:4
  This is the service of the sons of Kohath
  in the tabernacle of meeting,
  relating to the most holy things:

# Numbers 4:5
  When the camp prepares to journey,
  Aaron and his sons shall come,
  and they shall take down the covering veil
  and cover the ark of the Testimony with it.

# Numbers 4:6
  Then they shall put on it a covering of badger skins,
  and spread over that a cloth entirely of blue;
  and they shall insert its poles.

# Numbers 4:7
  On the table of showbread they shall spread a blue cloth,
  and put on it the dishes,
  the pans,
  the bowls,
  and the pitchers for pouring;
  and the showbread shall be on it.

# Numbers 4:8
  They shall spread over them a scarlet cloth,
  and cover the same with a covering of badger skins;
  and they shall insert its poles.

# Numbers 4:9
  And they shall take a blue cloth
  and cover the lampstand of the light,
  with its lamps,
  its wick-trimmers,
  its trays,
  and all its oil vessels,
  with which they service it.

# Numbers 4:10
  Then they shall put it with all its utensils
  in a covering of badger skins,
  and put it on a carrying beam.

# Numbers 4:11
  Over the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth,
  and cover it with a covering of badger skins;
  and they shall insert its poles.

# Numbers 4:12
  Then they shall take all the utensils of service
  with which they minister in the sanctuary,
  put them in a blue cloth,
  cover them with a covering of badger skins,
  and put them on a carrying beam.

# Numbers 4:13
  Also they shall take away the ashes from the altar,
  and spread a purple cloth over it.

# Numbers 4:14
  They shall put on it all its implements
  with which they minister there --
  the firepans,
  the forks,
  the shovels,
  the basins,
  and all the utensils of the altar --
  and they shall spread on it a covering of badger skins,
  and insert its poles.

# Numbers 4:15
  And when Aaron and his sons
  have finished covering the sanctuary
  and all the furnishings of the sanctuary,
  when the camp is set to go,
  then the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them;
  but they shall not touch any holy thing,
  lest they die.

  These are the things in the tabernacle of meeting
  which the sons of Kohath are to carry.

# Numbers 4:16
  The appointed duty of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
  is the oil for the light,
  the sweet incense,
  the daily grain offering,
  the anointing oil,
  the oversight of all the tabernacle,
  of all that is in it,
  with the sanctuary and its furnishings.
}

# Numbers 4:17
Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
{
# Numbers 4:18
  Do not cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
  from among the Levites;
# Numbers 4:19
  but do this in regard to them,
  that they may live and not die
  when they approach the most holy things:
  Aaron and his sons shall go in and appoint each of them
  to his service and his task.

# Numbers 4:20
  But they shall not go in to watch
  while the holy things are being covered,
  lest they die.
}

# Numbers 4:21
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 4:22
  Also take a census of the sons of Gershon,
  by their fathers' house,
  by their families.

# Numbers 4:23
  From 30 years old and above,
  even to 50 years old,
  you shall number them,
  all who enter to perform the service,
  to do the work in the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 4:24
  This is the service of the families of the Gershonites,
  in serving and carrying:

# Numbers 4:25
  They shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle
  and the tabernacle of meeting with its covering,
  the covering of badger skins that is on it,
  the screen for the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
# Numbers 4:26
  the screen for the door of the gate of the court,
  the hangings of the court
  which are around the tabernacle and altar,
  and their cords,
  all the furnishings for their service
  and all that is made for these things:
  so shall they serve.

# Numbers 4:27
  Aaron and his sons shall assign
  all the service of the sons of the Gershonites,
  all their tasks and all their service.

  And you shall appoint to them all their tasks as their duty.

# Numbers 4:28
  This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon
  in the tabernacle of meeting.

  And their duties shall be under the authority of Ithamar
  the son of Aaron the priest.

  As for the sons of Merari,
  you shall number them by their families
  and by their fathers' house.

# Numbers 4:30
  From 30 years old and above,
  even to 50 years old,
  you shall number them,
  everyone who enters the service
  to do the work of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 4:31
  And this is what they must carry as all their service
  for the tabernacle of meeting:
  the boards of the tabernacle,
  its bars,
  its pillars,
  its sockets,
# Numbers 4:32
  and the pillars around the court
  with their sockets, pegs, and cords,
  with all their furnishings and all their service;
  and you shall assign to each man by name
  the items he must carry.

# Numbers 4:33
  This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
  as all their service for the tabernacle of meeting,
  under the authority of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
}

# Numbers 4:34
And Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of the congregation
numbered the sons of the Kohathites
by their families and by their fathers' house,
# Numbers 4:35
from 30 years old and above,
even to 50 years old,
everyone who entered the service
for work in the tabernacle of meeting;

According to the commandment of the Lord

# Numbers 5:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 5:2
  Command the children of Israel
  that they put out of the camp every leper,
  everyone who has a discharge,
  and whoever becomes defiled by a corpse.

# Numbers 5:3
  You shall put out both male and female;
  you shall put them outside the camp,
  that they may not defile their camps
  in the midst of which I dwell.
}

# Numbers 5:4
And the children of Israel did so,
and put them outside the camp;
as the Lord spoke to Moses,
so the children of Israel did.

# Numbers 5:5
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 5:6
  Speak to the children of Israel:
  {
    When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit
    in unfaithfulness against the Lord,
    and that person is guilty,
# Numbers 5:7
    then he shall confess the sin which he has committed.

    He shall make restitution for his trespass in full,
    plus one-fifth of it,
    and give it to the one he has wronged.

# Numbers 5:8
    But if the man has no relative
    to whom restitution may be made
    for the wrong,
    the restitution for the wrong
    must go to the Lord for the priest,
    in addition to the ram of the atonement
    with which atonement is made for him.

# Numbers 5:9
    Every offering of all the holy things
    of the children of Israel,
    which they bring to the priest,
    shall be his.

# Numbers 5:10
    And every man's holy things shall be his;
    whatever any man gives the priest shall be his.
  }
}

# Numbers 5:11
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 5:12
  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:
  {
    If any man's wife goes astray
    and behaves unfaithfully toward him,
# Numbers 5:13
    and a man lies with her carnally,
    and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband,
    and it is concealed that she has defiled herself,
    and there was no witness against her,
    nor was she caught --
# Numbers 5:14
    if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him
    and he becomes jealous of his wife,
    who has defiled herself;
    or if the spirit of jealousy comes upon him
    and he becomes jealous of his wife,
    although she has not defiled herself --
# Numbers 5:15
    then the man shall bring his wife to the priest.

# Numbers 5:16
    He shall bring the offering required for her,
    one-tenth of an ephah of barley meal;
    he shall pour no oil on it and put no frankincense on it,
    because it is a grain offering of jealousy,
    an offering for remembering,
    for bringing iniquity to remembrance.

# Numbers 5:17
    And the priest shall bring her near,
    and set her before the Lord.

# Numbers 5:18
    The priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel,
    and take some of the dust
    that is on the floor of the tabernacle
    and put it into the water.

# Numbers 5:19
    Then the priest shall stand the woman before the Lord,
    uncover the woman's head,
    and put the offering for remembering in her hands,
    which is the grain offering of jealousy.

    And the priest shall have in his hand
    the bitter water that brings a curse.

# Numbers 5:20
    And the priest shall put her under oath,
    and say to the woman,
    {
      If no man has lain with you,
      and if you have not gone astray to uncleanness
      while under your husband's authority,
      be free from this bitter water that brings a curse.

# Numbers 5:21
      But if you have gone astray
      while under your husband's authority,
      and if you have defiled yourself
      and some man other than your husband has lain with you
    }--
# Numbers 5:22
    then the priest shall put the woman under the oath of the curse,
    and he shall say to the woman --
    {
      the Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people,
      when the Lord makes your thigh rot and your belly swell;
# Numbers 5:23
      and may this water that causes the curse go into your stomach,
      and make your belly swell and your thigh rot.
    }

    Then the woman shall say,
    {
      Amen, so be it.
    }

# Numbers 5:24
    Then the priest shall write these curses in a book,
    and he shall scrape them off into the bitter water.

# Numbers 5:25
    And he shall make the woman drink the bitter water
    that brings a curse,
    and the water that brings the curse
    shall enter her to become bitter.

# Numbers 5:26
    Then the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy
    from the woman's hand,
    shall wave the offering before the Lord,
    and bring it to the altar;
# Numbers 5:27
    and the priest shall take a handful of the offering,
    as its memorial portion,
    burn it on the altar,
    and afterward make the woman drink the water.

# Numbers 5:28
    When he has made her drink the water,
    then it shall be,
    if she has defiled herself
    and behaved unfaithfully toward her husband,
    that the water that brings a curse
    will enter her and become bitter,
    and her belly will swell,
    her thigh will rot,
    and the woman will become a curse among her people.

# Numbers 5:29
    But if the woman has not defiled herself,
    and is clean,
    then she shall be free and may conceive children.

# Numbers 5:30
    This is the law of jealousy,
    when a wife,
    while under her husband's authority,
    goes astray and defiles herself,
# Numbers 5:31
    or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man,
    and he becomes jealous of his wife;
    then he shall stand the woman before the Lord,
    and the priest shall execute all this law upon her.

# Numbers 5:32
    Then the man shall be free from iniquity,
    but that woman shall bear her guilt.
  }
}

# Numbers 6:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 6:2
  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:
  {
    When either a man or woman consecrates an offering
    to take the vow of a Nazirite,
    to separate himself to the Lord,
# Numbers 6:3
    he shall separate himself from wine and similar drink;
    he shall drink neither vinegar made from wine
    nor vinegar made from similar drink;
    neither shall he drink any grape juice,
    nor eat fresh grapes or raisins.

# Numbers 6:4
    All the days of his separation
    he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grapevine,
    from seed to skin.

# Numbers 6:5
    All the days of the vow of his separation
    no razor shall come upon his head;
    until the days are fulfilled
    for which he separated himself to the Lord,
    he shall be holy.

    Then he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.

# Numbers 6:6
    All the days that he separates himself to the Lord
    he shall not go near a dead body.

# Numbers 6:7
    He shall not make himself unclean
    even for his father or his mother,
    for his brother or his sister,
    when they die,
    because his separation to God is on his head.

# Numbers 6:8
    All the days of his separation he shall be holy to the Lord.

# Numbers 6:9
    And if anyone dies very suddenly beside him,
    and he defiles his consecrated head,
    then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing;
    on the seventh day he shall shave it.

# Numbers 6:10
    Then on the eighth day
    he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons
    to the priest,
    to the door of the tabernacle of meeting;
# Numbers 6:11
    and the priest shall offer one as a sin offering
    and the other as a burnt offering,
    and make atonement for him,
    because he sinned in regard to the corpse;
    and he shall sanctify his head that same day.

# Numbers 6:12
    He shall consecrate to the Lord the days of his separation,
    and bring a male lamb in its first year as a trespass offering;
    but the former days shall be lost,
    because his separation was defiled.

# Numbers 6:13
    Now this is the law of the Nazirite:
    When the days of his separation are fulfilled,
    he shall be brought to the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 6:14
    And he shall present his offering to the Lord:
    one male lamb in its first year without blemish
      as a burnt offering,
    one ewe lamb in its first year without blemish
      as a sin offering,
    one ram without blemish
      as a peace offering,
# Numbers 6:15
    a basket of unleavened bread,
    cakes of fine flour mixed with oil,
    unleavened wafers anointed with oil,
    and their grain offering with their drink offerings.

# Numbers 6:16
    Then the priest shall bring them before the Lord
    and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering;
# Numbers 6:17
    and he shall offer the ram
    as a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord,
    with the basket of unleavened bread;
    the priest shall also offer its grain offering
    and its drink offering.

# Numbers 6:18
    Then the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head
    at the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
    and shall take the hair from his consecrated head
    and put it on the fire
    which is under the sacrifice of the peace offering.

# Numbers 6:19
    And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram,
    one unleavened cake from the basket,
    and one unleavened wafer,
    and put them upon the hands of the Nazirite
    after he has shaved his consecrated hair,
# Numbers 6:20
    and the priest shall wave them
    as a wave offering before the Lord;
    they are holy for the priest,
    together with the breast of the wave offering
    and the thigh of the heave offering.

    After that the Nazirite may drink wine.
  }

# Numbers 6:21
  This is the law of the Nazirite
  who vows to the Lord the offering for his separation,
  and besides that,
  whatever else his hand is able to provide;
  according to the vow which he takes,
  so he must do according to the law of his separation.
}

# Numbers 6:22
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 6:23
  Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying,
  {
    This is the way you shall bless the children of Israel.

    Say to them:
    {
# Numbers 6:24
      The Lord bless you and keep you;
# Numbers 6:25
      The Lord make His face shine upon you,
      And be gracious to you;
# Numbers 6:26
      The Lord lift up His countenance upon you,
      And give you peace.
    }
  }

# Numbers 6:27
  So they shall put My name on the children of Israel,
  and I will bless them.
}

# Numbers 7:1
Now it came to pass,
when Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle,
that he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings,
and the altar and all its utensils;
so he anointed them and consecrated them.

# Numbers 7:2
Then the leaders of Israel,
the heads of their fathers' houses,
who were the leaders of the tribes
and over those who were numbered,
made an offering.

# Numbers 7:3
And they brought their offering before the Lord,
six covered carts and 12 oxen,
a cart for every two of the leaders,
and for each one an ox;
and they presented them before the tabernacle.

# Numbers 7:4
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 7:5
  Accept these from them,
  that they may be used
  in doing the work of the tabernacle of meeting;
  and you shall give them to the Levites,
  to every man according to his service.
}

# Numbers 7:6
So Moses took the carts and the oxen,
and gave them to the Levites.

# Numbers 7:7
Two carts and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon,
according to their service;
# Numbers 7:8
and four carts and 8 oxen he gave to the sons of Merari,
according to their service,
under the authority of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

# Numbers 7:9
But to the sons of Kohath he gave none,
because theirs was the service of the holy things,
which they carried on their shoulders.

# Numbers 7:10
Now the leaders offered the dedication offering for the altar
when it was anointed;
so the leaders offered their offering before the altar.

# Numbers 7:11
For the Lord said to Moses,
{
  They shall offer their offering,
  one leader each day,
  for the dedication of the altar.
}

  {
    When you arrange the lamps,
    the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.
  }
}

# Numbers 8:3
And Aaron did so;
he arranged the lamps to face toward the front of the lampstand,
as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Numbers 8:4
Now this workmanship of the lampstand was hammered gold;
from its shaft to its flowers it was hammered work.

According to the pattern which the Lord had shown Moses,
so he made the lampstand.

# Numbers 8:5
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 8:6
  Take the Levites from among the children of Israel
  and cleanse them ceremonially.

# Numbers 8:7
  Thus you shall do to them to cleanse them:
    Sprinkle water of purification on them,
    and let them shave all their body,
    and let them wash their clothes,
    and so make themselves clean.

# Numbers 8:8
  Then let them take a young bull
  with its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil,
  and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering.

# Numbers 8:9
  And you shall bring the Levites
  before the tabernacle of meeting,
  and you shall gather together the whole congregation
  of the children of Israel.

# Numbers 8:10
  So you shall bring the Levites before the Lord,
  and the children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites;
# Numbers 8:11
  and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the Lord,
  like a wave offering from the children of Israel,
  that they may perform the work of the Lord.

# Numbers 8:12
  Then the Levites
  shall lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls,
  and you shall offer one as a sin offering
  and the other as a burnt offering to the Lord,
  to make atonement for the Levites.

# Numbers 8:13
  And you shall stand the Levites before Aaron and his sons,
  and then offer them like a wave offering to the Lord.

# Numbers 8:14
  Thus you shall separate the Levites
  from among the children of Israel,
  and the Levites shall be Mine.

# Numbers 8:15
  After that the Levites
  shall go in to service the tabernacle of meeting.

  So you shall cleanse them and offer them,
  like a wave offering.

# Numbers 8:16
  For they are wholly given to Me
  from among the children of Israel;
  I have taken them for Myself instead of all who open the womb,
  the firstborn of all the children of Israel.

# Numbers 8:17
  For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are Mine,
  both man and beast;
  on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt
  I sanctified them to Myself.

# Numbers 8:18
  I have taken the Levites
  instead of all the firstborn of the children of Israel.

# Numbers 8:19
  And I have given the Levites as a gift
  to Aaron and his sons
  from among the children of Israel,
  to do the work for the children of Israel
  in the tabernacle of meeting,
  and to make atonement for the children of Israel,
  that there be no plague among the children of Israel
  when the children of Israel come near the sanctuary.
}

# Numbers 8:20
Thus Moses and Aaron
and all the congregation of the children of Israel
did to the Levites;
according to all that the Lord commanded Moses
concerning the Levites,
so the children of Israel did to them.

# Numbers 8:21
And the Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes;
then Aaron presented them,
like a wave offering before the Lord,
and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.

# Numbers 8:22
After that the Levites went in to do their work
in the tabernacle of meeting
before Aaron and his sons;
as the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
so they did to them.

# Numbers 8:23
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 8:24
  This is what pertains to the Levites:
    From 25 years old and above one may enter to perform service
    in the work of the tabernacle of meeting;
# Numbers 8:25
    and at the age of 50 years
    they must cease performing this work,
    and shall work no more.

# Numbers 8:26
  They may minister with their brethren
  in the tabernacle of meeting,
  to attend to needs,
  but they themselves shall do no work.

  Thus you shall do to the Levites regarding their duties.
}

# Numbers 9:1
Now the Lord spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai,
in the first month of the second year
after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying:
{
# Numbers 9:2
  Let the children of Israel keep the Passover
  at its appointed time.

# Numbers 9:3
  On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight,
  you shall keep it at its appointed time.

  According to all its rites and ceremonies you shall keep it.
}

# Numbers 9:4
So Moses told the children of Israel
that they should keep the Passover.

# Numbers 9:5
And they kept the Passover
on the fourteenth day of the first month,
at twilight,
in the Wilderness of Sinai;
according to all that the Lord commanded Moses,
so the children of Israel did.

# Numbers 9:6
Now there were certain men who were defiled by a human corpse,
so that they could not keep the Passover on that day;
and they came before Moses and Aaron that day.

# Numbers 9:7
And those men said to him,
{
  We became defiled by a human corpse.

  Why are we kept from presenting the offering of the Lord
  at its appointed time among the children of Israel?
}

# Numbers 9:8
And Moses said to them,
{
  Stand still,
  that I may hear what the Lord will command concerning you.
}

# Numbers 9:9
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 9:10
  Speak to the children of Israel, saying:
  {
    If anyone of you or your posterity is unclean
    because of a corpse,
    or is far away on a journey,
    he may still keep the Lord's Passover.

# Numbers 9:11
    On the fourteenth day of the second month, at twilight,
    they may keep it.

    They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

# Numbers 9:12
    They shall leave none of it until morning,
    nor break one of its bones.

    According to all the ordinances of the Passover
    they shall keep it.

# Numbers 9:13
    But the man who is clean and is not on a journey,
    and ceases to keep the Passover,
    that same person shall be cut off from among his people,
    because he did not bring the offering of the Lord
    at its appointed time;
    that man shall bear his sin.

# Numbers 9:14
    And if a stranger dwells among you,
    and would keep the Lord's Passover,
    he must do so according to the rite of the Passover
    and according to its ceremony;
    you shall have one ordinance,
    both for the stranger and the native of the land.
  }
}

# Numbers 9:15
Now on the day that the tabernacle was raised up,
the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the Testimony;
from evening until morning it was above the tabernacle
like the appearance of fire.

# Numbers 9:16
So it was always:
  the cloud covered it by day,
  and the appearance of fire by night.

# Numbers 9:17
Whenever the cloud was taken up from above the tabernacle,
after that the children of Israel would journey;
and in the place where the cloud settled,
there the children of Israel would pitch their tents.

# Numbers 9:18
At the command of the Lord the children of Israel would journey,
and at the command of the Lord they would camp;
as long as the cloud stayed above the tabernacle
they remained encamped.

# Numbers 9:19
Even when the cloud continued long,
many days above the tabernacle,
the children of Israel kept
the charge of the Lord and did not journey.

# Numbers 9:20
So it was, when the cloud was above the tabernacle a few days:
  according to the command of the Lord they would remain encamped,
  and according to the command of the Lord they would journey.

# Numbers 9:21
So it was,
when the cloud remained only from evening until morning:
  when the cloud was taken up in the morning,
  then they would journey;
  whether by day or by night,
  whenever the cloud was taken up,
  they would journey.

# Numbers 9:22
Whether it was two days, a month, or a year
that the cloud remained above the tabernacle,
the children of Israel would remain encamped and not journey;
but when it was taken up,
they would journey.

# Numbers 9:23
At the command of the Lord they remained encamped,
and at the command of the Lord they journeyed;
they kept the charge of the Lord,
at the command of the Lord by the hand of Moses.

# Numbers 10:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 10:2
  Make two silver trumpets for yourself;
  you shall make them of hammered work;
  you shall use them for calling the congregation
  and for directing the movement of the camps.

# Numbers 10:3
  When they blow both of them,
  all the congregation shall gather before you
  at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 10:4
  But if they blow only one,
  then the leaders, the heads of the divisions of Israel,
  shall gather to you.

# Numbers 10:5
  When you sound the advance,
  the camps that lie on the east side
  shall then begin their journey.

# Numbers 10:6
  When you sound the advance the second time,
  then the camps that lie on the south side
  shall begin their journey;
  they shall sound the call for them to begin their journeys.

# Numbers 10:7
  And when the assembly is to be gathered together,
  you shall blow,
  but not sound the advance.

# Numbers 10:8
  The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets;
  and these shall be to you as an ordinance forever
  throughout your generations.

# Numbers 10:9
  When you go to war in your land
  against the enemy who oppresses you,
  then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets,
  and you will be remembered before the Lord your God,
  and you will be saved from your enemies.

# Numbers 10:10
  Also in the day of your gladness,
  in your appointed feasts,
  and at the beginning of your months,
  you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings
  and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings;
  and they shall be a memorial for you before your God:
    I am the Lord your God.
}

# Numbers 10:11
Now it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month,
in the second year,
that the cloud was taken up
from above the tabernacle of the Testimony.

# Numbers 10:12
And the children of Israel set out
from the Wilderness of Sinai on their journeys;
then the cloud settled down in the Wilderness of Paran.

# Numbers 10:13
So they started out for the first time
according to the command of the Lord
by the hand of Moses.

# Numbers 10:14
The standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out first
according to their armies;
over their army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

# Numbers 10:15
Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar
was Nethanel the son of Zuar.

# Numbers 10:16
And over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun
was Eliab the son of Helon.

# Numbers 10:17
Then the tabernacle was taken down;
and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set out,
carrying the tabernacle.

# Numbers 10:18
And the standard of the camp of Reuben
set out according to their armies;
over their army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

# Numbers 10:19
Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon
was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

# Numbers 10:20
And over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad
was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

# Numbers 10:21
Then the Kohathites set out,
carrying the holy things.

(The tabernacle would be prepared for their arrival.)

# Numbers 10:22
And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out
according to their armies;
over their army was Elishama the son of Ammihud.

# Numbers 10:23
Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh
was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

# Numbers 10:24
And over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
was Abidan the son of Gideoni.

# Numbers 10:25
Then the standard of the camp of the children of Dan
(the rear guard of all the camps)
set out according to their armies;
over their army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

# Numbers 10:26
Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher
was Pagiel the son of Ocran.

# Numbers 10:27
And over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali
was Ahira the son of Enan.

# Numbers 10:28
Thus was the order of march of the children of Israel,
according to their armies,
when they began their journey.

# Numbers 10:29
Now Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite,
Moses' father-in-law,
{
  We are setting out for the place of which the Lord said,
  {
    I will give it to you.
  }

  Come with us, and we will treat you well;
  for the Lord has promised good things to Israel.
}

# Numbers 10:30
And he said to him,
{
  I will not go,
  but I will depart to my own land and to my relatives.
}

# Numbers 10:31
So Moses said,
{
  Please do not leave,
  inasmuch as you know how we are to camp in the wilderness,
  and you can be our eyes.

# Numbers 10:32
  And it shall be,
  if you go with us --
  indeed it shall be --
  that whatever good the Lord will do to us,
  the same we will do to you.
}

# Numbers 10:33
So they departed from the mountain of the Lord
on a journey of three days;
and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them
for the three days' journey,
to search out a resting place for them.

# Numbers 10:34
And the cloud of the Lord was above them by day
when they went out from the camp.

# Numbers 10:35
So it was, whenever the ark set out, that Moses said:
{
  Rise up, O Lord!

  Let Your enemies be scattered,
  And let those who hate You flee before You.
}

# Numbers 10:36
And when it rested, he said:
{
  Return, O Lord,
  To the many thousands of Israel.
}

# Numbers 11:1
Now when the people complained, it displeased the Lord;
for the Lord heard it, and His anger was aroused.

So the fire of the Lord burned among them,
and consumed some in the outskirts of the camp.

# Numbers 11:2
Then the people cried out to Moses,
and when Moses prayed to the Lord,
the fire was quenched.

# Numbers 11:3
So he called the name of the place Taberah,
because the fire of the Lord had burned among them.

# Numbers 11:4
Now the mixed multitude
who were among them yielded to intense craving;
so the children of Israel also wept again and said:
{
  Who will give us meat to eat?

# Numbers 11:5
  We remember the fish which we ate freely in Egypt,
  the cucumbers,
  the melons,
  the leeks,
  the onions,
  and the garlic;
# Numbers 11:6
  but now our whole being is dried up;
  there is nothing at all except this manna before our eyes!
}

# Numbers 11:7
Now the manna was like coriander seed,
and its color like the color of bdellium.

# Numbers 11:8
The people went about and gathered it,
ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar,
cooked it in pans,
and made cakes of it;
and its taste was like the taste of pastry prepared with oil.

# Numbers 11:9
And when the dew fell on the camp in the night,
the manna fell on it.

# Numbers 11:10
Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families,
everyone at the door of his tent;
and the anger of the Lord was greatly aroused;
Moses also was displeased.

# Numbers 11:11
So Moses said to the Lord,
{
  Why have You afflicted Your servant?

  And why have I not found favor in Your sight,
  that You have laid the burden of all these people on me?

# Numbers 11:12
  Did I conceive all these people?

  Did I beget them, that You should say to me,
  {
    Carry them in your bosom,
    as a guardian carries a nursing child,
  }
  to the land which You swore to their fathers?

# Numbers 11:13
  Where am I to get meat to give to all these people?

  For they weep all over me, saying,
  {
    Give us meat, that we may eat.
  }

# Numbers 11:14
  I am not able to bear all these people alone,
  because the burden is too heavy for me.

# Numbers 11:15
  If You treat me like this,
  please kill me here and now --
  if I have found favor in Your sight --
  and do not let me see my wretchedness!
}

# Numbers 11:16
So the Lord said to Moses:
{
  Gather to Me 70 men of the elders of Israel,
  whom you know to be the elders of the people
  and officers over them;
  bring them to the tabernacle of meeting,
  that they may stand there with you.

# Numbers 11:17
  Then I will come down and talk with you there.

  I will take of the Spirit that is upon you
  and will put the same upon them;
  and they shall bear the burden of the people with you,
  that you may not bear it yourself alone.

# Numbers 11:18
  Then you shall say to the people,
  {
    Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow,
    and you shall eat meat;
    for you have wept in the hearing of the Lord, saying,
    {
      Who will give us meat to eat?

      For it was well with us in Egypt.
    }

    Therefore the Lord will give you meat,
    and you shall eat.

# Numbers 11:19
    You shall eat,
    not one day,
    nor two days,
    nor five days,
    nor 10 days,
    nor 20 days,
# Numbers 11:20
    but for a whole month,
    until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you,
    because you have despised the Lord who is among you,
    and have wept before Him, saying,
    {
      Why did we ever come up out of Egypt?
    }
  }
}

# Numbers 11:21
And Moses said,
{
  The people whom I am among are 600,000 men on foot;
  yet You have said,
  {
    I will give them meat,
    that they may eat for a whole month.
  }

# Numbers 11:22
  Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them,
  to provide enough for them?

  Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,
  to provide enough for them?
}

# Numbers 11:23
And the Lord said to Moses,
{
  Has the Lord's arm been shortened?

  Now you shall see whether what I say will happen to you or not.
}

# Numbers 11:24
So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord,
and he gathered the 70 men of the elders of the people
and placed them around the tabernacle.

# Numbers 11:25
Then the Lord came down in the cloud,
and spoke to him,
and took of the Spirit that was upon him,
and placed the same upon the 70 elders;
and it happened,
when the Spirit rested upon them,
that they prophesied,
although they never did so again.

# Numbers 11:26
But two men had remained in the camp:
  the name of one was Eldad,
  and the name of the other Medad.

And the Spirit rested upon them.

Now they were among those listed,
but who had not gone out to the tabernacle;
yet they prophesied in the camp.

# Numbers 11:27
And a young man ran and told Moses, and said,
{
  Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.
}

# Numbers 11:28
So Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' assistant,
one of his choice men, answered and said,
{
  Moses my lord, forbid them!
}

# Numbers 11:29
Then Moses said to him,
{
  Are you zealous for my sake?

  Oh, that all the Lord's people were prophets
  and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!
}

# Numbers 11:30
And Moses returned to the camp,
both he and the elders of Israel.

# Numbers 11:31
Now a wind went out from the Lord,
and it brought quail from the sea
and left them fluttering near the camp,
about a day's journey on this side
and about a day's journey on the other side,
all around the camp,
and about two cubits above the surface of the ground.

# Numbers 11:32
And the people stayed up all that day,
all night, and all the next day,
and gathered the quail
(he who gathered least gathered 10 homers);
and they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.

# Numbers 11:33
But while the meat was still between their teeth,
before it was chewed,
the wrath of the Lord was aroused against the people,
and the Lord struck the people with a very great plague.

# Numbers 11:34
So he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah,
because there they buried the people who had yielded to craving.

# Numbers 11:35
From Kibroth Hattaavah the people moved to Hazeroth,
and camped at Hazeroth.

# Numbers 12:1
Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses
because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married;
for he had married an Ethiopian woman.

# Numbers 12:2
So they said,
{
  Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses?

  Has He not spoken through us also?
}

And the Lord heard it.

# Numbers 12:3
(Now the man Moses was very humble,
more than all men who were on the face of the earth.)

# Numbers 12:4
Suddenly the Lord said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam,
{
  Come out, you three, to the tabernacle of meeting!
}

So the three came out.

# Numbers 12:5
Then the Lord came down in the pillar of cloud
and stood in the door of the tabernacle,
and called Aaron and Miriam.

And they both went forward.

# Numbers 12:6
Then He said,
{
  Hear now My words:
  {
    If there is a prophet among you,
    I, the Lord, make Myself known to him in a vision;
    I speak to him in a dream.

# Numbers 12:7
    Not so with My servant Moses;
    He is faithful in all My house.

# Numbers 12:8
    I speak with him face to face,
    Even plainly, and not in dark sayings;
    And he sees the form of the Lord.

    Why then were you not afraid
    To speak against My servant Moses?
  }
}

# Numbers 12:9
So the anger of the Lord was aroused against them,
and He departed.

# Numbers 12:10
And when the cloud departed from above the tabernacle,
suddenly Miriam became leprous,
as white as snow.

Then Aaron turned toward Miriam,
and there she was, a leper.

# Numbers 12:11
So Aaron said to Moses,
{
  Oh, my lord!

  Please do not lay this sin on us,
  in which we have done foolishly and in which we have sinned.

# Numbers 12:12
  Please do not let her be as one dead,
  whose flesh is half consumed
  when he comes out of his mother's womb!
}

# Numbers 12:13
So Moses cried out to the Lord, saying,
{
  Please heal her, O God, I pray!
}

# Numbers 12:14
Then the Lord said to Moses,
{
  If her father had but spit in her face,
  would she not be shamed seven days?

  Let her be shut out of the camp seven days,
  and afterward she may be received again.
}

# Numbers 12:15
So Miriam was shut out of the camp seven days,
and the people did not journey till Miriam was brought in again.

# Numbers 12:16
And afterward the people moved from Hazeroth
and camped in the Wilderness of Paran.

# Numbers 13:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 13:2
  Send men to spy out the land of Canaan,
  which I am giving to the children of Israel;
  from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man,
  every one a leader among them.
}

# Numbers 13:3
So Moses sent them from the Wilderness of Paran
according to the command of the Lord,
all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.

# Numbers 13:4
Now these were their names:
  from the tribe of Reuben,
  Shammua the son of Zaccur;
# Numbers 13:5
  from the tribe of Simeon,
  Shaphat the son of Hori;
# Numbers 13:6
  from the tribe of Judah,
  Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
# Numbers 13:7
  from the tribe of Issachar,
  Igal the son of Joseph;
# Numbers 13:8
  from the tribe of Ephraim,
  Hoshea the son of Nun;
# Numbers 13:9
  from the tribe of Benjamin,
  Palti the son of Raphu;
# Numbers 13:10
  from the tribe of Zebulun,
  Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
# Numbers 13:11
  from the tribe of Joseph,
  that is,
  from the tribe of Manasseh,
  Gaddi the son of Susi;
# Numbers 13:12
  from the tribe of Dan,
  Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
# Numbers 13:13
  from the tribe of Asher,
  Sethur the son of Michael;
# Numbers 13:14
  from the tribe of Naphtali,
  Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
# Numbers 13:15
  from the tribe of Gad,
  Geuel the son of Machi.

# Numbers 13:16
These are the names of the men
whom Moses sent to spy out the land.

And Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.

# Numbers 13:17
Then Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan,
and said to them,
{
  Go up this way into the South,
  and go up to the mountains,
# Numbers 13:18
  and see what the land is like:
  whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, few or many;
# Numbers 13:19
  whether the land they dwell in is good or bad;
  whether the cities they inhabit are like camps or strongholds;
# Numbers 13:20
  whether the land is rich or poor;
  and whether there are forests there or not.

  Be of good courage.

  And bring some of the fruit of the land.
}

Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.

# Numbers 13:21
So they went up and spied out the land
from the Wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob,
near the entrance of Hamath.

# Numbers 13:22
And they went up through the South and came to Hebron;
Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, were there.

(Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

# Numbers 13:23
Then they came to the Valley of Eshcol,
and there cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes;
they carried it between two of them on a pole.

They also brought some of the pomegranates and figs.

# Numbers 13:24
The place was called the Valley of Eshcol,
because of the cluster which the men of Israel cut down there.

# Numbers 13:25
And they returned from spying out the land after 40 days.

# Numbers 13:26
Now they departed and came back to Moses and Aaron
and all the congregation of the children of Israel
in the Wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh;
they brought back word to them and to all the congregation,
and showed them the fruit of the land.

# Numbers 13:27
Then they told him, and said:
{
  We went to the land where you sent us.

  It truly flows with milk and honey,
  and this is its fruit.

# Numbers 13:28
  Nevertheless the people who dwell in the land are strong;
  the cities are fortified and very large;
  moreover we saw the descendants of Anak there.

# Numbers 13:29
  The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South;
  the Hittites,
  the Jebusites,
  and the Amorites dwell in the mountains;
  and the Canaanites dwell by the sea
  and along the banks of the Jordan.
}

# Numbers 13:30
Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said,
{
  Let us go up at once and take possession,
  for we are well able to overcome it.
}

# Numbers 13:31
But the men who had gone up with him said,
{
  We are not able to go up against the people,
  for they are stronger than we.
}

# Numbers 13:32
And they gave the children of Israel a bad report
of the land which they had spied out, saying,
{
  The land through which we have gone as spies
  is a land that devours its inhabitants,
  and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great stature.

# Numbers 13:33
  There we saw the giants
  (the descendants of Anak came from the giants);
  and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight,
  and so we were in their sight.
}

# Numbers 14:1
So all the congregation lifted up their voices and cried,
and the people wept that night.

# Numbers 14:2
And all the children of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron,
and the whole congregation said to them,
{
  If only we had died in the land of Egypt!

  Or if only we had died in this wilderness!

# Numbers 14:3
  Why has the Lord brought us to this land to fall by the sword,
  that our wives and children should become victims?

  Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?
}

# Numbers 14:4
So they said to one another,
{
  Let us select a leader and return to Egypt.
}

# Numbers 14:5
Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces
before all the assembly of the congregation
of the children of Israel.

# Numbers 14:6
But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
who were among those who had spied out the land,
tore their clothes;
# Numbers 14:7
and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel,
saying:
{
  The land we passed through to spy out
  is an exceedingly good land.

# Numbers 14:8
  If the Lord delights in us,
  then He will bring us into this land and give it to us,
  {
    a land which flows with milk and honey.
  }

# Numbers 14:9
  Only do not rebel against the Lord,
  nor fear the people of the land,
  for they are our bread;
  their protection has departed from them,
  and the Lord is with us.

  Do not fear them.
}

# Numbers 14:10
And all the congregation said to stone them with stones.

Now the glory of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of meeting
before all the children of Israel.

# Numbers 14:11
Then the Lord said to Moses:
{
  How long will these people reject Me?

  And how long will they not believe Me,
  with all the signs which I have performed among them?

# Numbers 14:12
  I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them,
  and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.
}

# Numbers 14:13
And Moses said to the Lord:
{
  Then the Egyptians will hear it,
  for by Your might You brought these people up from among them,
# Numbers 14:14
  and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.

  They have heard that You, Lord, are among these people;
  that You, Lord, are seen face to face
  and Your cloud stands above them,
  and You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day
  and in a pillar of fire by night.

# Numbers 14:15
  Now if You kill these people as one man,
  then the nations which have heard of Your fame will speak, saying,
  {
# Numbers 14:16
    Because the Lord was not able
    to bring this people to the land which He swore to give them,
    therefore He killed them in the wilderness.
  }

# Numbers 14:17
  And now, I pray, let the power of my Lord be great,
  just as You have spoken, saying,
  {
# Numbers 14:18
    The Lord is longsuffering and abundant in mercy,
    forgiving iniquity and transgression;
    but He by no means clears the guilty,
    visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children
    to the third and fourth generation.
  }

# Numbers 14:19
  Pardon the iniquity of this people, I pray,
  according to the greatness of Your mercy,
  just as You have forgiven this people,
  from Egypt even until now.
}

# Numbers 14:20
Then the Lord said:
{
  I have pardoned, according to your word;
# Numbers 14:21
  but truly, as I live,
  all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord --
# Numbers 14:22
  because all these men who have seen My glory
  and the signs which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness,
  and have put Me to the test now these 10 times,
  and have not heeded My voice,
# Numbers 14:23
  they certainly shall not see the land of which I swore to their fathers,
  nor shall any of those who rejected Me see it.

# Numbers 14:24
  But My servant Caleb,
  because he has a different spirit in him and has followed Me fully,
  I will bring into the land where he went,
  and his descendants shall inherit it.

# Numbers 14:25
  Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valley;
  tomorrow turn and move out into the wilderness
  by the Way of the Red Sea.
}

# Numbers 14:26
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
{
# Numbers 14:27
  How long shall I bear with this evil congregation
  who complain against Me?

  I have heard the complaints
  which the children of Israel make against Me.

# Numbers 14:28
  Say to them,
  {
    As I live,
  }
  says the Lord,
  {
    just as you have spoken in My hearing,
    so I will do to you:

# Numbers 14:29
    The carcasses of you who have complained against Me
    shall fall in this wilderness,
    all of you who were numbered,
    according to your entire number,
    from 20 years old and above.

# Numbers 14:30
    Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh
    and Joshua the son of Nun,
    you shall by no means enter the land
    which I swore I would make you dwell in.

# Numbers 14:31
    But your little ones,
    whom you said would be victims,
    I will bring in,
    and they shall know the land which you have despised.

# Numbers 14:32
    But as for you,
    your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness.

# Numbers 14:33
    And your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness 40 years,
    and bear the brunt of your infidelity,
    until your carcasses are consumed in the wilderness.

# Numbers 14:34
    According to the number of the days
    in which you spied out the land,
    40 days,
    for each day you shall bear your guilt one year,
    namely 40 years,
    and you shall know My rejection.

# Numbers 14:35
    I the Lord have spoken this;
    I will surely do so to all this evil congregation
    who are gathered together against Me.

    In this wilderness they shall be consumed,
    and there they shall die.
  }
}

# Numbers 14:36
Now the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land,
who returned and made all the congregation complain against him
by bringing a bad report of the land,
# Numbers 14:37
those very men who brought the evil report about the land,
died by the plague before the Lord.

# Numbers 14:38
But Joshua the son of Nun
and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive,
of the men who went to spy out the land.

# Numbers 14:39
Then Moses told these words to all the children of Israel,
and the people mourned greatly.

# Numbers 14:40
And they rose early in the morning
and went up to the top of the mountain, saying,
{
  Here we are,
  and we will go up to the place which the Lord has promised,
  for we have sinned!
}

# Numbers 14:41
And Moses said,
{
  Now why do you transgress the command of the Lord?

  For this will not succeed.

# Numbers 14:42
  Do not go up,
  lest you be defeated by your enemies,
  for the Lord is not among you.

# Numbers 14:43
  For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you,
  and you shall fall by the sword;
  because you have turned away from the Lord,
  the Lord will not be with you.
}

# Numbers 14:44
But they presumed to go up to the mountaintop;
nevertheless, neither the ark of the covenant of the Lord
nor Moses departed from the camp.

# Numbers 14:45
Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites
who dwelt in that mountain
came down and attacked them,
and drove them back as far as Hormah.

# Numbers 15:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 15:2
  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:
  {
    When you have come into the land you are to inhabit,
    which I am giving to you,
# Numbers 15:3
    and you make an offering by fire to the Lord,
    a burnt offering or a sacrifice,
    to fulfill a vow or as a freewill offering or in your appointed feasts,
    to make a sweet aroma to the Lord,
    from the herd or the flock,
# Numbers 15:4
    then he who presents his offering to the Lord
    shall bring a grain offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour
    mixed with one-fourth of a hin of oil;
# Numbers 15:5
    and one-fourth of a hin of wine
    as a drink offering
    you shall prepare with the burnt offering or the sacrifice,
    for each lamb.

# Numbers 15:6
    Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering
    two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour
    mixed with one-third of a hin of oil;
# Numbers 15:7
    and as a drink offering
    you shall offer one-third of a hin of wine
    as a sweet aroma to the Lord.

# Numbers 15:8
    And when you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering,
    or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow,
    or as a peace offering to the Lord,
# Numbers 15:9
    then shall be offered with the young bull
    a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour
    mixed with half a hin of oil;
# Numbers 15:10
    and you shall bring as the drink offering half a hin of wine
    as an offering made by fire,
    a sweet aroma to the Lord.

# Numbers 15:11
    Thus it shall be done for each young bull,
    for each ram,
    or for each lamb or young goat.

# Numbers 15:12
    According to the number that you prepare,
    so you shall do with everyone according to their number.

# Numbers 15:13
    All who are native-born shall do these things in this manner,
    in presenting an offering made by fire,
    a sweet aroma to the Lord.

# Numbers 15:14
    And if a stranger dwells with you,
    or whoever is among you throughout your generations,
    and would present an offering made by fire,
    a sweet aroma to the Lord,
    just as you do,
    so shall he do.

# Numbers 15:15
    One ordinance shall be for you of the assembly
    and for the stranger who dwells with you,
    an ordinance forever throughout your generations;
    as you are,
    so shall the stranger be before the Lord.

# Numbers 15:16
    One law and one custom shall be for you
    and for the stranger who dwells with you.
  }
}

# Numbers 15:17
Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 15:18
  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:
  {
    When you come into the land to which I bring you,
# Numbers 15:19
    then it will be,
    when you eat of the bread of the land,
    that you shall offer up a heave offering to the Lord.

# Numbers 15:20
    You shall offer up a cake of the first of your ground meal
    as a heave offering;
    as a heave offering of the threshing floor,
    so shall you offer it up.

# Numbers 15:21
    Of the first of your ground meal you shall give to the Lord
    a heave offering throughout your generations.

# Numbers 15:22
    If you sin unintentionally,
    and do not observe all these commandments
    which the Lord has spoken to Moses --
# Numbers 15:23
    all that the Lord has commanded you by the hand of Moses,
    from the day the Lord gave commandment and onward
    throughout your generations --
# Numbers 15:24
    then it will be,
    if it is unintentionally committed,
    without the knowledge of the congregation,
    that the whole congregation shall offer one young bull
    as a burnt offering,
    as a sweet aroma to the Lord,
    with its grain offering and its drink offering,
    according to the ordinance,
    and one kid of the goats as a sin offering.

# Numbers 15:25
    So the priest shall make atonement
    for the whole congregation of the children of Israel,
    and it shall be forgiven them,
    for it was unintentional;
    they shall bring their offering,
    an offering made by fire to the Lord,
    and their sin offering before the Lord,
    for their unintended sin.

# Numbers 15:26
    It shall be forgiven the whole congregation
    of the children of Israel
    and the stranger who dwells among them,
    because all the people did it unintentionally.

# Numbers 15:27
    And if a person sins unintentionally,
    then he shall bring a female goat in its first year
    as a sin offering.

# Numbers 15:28
    So the priest shall make atonement
    for the person who sins unintentionally,
    when he sins unintentionally before the Lord,
    to make atonement for him;
    and it shall be forgiven him.

# Numbers 15:29
    You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally,
    for him who is native-born among the children of Israel
    and for the stranger who dwells among them.

# Numbers 15:30
    But the person who does anything presumptuously,
    whether he is native-born or a stranger,
    that one brings reproach on the Lord,
    and he shall be cut off from among his people.

# Numbers 15:31
    Because he has despised the word of the Lord,
    and has broken His commandment,
    that person shall be completely cut off;
    his guilt shall be upon him.
  }
}

# Numbers 15:32
Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness,
they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.

# Numbers 15:33
And those who found him gathering sticks
brought him to Moses and Aaron,
and to all the congregation.

# Numbers 15:34
They put him under guard,
because it had not been explained what should be done to him.

# Numbers 15:35
Then the Lord said to Moses,
{
  The man must surely be put to death;
  all the congregation shall stone him
  with stones outside the camp.
}

# Numbers 15:36
So, as the Lord commanded Moses,
all the congregation brought him outside the camp
and stoned him with stones,
and he died.

# Numbers 15:37
Again the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 15:38
  Speak to the children of Israel:

  Tell them to make tassels on the corners of their garments
  throughout their generations,
  and to put a blue thread in the tassels of the corners.

# Numbers 15:39
  And you shall have the tassel,
  that you may look upon it
  and remember all the commandments of the Lord and do them,
  and that you may not follow the harlotry
  to which your own heart and your own eyes are inclined,
# Numbers 15:40
  and that you may remember and do all My commandments,
  and be holy for your God.

# Numbers 15:41
  I am the Lord your God,
  who brought you out of the land of Egypt,
  to be your God:
    I am the Lord your God.
}

# Numbers 16:1
Now Korah the son of Izhar,
  the son of Kohath,
  the son of Levi,
with Dathan and Abiram
  the sons of Eliab,
and On
  the son of Peleth,
sons of Reuben, took men;
# Numbers 16:2
and they rose up before Moses
with some of the children of Israel,
250 leaders of the congregation,
representatives of the congregation,
men of renown.

# Numbers 16:3
They gathered together against Moses and Aaron,
and said to them,
{
  You take too much upon yourselves,
  for all the congregation is holy,
  every one of them,
  and the Lord is among them.

  Why then do you exalt yourselves
  above the assembly of the Lord?
}

# Numbers 16:4
So when Moses heard it, he fell on his face;
# Numbers 16:5
and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying,
{
  Tomorrow morning the Lord will show who is His and who is holy,
  and will cause him to come near to Him.

  That one whom He chooses He will cause to come near to Him.

# Numbers 16:6
  Do this:

  Take censers, Korah and all your company;
# Numbers 16:7
  put fire in them and put incense in them
  before the Lord tomorrow,
  and it shall be that the man whom the Lord chooses
  is the holy one.

  You take too much upon yourselves, you sons of Levi!
}

# Numbers 16:8
Then Moses said to Korah,
{
  Hear now, you sons of Levi:

# Numbers 16:9
  Is it a small thing to you
  that the God of Israel
  has separated you from the congregation of Israel,
  to bring you near to Himself,
  to do the work of the tabernacle of the Lord,
  and to stand before the congregation to serve them;
# Numbers 16:10
  and that He has brought you near to Himself,
  you and all your brethren, the sons of Levi, with you?

  And are you seeking the priesthood also?

# Numbers 16:11
  Therefore you and all your company
  are gathered together against the Lord.

  And what is Aaron that you complain against him?
}

# Numbers 16:12
And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab,
but they said,
{
  We will not come up!

# Numbers 16:13
  Is it a small thing
  that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey,
  to kill us in the wilderness,
  that you should keep acting like a prince over us?

# Numbers 16:14
  Moreover you have not brought us into a land
  flowing with milk and honey,
  nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards.

  Will you put out the eyes of these men?

  We will not come up!
}

# Numbers 16:15
Then Moses was very angry, and said to the Lord,
{
  Do not respect their offering.

  I have not taken one donkey from them,
  nor have I hurt one of them.
}

# Numbers 16:16
And Moses said to Korah,
{
  Tomorrow, you and all your company be present before the Lord --
  you and they, as well as Aaron.

# Numbers 16:17
  Let each take his censer and put incense in it,
  and each of you bring his censer before the Lord, 250 censers;
  both you and Aaron,
  each with his censer.
}

# Numbers 16:18
So every man took his censer,
put fire in it,
laid incense on it,
and stood at the door of the tabernacle of meeting
with Moses and Aaron.

# Numbers 16:19
And Korah gathered all the congregation against them
at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

Then the glory of the Lord appeared to all the congregation.

# Numbers 16:20
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
{
# Numbers 16:21
  Separate yourselves from among this congregation,
  that I may consume them in a moment.
}

# Numbers 16:22
Then they fell on their faces, and said,
{
  O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh,
  shall one man sin,
  and You be angry with all the congregation?
}

# Numbers 16:23
So the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 16:24
  Speak to the congregation, saying,
  {
    Get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
  }
}

# Numbers 16:25
Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram,
and the elders of Israel followed him.

# Numbers 16:26
And he spoke to the congregation, saying,
{
  Depart now from the tents of these wicked men!

  Touch nothing of theirs,
  lest you be consumed in all their sins.
}

# Numbers 16:27
So they got away
from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram;
and Dathan and Abiram came out
and stood at the door of their tents,
with their wives, their sons, and their little children.

# Numbers 16:28
And Moses said:
{
  By this you shall know
  that the Lord has sent me to do all these works,
  for I have not done them of my own will.

# Numbers 16:29
  If these men die naturally like all men,
  or if they are visited by the common fate of all men,
  then the Lord has not sent me.

# Numbers 16:30
  But if the Lord creates a new thing,
  and the earth opens its mouth
  and swallows them up with all that belongs to them,
  and they go down alive into the pit,
  then you will understand that these men have rejected the Lord.
}

# Numbers 16:31
Now it came to pass,
as he finished speaking all these words,
that the ground split apart under them,
# Numbers 16:32
and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up,
with their households and all the men with Korah,
with all their goods.

# Numbers 16:33
So they and all those with them went down alive into the pit;
the earth closed over them,
and they perished from among the assembly.

# Numbers 16:34
Then all Israel who were around them fled at their cry,
for they said,
{
  Lest the earth swallow us up also!
}

# Numbers 16:35
And a fire came out from the Lord
and consumed the 250 men who were offering incense.

# Numbers 16:36
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 16:37
  Tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
  to pick up the censers out of the blaze,
  for they are holy,
  and scatter the fire some distance away.

# Numbers 16:38
  The censers of these men who sinned against their own souls,
  let them be made into hammered plates
  as a covering for the altar.

  Because they presented them before the Lord,
  therefore they are holy;
  and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.
}

# Numbers 16:39
So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers,
which those who were burned up had presented,
and they were hammered out as a covering on the altar,
# Numbers 16:40
to be a memorial to the children of Israel that no outsider,
who is not a descendant of Aaron,
should come near to offer incense before the Lord,
that he might not become like Korah and his companions,
just as the Lord had said to him through Moses.

# Numbers 16:41
On the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel
murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying,
{
  You have killed the people of the Lord.
}

# Numbers 16:42
Now it happened,
when the congregation had gathered against Moses and Aaron,
that they turned toward the tabernacle of meeting;
and suddenly the cloud covered it,
and the glory of the Lord appeared.

# Numbers 16:43
Then Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 16:44
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 16:45
  Get away from among this congregation,
  that I may consume them in a moment.
}

And they fell on their faces.

# Numbers 16:46
So Moses said to Aaron,
{
  Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar,
  put incense on it,
  and take it quickly to the congregation
  and make atonement for them;
  for wrath has gone out from the Lord.

  The plague has begun.
}

# Numbers 16:47
Then Aaron took it as Moses commanded,
and ran into the midst of the assembly;
and already the plague had begun among the people.

So he put in the incense and made atonement for the people.

# Numbers 16:48
And he stood between the dead and the living;
so the plague was stopped.

# Numbers 16:49
Now those who died in the plague were 14,700,
besides those who died in the Korah incident.

# Numbers 16:50
So Aaron returned to Moses
at the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
for the plague had stopped.

# Numbers 17:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 17:2
  Speak to the children of Israel,
  and get from them a rod from each father's house,
  all their leaders according to their fathers' houses -- 12 rods.

  Write each man's name on his rod.

# Numbers 17:3
  And you shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi.

  For there shall be one rod for the head of each father's house.

# Numbers 17:4
  Then you shall place them
  in the tabernacle of meeting before the Testimony,
  where I meet with you.

# Numbers 17:5
  And it shall be that the rod of the man whom I choose
  will blossom;
  thus I will rid Myself
  of the complaints
  of the children of Israel,
  which they make against you.
}

# Numbers 17:6
So Moses spoke to the children of Israel,
and each of their leaders gave him a rod apiece,
for each leader according to their fathers' houses, 12 rods;
and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.

# Numbers 17:7
And Moses placed the rods
before the Lord in the tabernacle of witness.

# Numbers 17:8
Now it came to pass on the next day
that Moses went into the tabernacle of witness,
and behold, the rod of Aaron, of the house of Levi,
had sprouted and put forth buds,
had produced blossoms and yielded ripe almonds.

# Numbers 17:9
Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord
to all the children of Israel;
and they looked,
and each man took his rod.

# Numbers 17:10
And the Lord said to Moses,
{
  Bring Aaron's rod back before the Testimony,
  to be kept as a sign against the rebels,
  that you may put their complaints away from Me,
  lest they die.
}

# Numbers 17:11
Thus did Moses;
just as the Lord had commanded him, so he did.

# Numbers 17:12
So the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying,
{
  Surely we die, we perish, we all perish!

# Numbers 17:13
  Whoever even comes near the tabernacle of the Lord must die.

  Shall we all utterly die?
}

# Numbers 18:1
Then the Lord said to Aaron:
{
  You and your sons and your father's house with you
  shall bear the iniquity related to the sanctuary,
  and you and your sons with you
  shall bear the iniquity associated with your priesthood.

# Numbers 18:2
  Also bring with you your brethren of the tribe of Levi,
  the tribe of your father,
  that they may be joined with you and serve you
  while you and your sons are with you
  before the tabernacle of witness.

# Numbers 18:3
  They shall attend to your needs
  and all the needs of the tabernacle;
  but they shall not come near the articles
  of the sanctuary and the altar,
  lest they die -- they and you also.

# Numbers 18:4
  They shall be joined with you
  and attend to the needs of the tabernacle of meeting,
  for all the work of the tabernacle;
  but an outsider shall not come near you.

# Numbers 18:5
  And you shall attend
  to the duties of the sanctuary and the duties of the altar,
  that there may be no more wrath on the children of Israel.

# Numbers 18:6
  Behold, I Myself have taken your brethren the Levites
  from among the children of Israel;
  they are a gift to you, given by the Lord,
  to do the work of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 18:7
  Therefore you and your sons with you
  shall attend to your priesthood
  for everything at the altar and behind the veil;
  and you shall serve.

  I give your priesthood to you as a gift for service,
  but the outsider who comes near shall be put to death.
}

# Numbers 18:8
And the Lord spoke to Aaron:
{
  Here,
  I Myself have also given you charge of My heave offerings,
  all the holy gifts of the children of Israel;
  I have given them as a portion to you and your sons,
  as an ordinance forever.

# Numbers 18:9
  This shall be yours of the most holy things
  reserved from the fire:
    every offering of theirs,
    every grain offering
    and every sin offering
    and every trespass offering
    which they render to Me,
    shall be most holy for you and your sons.

# Numbers 18:10
  In a most holy place you shall eat it;
  every male shall eat it.

  It shall be holy to you.

# Numbers 18:11
  This also is yours:
    the heave offering of their gift,
    with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel;
    I have given them to you,
    and your sons and daughters with you,
    as an ordinance forever.

  Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.

# Numbers 18:12
  All the best of the oil,
  all the best of the new wine and the grain,
  their firstfruits which they offer to the Lord,
  I have given them to you.

# Numbers 18:13
  Whatever first ripe fruit is in their land,
  which they bring to the Lord,
  shall be yours.

  Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.

# Numbers 18:14
  Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.

# Numbers 18:15
  Everything that first opens the womb of all flesh,
  which they bring to the Lord,
  whether man or beast,
  shall be yours;
  nevertheless the firstborn of man you shall surely redeem,
  and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem.

# Numbers 18:16
  And those redeemed of the devoted things
  you shall redeem when one month old,
  according to your valuation,
  for five shekels of silver,
  according to the shekel of the sanctuary,
  which is 20 gerahs.

# Numbers 18:17
  But the firstborn of a cow,
  the firstborn of a sheep,
  or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem;
  they are holy.

  You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar,
  and burn their fat as an offering made by fire
  for a sweet aroma to the Lord.

# Numbers 18:18
  And their flesh shall be yours,
  just as the wave breast and the right thigh are yours.

# Numbers 18:19
  All the heave offerings of the holy things,
  which the children of Israel offer to the Lord,
  I have given to you and your sons and daughters with you
  as an ordinance forever;
  it is a covenant of salt forever before the Lord
  with you and your descendants with you.
}

# Numbers 18:20
Then the Lord said to Aaron:
{
  You shall have no inheritance in their land,
  nor shall you have any portion among them;
  I am your portion and your inheritance
  among the children of Israel.

# Numbers 18:21
  Behold,
  I have given the children of Levi all the tithes in Israel
  as an inheritance
  in return for the work which they perform,
  the work of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 18:22
  Hereafter the children of Israel
  shall not come near the tabernacle of meeting,
  lest they bear sin and die.

# Numbers 18:23
  But the Levites
  shall perform the work of the tabernacle of meeting,
  and they shall bear their iniquity;
  it shall be a statute forever,
  throughout your generations,
  that among the children of Israel
  they shall have no inheritance.

# Numbers 18:24
  For the tithes of the children of Israel,
  which they offer up as a heave offering to the Lord,
  I have given to the Levites as an inheritance;
  therefore I have said to them,
  {
    Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
  }
}

# Numbers 18:25
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 18:26
  Speak thus to the Levites, and say to them:
  {
    When you take from the children of Israel the tithes
    which I have given you from them as your inheritance,
    then you shall offer up a heave offering of it to the Lord,
    a tenth of the tithe.

# Numbers 18:27
    And your heave offering shall be reckoned to you
    as though it were the grain of the threshing floor
    and as the fullness of the winepress.

# Numbers 18:28
    Thus you shall also offer a heave offering to the Lord
    from all your tithes which you receive from the children of Israel,
    and you shall give the Lord's heave offering from it
    to Aaron the priest.

# Numbers 18:29
    Of all your gifts
    you shall offer up every heave offering due to the Lord,
    from all the best of them,
    the consecrated part of them.
  }

# Numbers 18:30
  Therefore you shall say to them:
  {
    When you have lifted up the best of it,
    then the rest shall be accounted to the Levites
    as the produce of the threshing floor
    and as the produce of the winepress.

# Numbers 18:31
    You may eat it in any place,
    you and your households,
    for it is your reward for your work
    in the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 18:32
    And you shall bear no sin because of it,
    when you have lifted up the best of it.

    But you shall not profane the holy gifts
    of the children of Israel,
    lest you die.
  }
}

# Numbers 19:1
Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
{
# Numbers 19:2
  This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord has commanded,
  saying:
  {
    Speak to the children of Israel,
    that they bring you a red heifer without blemish,
    in which there is no defect
    and on which a yoke has never come.

# Numbers 19:3
    You shall give it to Eleazar the priest,
    that he may take it outside the camp,
    and it shall be slaughtered before him;
# Numbers 19:4
    and Eleazar the priest
    shall take some of its blood with his finger,
    and sprinkle some of its blood seven times
    directly in front of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 19:5
    Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight:
      its hide,
      its flesh,
      its blood,
      and its offal shall be burned.

# Numbers 19:6
    And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet,
    and cast them into the midst of the fire burning the heifer.

# Numbers 19:7
    Then the priest shall wash his clothes,
    he shall bathe in water,
    and afterward he shall come into the camp;
    the priest shall be unclean until evening.

# Numbers 19:8
    And the one who burns it shall wash his clothes in water,
    bathe in water,
    and shall be unclean until evening.

# Numbers 19:9
    Then a man who is clean
    shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,
    and store them outside the camp in a clean place;
    and they shall be kept for the congregation
    of the children of Israel
    for the water of purification;
    it is for purifying from sin.

# Numbers 19:10
    And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer
    shall wash his clothes,
    and be unclean until evening.

    It shall be a statute forever
    to the children of Israel
    and to the stranger who dwells among them.

# Numbers 19:11
    He who touches the dead body of anyone
    shall be unclean seven days.

# Numbers 19:12
    He shall purify himself with the water
    on the third day and on the seventh day;
    then he will be clean.

    But if he does not purify himself on the third day
    and on the seventh day, he will not be clean.

# Numbers 19:13
    Whoever touches the body of anyone who has died,
    and does not purify himself,
    defiles the tabernacle of the Lord.

    That person shall be cut off from Israel.

    He shall be unclean,
    because the water of purification was not sprinkled on him;
    his uncleanness is still on him.

# Numbers 19:14
    This is the law when a man dies in a tent:
    All who come into the tent and all who are in the tent
    shall be unclean seven days;
# Numbers 19:15
    and every open vessel,
    which has no cover fastened on it, is unclean.

# Numbers 19:16
    Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain by a sword
    or who has died,
    or a bone of a man,
    or a grave,
    shall be unclean seven days.

# Numbers 19:17
    And for an unclean person
    they shall take some of the ashes of the heifer
    burnt for purification from sin,
    and running water shall be put on them in a vessel.

# Numbers 19:18
    A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water,
    sprinkle it on the tent,
    on all the vessels,
    on the persons who were there,
    or on the one who touched a bone,
    the slain,
    the dead,
    or a grave.

# Numbers 19:19
    The clean person shall sprinkle the unclean
    on the third day and on the seventh day;
    and on the seventh day he shall purify himself,
    wash his clothes,
    and bathe in water;
    and at evening he shall be clean.

# Numbers 19:20
    But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself,
    that person shall be cut off from among the assembly,
    because he has defiled the sanctuary of the Lord.

    The water of purification has not been sprinkled on him;
    he is unclean.

# Numbers 19:21
    It shall be a perpetual statute for them.

    He who sprinkles the water of purification
    shall wash his clothes;
    and he who touches the water of purification
    shall be unclean until evening.

# Numbers 19:22
    Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean;
    and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.
  }
}

# Numbers 20:1
Then the children of Israel, the whole congregation,
came into the Wilderness of Zin in the first month,
and the people stayed in Kadesh;
and Miriam died there and was buried there.

# Numbers 20:2
Now there was no water for the congregation;
so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron.

# Numbers 20:3
And the people contended with Moses and spoke, saying:
{
  If only we had died when our brethren died before the Lord!

# Numbers 20:4
  Why have you brought up the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness,
  that we and our animals should die here?

# Numbers 20:5
  And why have you made us come up out of Egypt,
  to bring us to this evil place?

  It is not a place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates;
  nor is there any water to drink.
}

# Numbers 20:6
So Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly
to the door of the tabernacle of meeting,
and they fell on their faces.

And the glory of the Lord appeared to them.

# Numbers 20:7
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 20:8
  Take the rod;
  you and your brother Aaron gather the congregation together.

  Speak to the rock before their eyes,
  and it will yield its water;
  thus you shall bring water for them out of the rock,
  and give drink to the congregation and their animals.
}

# Numbers 20:9
So Moses took the rod from before the Lord as He commanded him.

# Numbers 20:10
And Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock;
and he said to them,
{
  Hear now, you rebels!

  Must we bring water for you out of this rock?
}

# Numbers 20:11
Then Moses lifted his hand
and struck the rock twice with his rod;
and water came out abundantly,
and the congregation and their animals drank.

# Numbers 20:12
Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron,
{
  Because you did not believe Me,
  to hallow Me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
  therefore you shall not bring this assembly
  into the land which I have given them.
}

# Numbers 20:13
This was the water of Meribah,
because the children of Israel contended with the Lord,
and He was hallowed among them.

# Numbers 20:14
Now Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom.
{
  Thus says your brother Israel:
  {
    You know all the hardship that has befallen us,
# Numbers 20:15
    how our fathers went down to Egypt,
    and we dwelt in Egypt a long time,
    and the Egyptians afflicted us and our fathers.

# Numbers 20:16
    When we cried out to the Lord,
    He heard our voice and sent the Angel
    and brought us up out of Egypt;
    now here we are in Kadesh,
    a city on the edge of your border.

# Numbers 20:17
    Please let us pass through your country.

    We will not pass through fields or vineyards,
    nor will we drink water from wells;
    we will go along the King's Highway;
    we will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left
    until we have passed through your territory.
  }
}

# Numbers 20:18
Then Edom said to him,
{
  You shall not pass through my land,
  lest I come out against you with the sword.
}

# Numbers 20:19
So the children of Israel said to him,
{
  We will go by the Highway,
  and if I or my livestock drink any of your water,
  then I will pay for it;
  let me only pass through on foot,
  nothing more.
}

# Numbers 20:20
Then he said,
{
  You shall not pass through.
}

So Edom came out against them
with many men and with a strong hand.

# Numbers 20:21
Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory;
so Israel turned away from him.

# Numbers 20:22
Then the children of Israel, the whole congregation,
journeyed from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.

# Numbers 20:23
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor
by the border of the land of Edom, saying:
{
# Numbers 20:24
  Aaron shall be gathered to his people,
  for he shall not enter the land
  which I have given to the children of Israel,
  because you rebelled against My word at the water of Meribah.

# Numbers 20:25
  Take Aaron and Eleazar his son,
  and bring them up to Mount Hor;
# Numbers 20:26
  and strip Aaron of his garments
  and put them on Eleazar his son;
  for Aaron shall be gathered to his people and die there.
}

# Numbers 20:27
So Moses did just as the Lord commanded,
and they went up to Mount Hor
in the sight of all the congregation.

# Numbers 20:28
Moses stripped Aaron of his garments
and put them on Eleazar his son;
and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain.

Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.

# Numbers 20:29
Now when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead,
all the house of Israel mourned for Aaron 30 days.

# Numbers 21:1
The king of Arad, the Canaanite, who dwelt in the South,
heard that Israel was coming on the road to Atharim,
then he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoners.

# Numbers 21:2
So Israel made a vow to the Lord, and said,
{
  If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand,
  then I will utterly destroy their cities.
}

# Numbers 21:3
And the Lord listened to the voice of Israel
and delivered up the Canaanites,
and they utterly destroyed them and their cities.

So the name of that place was called Hormah.

# Numbers 21:4
Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the Way of the Red Sea,
to go around the land of Edom;
and the soul of the people became very discouraged on the way.

# Numbers 21:5
And the people spoke against God and against Moses:
{
  Why have you brought us up out of Egypt
  to die in the wilderness?

  For there is no food and no water,
  and our soul loathes this worthless bread.
}

# Numbers 21:6
So the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people,
and they bit the people;
and many of the people of Israel died.

# Numbers 21:7
Therefore the people came to Moses, and said,
{
  We have sinned,
  for we have spoken against the Lord and against you;
  pray to the Lord that He take away the serpents from us.
}

So Moses prayed for the people.

# Numbers 21:8
Then the Lord said to Moses,
{
  Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole;
  and it shall be that everyone who is bitten,
  when he looks at it, shall live.
}

# Numbers 21:9
So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole;
and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone,
when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.

# Numbers 21:10
Now the children of Israel moved on and camped in Oboth.

# Numbers 21:11
And they journeyed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim,
in the wilderness which is east of Moab,
toward the sunrise.

# Numbers 21:12
From there they moved and camped in the Valley of Zered.

# Numbers 21:13
From there they moved and camped on the other side of the Arnon,
which is in the wilderness
that extends from the border of the Amorites;
for the Arnon is the border of Moab,
between Moab and the Amorites.

# Numbers 21:14
Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of the Lord:
{
  Waheb in Suphah,
  The brooks of the Arnon,

# Numbers 21:15
  And the slope of the brooks
  That reaches to the dwelling of Ar,
  And lies on the border of Moab.
}

# Numbers 21:16
From there they went to Beer,
which is the well where the Lord said to Moses,
{
  Gather the people together,
  and I will give them water.
}

# Numbers 21:17
Then Israel sang this song:
{
  Spring up, O well!

  All of you sing to it --
# Numbers 21:18
  The well the leaders sank,
  Dug by the nation's nobles,
  By the lawgiver, with their staves.
}

And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah,
# Numbers 21:19
from Mattanah to Nahaliel,
from Nahaliel to Bamoth,
# Numbers 21:20
and from Bamoth, in the valley that is in the country of Moab,
to the top of Pisgah which looks down on the wasteland.

# Numbers 21:21
Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites,
saying,
{
# Numbers 21:22
  Let me pass through your land.

  We will not turn aside into fields or vineyards;
  we will not drink water from wells.

  We will go by the King's Highway
  until we have passed through your territory.
}

# Numbers 21:23
But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory.

So Sihon gathered all his people together
and went out against Israel in the wilderness,
and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.

# Numbers 21:24
Then Israel defeated him with the edge of the sword,
and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok,
as far as the people of Ammon;
for the border of the people of Ammon was fortified.

# Numbers 21:25
So Israel took all these cities,
and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites,
in Heshbon and in all its villages.

# Numbers 21:26
For Heshbon was the city of Sihon king of the Amorites,
who had fought against the former king of Moab,
and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon.

# Numbers 21:27
Therefore those who speak in proverbs say:
{
  Come to Heshbon, let it be built;
  Let the city of Sihon be repaired.

# Numbers 21:28
  For fire went out from Heshbon,
  A flame from the city of Sihon;
  It consumed Ar of Moab,
  The lords of the heights of the Arnon.

# Numbers 21:29
  Woe to you, Moab!

  You have perished, O people of Chemosh!

  He has given his sons as fugitives,
  And his daughters into captivity,
  To Sihon king of the Amorites.

# Numbers 21:30
  But we have shot at them;
  Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon.

  Then we laid waste as far as Nophah,
  Which reaches to Medeba.
}

# Numbers 21:31
Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

# Numbers 21:32
Then Moses sent to spy out Jazer;
and they took its villages
and drove out the Amorites who were there.

# Numbers 21:33
And they turned and went up by the way to Bashan.

So Og king of Bashan went out against them,
he and all his people,
to battle at Edrei.

# Numbers 21:34
Then the Lord said to Moses,
{
  Do not fear him,
  for I have delivered him into your hand,
  with all his people and his land;
  and you shall do to him
  as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,
  who dwelt at Heshbon.
}

# Numbers 21:35
So they defeated him, his sons, and all his people,
until there was no survivor left him;
and they took possession of his land.

# Numbers 22:1
Then the children of Israel moved,
and camped in the plains of Moab
on the side of the Jordan across from Jericho.

# Numbers 22:2
Now Balak the son of Zippor
saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.

# Numbers 22:3
And Moab was exceedingly afraid of the people
because they were many,
and Moab was sick with dread
because of the children of Israel.

# Numbers 22:4
So Moab said to the elders of Midian,
{
  Now this company will lick up everything around us,
  as an ox licks up the grass of the field.
}

And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.

# Numbers 22:5
Then he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor,
which is near the River in the land of the sons of his people,
to call him, saying:
{
  Look, a people has come from Egypt.

  See, they cover the face of the earth,
  and are settling next to me!

# Numbers 22:6
  Therefore please come at once,
  curse this people for me,
  for they are too mighty for me.

  Perhaps I shall be able to defeat them
  and drive them out of the land,
  for I know that he whom you bless is blessed,
  and he whom you curse is cursed.
}

# Numbers 22:7
So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian
departed with the diviner's fee in their hand,
and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak.

# Numbers 22:8
And he said to them,
{
  Lodge here tonight,
  and I will bring back word to you,
  as the Lord speaks to me.
}

So the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.

# Numbers 22:9
Then God came to Balaam and said,
{
  Who are these men with you?
}

# Numbers 22:10
So Balaam said to God,
{
  Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
  has sent to me, saying,
  {
# Numbers 22:11
    Look, a people has come out of Egypt,
    and they cover the face of the earth.

    Come now, curse them for me;
    perhaps I shall be able to overpower them
    and drive them out.
  }
}

# Numbers 22:12
And God said to Balaam,
{
  You shall not go with them;
  you shall not curse the people,
  for they are blessed.
}

# Numbers 22:13
So Balaam rose in the morning and said to the princes of Balak,
{
  Go back to your land,
  for the Lord has refused to give me permission to go with you.
}

# Numbers 22:14
And the princes of Moab rose and went to Balak, and said,
{
  Balaam refuses to come with us.
}

# Numbers 22:15
Then Balak again sent princes,
more numerous and more honorable than they.

# Numbers 22:16
And they came to Balaam and said to him,
{
  Thus says Balak the son of Zippor:
  {
    Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me;
# Numbers 22:17
    for I will certainly honor you greatly,
    and I will do whatever you say to me.

    Therefore please come,
    curse this people for me.
  }
}

# Numbers 22:18
Then Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak,
{
  Though Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold,
  I could not go beyond the word of the Lord my God,
  to do less or more.

# Numbers 22:19
  Now therefore, please, you also stay here tonight,
  that I may know what more the Lord will say to me.
}

# Numbers 22:20
And God came to Balaam at night and said to him,
{
  If the men come to call you, rise and go with them;
  but only the word which I speak to you -- that you shall do.
}

# Numbers 22:21
So Balaam rose in the morning, saddled his donkey,
and went with the princes of Moab.

# Numbers 22:22
Then God's anger was aroused because he went,
and the Angel of the Lord took His stand in the way
as an adversary against him.

And he was riding on his donkey,
and his two servants were with him.

# Numbers 22:23
Now the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord
standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand,
and the donkey turned aside out of the way
and went into the field.

So Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road.

# Numbers 22:24
Then the Angel of the Lord stood in a narrow path
between the vineyards,
with a wall on this side and a wall on that side.

# Numbers 22:25
And when the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord,
she pushed herself against the wall
and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall;
so he struck her again.

# Numbers 22:26
Then the Angel of the Lord went further,
and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn
either to the right hand or to the left.

# Numbers 22:27
And when the donkey saw the Angel of the Lord,
she lay down under Balaam;
so Balaam's anger was aroused,
and he struck the donkey with his staff.

# Numbers 22:28
Then the Lord opened the mouth of the donkey,
and she said to Balaam,
{
  What have I done to you,
  that you have struck me these three times?
}

# Numbers 22:29
And Balaam said to the donkey,
{
  Because you have abused me.

  I wish there were a sword in my hand,
  for now I would kill you!
}

# Numbers 22:30
So the donkey said to Balaam,
{
  Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden,
  ever since I became yours,
  to this day?

  Was I ever disposed to do this to you?
}

And he said, "No."

# Numbers 22:31
Then the Lord opened Balaam's eyes,
and he saw the Angel of the Lord
standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand;
and he bowed his head and fell flat on his face.

# Numbers 22:32
And the Angel of the Lord said to him,
{
  Why have you struck your donkey these three times?

  Behold, I have come out to stand against you,
  because your way is perverse before Me.

# Numbers 22:33
  The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times.

# Numbers 22:34
  The donkey saw Me and turned aside from Me these three times.
  If she had not turned aside from Me,
  surely I would also have killed you by now,
  and let her live.
}

# Numbers 22:35
And Balaam said to the Angel of the Lord,
{
  I have sinned,
  for I did not know You stood in the way against me.

  Now therefore, if it displeases You, I will turn back.
}

# Numbers 22:36
Then the Angel of the Lord said to Balaam,
{
  Go with the men,
  but only the word that I speak to you,
  that you shall speak.
}

So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

# Numbers 22:37
Now when Balak heard that Balaam was coming,
he went out to meet him at the city of Moab,
which is on the border at the Arnon,
the boundary of the territory.

# Numbers 22:38
Then Balak said to Balaam,
{
  Did I not earnestly send to you, calling for you?

  Why did you not come to me?

  Am I not able to honor you?
}

# Numbers 22:39
And Balaam said to Balak,
{
  Look, I have come to you!

  Now, have I any power at all to say anything?

  The word that God puts in my mouth, that I must speak.
}

# Numbers 22:40
So Balaam went with Balak,
and they came to Kirjath Huzoth.

# Numbers 22:41
Then Balak offered oxen and sheep,
and he sent some to Balaam and to the princes who were with him.

# Numbers 22:42
So it was the next day,
that Balak took Balaam
and brought him up to the high places of Baal,
that from there he might observe the extent of the people.

# Numbers 23:1
Then Balaam said to Balak,
{
  Build seven altars for me here,
  and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.
}

# Numbers 23:2
And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken,
and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

# Numbers 23:3
Then Balaam said to Balak,
{
  Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go;
  perhaps the Lord will come to meet me,
  and whatever He shows me I will tell you.
}

So he went to a desolate height.

# Numbers 23:4
And God met Balaam,
and he said to Him,
{
  I have prepared the seven altars,
  and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
}

# Numbers 23:5
Then the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said,
{
  Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.
}

# Numbers 23:6
So he returned to him,
and there he was, standing by his burnt offering,
he and all the princes of Moab.

# Numbers 23:7
And he took up his oracle and said:
{
  Balak the king of Moab has brought me from Aram,
  From the mountains of the east.
  {
    Come, curse Jacob for me,
    And come, denounce Israel!
  }

# Numbers 23:8
  How shall I curse whom God has not cursed?

  And how shall I denounce whom the Lord has not denounced?

# Numbers 23:9
  For from the top of the rocks I see him,
  And from the hills I behold him;
  There!

  A people dwelling alone,
  Not reckoning itself among the nations.

# Numbers 23:10
  Who can count the dust of Jacob,
  Or number one-fourth of Israel?

  Let me die the death of the righteous,
  And let my end be like his!
}

# Numbers 23:11
Then Balak said to Balaam,
{
  What have you done to me?

  I took you to curse my enemies,
  and look, you have blessed them bountifully!
}

# Numbers 23:12
So he answered and said,
{
  Must I not take heed to speak
  what the Lord has put in my mouth?
}

# Numbers 23:13
Then Balak said to him,
{
  Please come with me to another place
  from which you may see them;
  you shall see only the outer part of them,
  and shall not see them all;
  curse them for me from there.
}

# Numbers 23:14
So he brought him to the field of Zophim,
to the top of Pisgah,
and built seven altars,
and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.

# Numbers 23:15
And he said to Balak,
{
  Stand here by your burnt offering
  while I meet the Lord over there.
}

# Numbers 23:16
Then the Lord met Balaam,
and put a word in his mouth, and said,
{
  Go back to Balak,
  and thus you shall speak.
}

# Numbers 23:17
So he came to him,
and there he was, standing by his burnt offering,
and the princes of Moab were with him.

And Balak said to him,
{
  What has the Lord spoken?
}

# Numbers 23:18
Then he took up his oracle and said:
{
  Rise up, Balak, and hear!

  Listen to me, son of Zippor!

# Numbers 23:19
  God is not a man, that He should lie,
  Nor a son of man, that He should repent.

  Has He said, and will He not do?

  Or has He spoken, and will He not make it good?

# Numbers 23:20
  Behold, I have received a command to bless;
  He has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.

# Numbers 23:21
  He has not observed iniquity in Jacob,
  Nor has He seen wickedness in Israel.

  The Lord his God is with him,
  And the shout of a King is among them.

# Numbers 23:22
  God brings them out of Egypt;
  He has strength like a wild ox.

# Numbers 23:23
  For there is no sorcery against Jacob,
  Nor any divination against Israel.

  It now must be said of Jacob
  And of Israel,
  {
    Oh, what God has done!
  }

# Numbers 23:24
  Look, a people rises like a lioness,
  And lifts itself up like a lion;
  It shall not lie down until it devours the prey,
  And drinks the blood of the slain.
}

# Numbers 23:25
Then Balak said to Balaam,
{
  Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all!
}

# Numbers 23:26
So Balaam answered and said to Balak,
{
  Did I not tell you, saying,
  {
    All that the Lord speaks, that I must do
  }?
}

# Numbers 23:27
Then Balak said to Balaam,
{
  Please come, I will take you to another place;
  perhaps it will please God
  that you may curse them for me from there.
}

# Numbers 23:28
So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor,
that overlooks the wasteland.

# Numbers 23:29
Then Balaam said to Balak,
{
  Build for me here seven altars,
  and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.
}

# Numbers 23:30
And Balak did as Balaam had said,
and offered a bull and a ram on every altar.

# Numbers 24:1
Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel,
he did not go as at other times,
to seek to use sorcery,
but he set his face toward the wilderness.

# Numbers 24:2
And Balaam raised his eyes,
and saw Israel encamped according to their tribes;
and the Spirit of God came upon him.

# Numbers 24:3
Then he took up his oracle and said:
{
  The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor,
  The utterance of the man whose eyes are opened,

# Numbers 24:4
  The utterance of him who hears the words of God,
  Who sees the vision of the Almighty,
  Who falls down, with eyes wide open:

# Numbers 24:5
  How lovely are your tents, O Jacob!

  Your dwellings, O Israel!

# Numbers 24:6
  Like valleys that stretch out,
  Like gardens by the riverside,
  Like aloes planted by the Lord,
  Like cedars beside the waters.

# Numbers 24:7
  He shall pour water from his buckets,
  And his seed shall be in many waters.

  His king shall be higher than Agag,
  And his kingdom shall be exalted.

# Numbers 24:8
  God brings him out of Egypt;
  He has strength like a wild ox;
  He shall consume the nations, his enemies;
  He shall break their bones
  And pierce them with his arrows.

  {
# Numbers 24:9
    He bows down, he lies down as a lion;
    And as a lion, who shall rouse him?
  }

  Blessed is he who blesses you,
  And cursed is he who curses you.
}

# Numbers 24:10
Then Balak's anger was aroused against Balaam,
and he struck his hands together;
and Balak said to Balaam,
{
  I called you to curse my enemies, and look,
  you have bountifully blessed them these three times!

# Numbers 24:11
  Now therefore, flee to your place.

  I said I would greatly honor you, but in fact,
  the Lord has kept you back from honor.
}

# Numbers 24:12
So Balaam said to Balak,
{
  Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me,
  saying,
  {
# Numbers 24:13
    If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold,
    I could not go beyond the word of the Lord,
    to do good or bad of my own will.

    What the Lord says, that I must speak
  }?

# Numbers 24:14
  And now, indeed, I am going to my people.

  Come, I will advise you what this people will do to your people
  in the latter days.
}

# Numbers 24:15
So he took up his oracle and said:
{
  The utterance of Balaam the son of Beor,
  And the utterance of the man whose eyes are opened;
# Numbers 24:16
  The utterance of him who hears the words of God,
  And has the knowledge of the Most High,
  Who sees the vision of the Almighty,
  Who falls down, with eyes wide open:

# Numbers 24:17
  I see Him, but not now;
  I behold Him, but not near;
  A Star shall come out of Jacob;
  A Scepter shall rise out of Israel,
  And batter the brow of Moab,
  And destroy all the sons of tumult.

# Numbers 24:18
  And Edom shall be a possession;
  Seir also, his enemies, shall be a possession,
  While Israel does valiantly.

# Numbers 24:19
  Out of Jacob One shall have dominion,
  And destroy the remains of the city.
}

# Numbers 24:20
Then he looked on Amalek,
and he took up his oracle and said:
{
  Amalek was first among the nations,
  But shall be last until he perishes.
}

# Numbers 24:21
Then he looked on the Kenites,
and he took up his oracle and said:
{
  Firm is your dwelling place,
  And your nest is set in the rock;

# Numbers 24:22
  Nevertheless Kain shall be burned.

  How long until Asshur carries you away captive?
}

# Numbers 24:23
Then he took up his oracle and said:
{
  Alas!

  Who shall live when God does this?

# Numbers 24:24
  But ships shall come from the coasts of Cyprus,
  And they shall afflict Asshur and afflict Eber,
  And so shall Amalek, until he perishes.
}

# Numbers 24:25
So Balaam rose and departed and returned to his place;
Balak also went his way.

# Numbers 25:1
Now Israel remained in Acacia Grove,
and the people began to commit harlotry with the women of Moab.

# Numbers 25:2
They invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods,
and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.

# Numbers 25:3
So Israel was joined to Baal of Peor,
and the anger of the Lord was aroused against Israel.

# Numbers 25:4
Then the Lord said to Moses,
{
  Take all the leaders of the people
  and hang the offenders before the Lord,
  out in the sun,
  that the fierce anger of the Lord may turn away from Israel.
}

# Numbers 25:5
So Moses said to the judges of Israel,
{
  Every one of you kill his men who were joined to Baal of Peor.
}

# Numbers 25:6
And indeed, one of the children of Israel came
and presented to his brethren a Midianite woman
in the sight of Moses
and in the sight of all the congregation
of the children of Israel,
who were weeping at the door of the tabernacle of meeting.

# Numbers 25:7
Now when Phinehas the son of Eleazar,
the son of Aaron the priest,
saw it,
he rose from among the congregation
and took a javelin in his hand;
# Numbers 25:8
and he went after the man of Israel
into the tent and thrust both of them through,
the man of Israel,
and the woman through her body.

So the plague was stopped among the children of Israel.

# Numbers 25:9
And those who died in the plague were 24,000.

# Numbers 25:10
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 25:11
  Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
  has turned back My wrath from the children of Israel,
  because he was zealous with My zeal among them,
  so that I did not consume the children of Israel in My zeal.

# Numbers 25:12
  Therefore say,
  {
    Behold, I give to him My covenant of peace;
# Numbers 25:13
    and it shall be to him and his descendants after him
    a covenant of an everlasting priesthood,
    because he was zealous for his God,
    and made atonement for the children of Israel.
  }
}

# Numbers 25:14
Now the name of the Israelite who was killed,
who was killed with the Midianite woman,
was Zimri the son of Salu,
a leader of a father's house among the Simeonites.

# Numbers 25:15
And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed
was Cozbi the daughter of Zur;
he was head of the people of a father's house in Midian.

# Numbers 25:16
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 25:17
  Harass the Midianites, and attack them;
# Numbers 25:18
  for they harassed you
  with their schemes by which they seduced you
  in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi,
  the daughter of a leader of Midian, their sister,
  who was killed in the day of the plague because of Peor.
}

# Numbers 26:1
And it came to pass, after the plague,
that the Lord spoke to Moses
and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest,
saying:
{
# Numbers 26:2
  Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel
  from 20 years old and above,
  by their fathers' houses,
  all who are able to go to war in Israel.
}

# Numbers 26:3
So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them
in the plains of Moab by the Jordan,
across from Jericho, saying:
{
# Numbers 26:4
  Take a census of the people from 20 years old and above,
  just as the Lord commanded Moses
  and the children of Israel
  who came out of the land of Egypt.
}

# Numbers 26:9
The sons of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram.

These are the Dathan and Abiram,
representatives of the congregation,
who contended against Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah,
when they contended against the Lord;
# Numbers 26:10
and the earth opened its mouth
and swallowed them up together with Korah when that company died,
when the fire devoured 250 men;
and they became a sign.

  To these the land shall be divided as an inheritance,
  according to the number of names.

# Numbers 26:54
  To a large tribe you shall give a larger inheritance,
  and to a small tribe you shall give a smaller inheritance.

  Each shall be given its inheritance
  according to those who were numbered of them.

# Numbers 26:55
  But the land shall be divided by lot;
  they shall inherit
  according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.

To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

# Numbers 26:61
And Nadab and Abihu died
when they offered profane fire before the Lord.

# Numbers 26:62
Now those who were numbered of them were 23,000,
every male from a month old and above;
for they were not numbered among the other children of Israel,
because there was no inheritance
given to them among the children of Israel.

# Numbers 26:63
These are those who were numbered
by Moses and Eleazar the priest,
who numbered the children of Israel
in the plains of Moab by the Jordan,
across from Jericho.

# Numbers 26:64
But among these there was not a man
of those who were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest
when they numbered the children of Israel
in the Wilderness of Sinai.

# Numbers 26:65
For the Lord had said of them,
{
  They shall surely die in the wilderness.
}

So there was not left a man of them,
except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.

# Numbers 27:1
Then came the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher,

and before the leaders and all the congregation,
by the doorway of the tabernacle of meeting, saying:
{
# Numbers 27:3
  Our father died in the wilderness;
  but he was not in the company of those
  who gathered together against the Lord,
  in company with Korah,
  but he died in his own sin;
  and he had no sons.

# Numbers 27:4
  Why should the name of our father be removed
  from among his family because he had no son?

  Give us a possession among our father's brothers.
}

# Numbers 27:5
So Moses brought their case before the Lord.

# Numbers 27:6
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 27:7
  The daughters of Zelophehad speak what is right;
  you shall surely give them a possession of inheritance
  among their father's brothers,
  and cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.

# Numbers 27:8
  And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying:
  {
    If a man dies and has no son,
    then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.

# Numbers 27:9
    If he has no daughter,
    then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.

# Numbers 27:10
    If he has no brothers,
    then you shall give his inheritance to his father's brothers.

# Numbers 27:11
    And if his father has no brothers,
    then you shall give his inheritance
    to the relative closest him in his family,
    and he shall possess it.
  }
}

And it shall be to the children of Israel a statute of judgment,
just as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Numbers 27:12
Now the Lord said to Moses:
{
  Go up into this Mount Abarim,
  and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.

# Numbers 27:13
  And when you have seen it,
  you also shall be gathered to your people,
  as Aaron your brother was gathered.

# Numbers 27:14
  For in the Wilderness of Zin,
  during the strife of the congregation,
  you rebelled against My command to hallow Me
  at the waters before their eyes.
}

(These are the waters of Meribah,
at Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.)

# Numbers 27:15
Then Moses spoke to the Lord, saying:
{
# Numbers 27:16
  Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh,
  set a man over the congregation,
# Numbers 27:17
  who may go out before them and go in before them,
  who may lead them out and bring them in,
  that the congregation of the Lord may not be like sheep
  which have no shepherd.
}

# Numbers 27:18
And the Lord said to Moses:
{
  Take Joshua the son of Nun with you,
  a man in whom is the Spirit,
  and lay your hand on him;
# Numbers 27:19
  set him before Eleazar the priest
  and before all the congregation,
  and inaugurate him in their sight.

# Numbers 27:20
  And you shall give some of your authority to him,
  that all the congregation of the children of Israel
  may be obedient.

# Numbers 27:21
  He shall stand before Eleazar the priest,
  who shall inquire before the Lord for him
  by the judgment of the Urim.

  At his word they shall go out,
  and at his word they shall come in,
  he and all the children of Israel with him --
  all the congregation.
}

# Numbers 27:22
So Moses did as the Lord commanded him.

He took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest
and before all the congregation.

# Numbers 27:23
And he laid his hands on him and inaugurated him,
just as the Lord commanded by the hand of Moses.

# Numbers 28:1
Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 28:2
  Command the children of Israel, and say to them,
  {
    My offering,
    My food for My offerings made by fire as a sweet aroma to Me,
    you shall be careful to offer to Me at their appointed time.
  }

# Numbers 28:3
  And you shall say to them,
  {
    This is the offering made by fire
    which you shall offer to the Lord:
      two male lambs in their first year without blemish,
      day by day, as a regular burnt offering.

# Numbers 28:4
    The one lamb you shall offer in the morning,
    the other lamb you shall offer in the evening,
# Numbers 28:5
    and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering
    mixed with one-fourth of a hin of pressed oil.

# Numbers 28:6
    It is a regular burnt offering
    which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a sweet aroma,
    an offering made by fire to the Lord.

# Numbers 28:7
    And its drink offering
    shall be one-fourth of a hin for each lamb;
    in a holy place you shall pour out the drink to the Lord
    as an offering.

# Numbers 28:8
    The other lamb you shall offer in the evening;
    as the morning grain offering and its drink offering,
    you shall offer it as an offering made by fire,
    a sweet aroma to the Lord.

# Numbers 28:9
    And on the Sabbath day two lambs in their first year,
    without blemish,
    and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering,
    mixed with oil,
    with its drink offering --
# Numbers 28:10
    this is the burnt offering for every Sabbath,
    besides the regular burnt offering with its drink offering.

# Numbers 28:11
    At the beginnings of your months
    you shall present a burnt offering to the Lord:
      two young bulls,
      one ram,
      and seven lambs in their first year,
      without blemish;
# Numbers 28:12
      three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering,
      mixed with oil,
      for each bull;
      two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering,
      mixed with oil,
      for the one ram;
# Numbers 28:13
      and one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour,
      mixed with oil,
      as a grain offering for each lamb,
      as a burnt offering of sweet aroma,
      an offering made by fire to the Lord.

# Numbers 28:14
    Their drink offering shall be half a hin of wine for a bull,
    one-third of a hin for a ram,
    and one-fourth of a hin for a lamb;
    this is the burnt offering
    for each month throughout the months of the year.

# Numbers 28:15
    Also one kid of the goats as a sin offering to the Lord
    shall be offered,
    besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.

# Numbers 28:16
    On the fourteenth day of the first month
    is the Passover of the Lord.

# Numbers 28:17
    And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast;
    unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days.

# Numbers 28:18
    On the first day you shall have a holy convocation.

    You shall do no customary work.

# Numbers 28:19
    And you shall present an offering made by fire

      two young bulls,
      one ram,
      and seven lambs in their first year.

    Be sure they are without blemish.

# Numbers 28:20
    Their grain offering shall be of fine flour mixed with oil:
      three-tenths of an ephah you shall offer for a bull,
      and two-tenths for a ram;
# Numbers 28:21
      you shall offer one-tenth of an ephah
      for each of the seven lambs;
# Numbers 28:22
      also one goat as a sin offering,
      to make atonement for you.

# Numbers 28:23
    You shall offer these
    besides the burnt offering of the morning,
    which is for a regular burnt offering.

# Numbers 28:24
    In this manner you shall offer the food of the offering
    made by fire daily for seven days,
    as a sweet aroma to the Lord;
    it shall be offered
    besides the regular burnt offering and its drink offering.

# Numbers 28:25
    And on the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation.

    You shall do no customary work.

# Numbers 28:26
    Also on the day of the firstfruits,
    when you bring a new grain offering
    to the Lord
    at your Feast of Weeks,
    you shall have a holy convocation.

    You shall do no customary work.

# Numbers 28:27
    You shall present a burnt offering

    Be sure they are without blemish.

    You shall present them with their drink offerings,
    besides the regular burnt offering with its grain offering.

      the regular burnt offering with its grain offering,
      and their drink offerings,
      according to their ordinance,
      as a sweet aroma,
      an offering made by fire to the Lord.

    You shall present a burnt offering to the Lord
    as a sweet aroma:

  }
}

# Numbers 29:40
So Moses told the children of Israel everything,
just as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Numbers 30:1
Then Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes
concerning the children of Israel,
saying,
{
  This is the thing which the Lord has commanded:

# Numbers 30:2
  If a man makes a vow to the Lord,
  or swears an oath to bind himself by some agreement,
  he shall not break his word;
  he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.

# Numbers 30:3
  Or if a woman makes a vow to the Lord,
  and binds herself by some agreement
  while in her father's house in her youth,
# Numbers 30:4
  and her father hears her vow
  and the agreement by which she has bound herself,
  and her father holds his peace,
  then all her vows shall stand,
  and every agreement with which she has bound herself
  shall stand.

# Numbers 30:5
  But if her father overrules her on the day that he hears,
  then none of her vows nor her agreements
  by which she has bound herself shall stand;
  and the Lord will release her,
  because her father overruled her.

# Numbers 30:6
  If indeed she takes a husband,
  while bound by her vows
  or by a rash utterance from her lips
  by which she bound herself,
# Numbers 30:7
  and her husband hears it,
  and makes no response to her on the day that he hears,
  then her vows shall stand,
  and her agreements by which she bound herself shall stand.

# Numbers 30:8
  But if her husband overrules her
  on the day that he hears it,
  he shall make void her vow which she took
  and what she uttered with her lips,
  by which she bound herself,
  and the Lord will release her.

# Numbers 30:9
  Also any vow of a widow or a divorced woman,
  by which she has bound herself,
  shall stand against her.

# Numbers 30:10
  If she vowed in her husband's house,
  or bound herself by an agreement with an oath,
# Numbers 30:11
  and her husband heard it,
  and made no response to her and did not overrule her,
  then all her vows shall stand,
  and every agreement by which she bound herself shall stand.

# Numbers 30:12
  But if her husband truly made them void
  on the day he heard them,
  then whatever proceeded from her lips concerning her vows
  or concerning the agreement binding her,
  it shall not stand;
  her husband has made them void,
  and the Lord will release her.

# Numbers 30:13
  Every vow and every binding oath to afflict her soul,
  her husband may confirm it,
  or her husband may make it void.

# Numbers 30:14
  Now if her husband makes no response whatever to her
  from day to day,
  then he confirms all her vows
  or all the agreements that bind her;
  he confirms them,
  because he made no response to her
  on the day that he heard them.

# Numbers 30:15
  But if he does make them void after he has heard them,
  then he shall bear her guilt.
}

# Numbers 30:16
These are the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses,
between a man and his wife,
and between a father and his daughter in her youth
in her father's house.

# Numbers 31:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 31:2
  Take vengeance on the Midianites for the children of Israel.

  Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.
}

# Numbers 31:3
So Moses spoke to the people, saying,
{
  Arm some of yourselves for war,
  and let them go against the Midianites
  to take vengeance for the Lord on Midian.

# Numbers 31:4
  A thousand from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel
  you shall send to the war.
}

# Numbers 31:5
So there were recruited from the divisions of Israel
 1,000 from each tribe,
12,000 armed for war.

# Numbers 31:6
Then Moses sent them to the war, 1,000 from each tribe;
he sent them to the war with Phinehas
the son of Eleazar the priest,
with the holy articles and the signal trumpets in his hand.

# Numbers 31:7
And they warred against the Midianites,
just as the Lord commanded Moses,
and they killed all the males.

# Numbers 31:8
They killed the kings of Midian
with the rest of those who were killed --
Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian.

Balaam the son of Beor they also killed with the sword.

# Numbers 31:9
And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captive,
with their little ones,
and took as spoil all their cattle,
all their flocks,
and all their goods.

# Numbers 31:10
They also burned with fire all the cities where they dwelt,
and all their forts.

# Numbers 31:11
And they took all the spoil and all the booty -- of man and beast.

# Numbers 31:12
Then they brought the captives, the booty, and the spoil to Moses,
to Eleazar the priest,
and to the congregation of the children of Israel,
to the camp in the plains of Moab by the Jordan,
across from Jericho.

# Numbers 31:13
And Moses, Eleazar the priest,
and all the leaders of the congregation,
went to meet them outside the camp.

# Numbers 31:14
But Moses was angry with the officers of the army,
with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds,
who had come from the battle.

# Numbers 31:15
And Moses said to them:
{
  Have you kept all the women alive?

# Numbers 31:16
  Look, these women caused the children of Israel,
  through the counsel of Balaam,
  to trespass against the Lord in the incident of Peor,
  and there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord.

# Numbers 31:17
  Now therefore, kill every male among the little ones,
  and kill every woman who has known a man intimately.

# Numbers 31:18
  But keep alive for yourselves all the young girls
  who have not known a man intimately.

# Numbers 31:19
  And as for you, remain outside the camp seven days;
  whoever has killed any person,
  and whoever has touched any slain,
  purify yourselves and your captives
  on the third day and on the seventh day.

# Numbers 31:20
  Purify every garment,
  everything made of leather,
  everything woven of goats' hair,
  and everything made of wood.
}

# Numbers 31:21
Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war
who had gone to the battle,
{
  This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded Moses:

# Numbers 31:22
  Only the gold,
  the silver,
  the bronze,
  the iron,
  the tin,
  and the lead,
# Numbers 31:23
  everything that can endure fire,
  you shall put through the fire,
  and it shall be clean;
  and it shall be purified with the water of purification.

  But all that cannot endure fire you shall put through water.

# Numbers 31:24
  And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean,
  and afterward you may come into the camp.
}

# Numbers 31:25
Now the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
{
# Numbers 31:26
  Count up the plunder that was taken -- of man and beast --
  you and Eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation;
# Numbers 31:27
  and divide the plunder into two parts,
  between those who took part in the war,
  who went out to battle,
  and all the congregation.

# Numbers 31:28
  And levy a tribute for the Lord
  on the men of war who went out to battle:
    one of every 500 of the persons,
    the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep;
# Numbers 31:29
    take it from their half,
    and give it to Eleazar the priest
    as a heave offering to the Lord.

# Numbers 31:30
  And from the children of Israel's half
  you shall take one of every 50,
  drawn from the persons,
  the cattle, the donkeys, and the sheep, from all the livestock,
  and give them to the Levites
  who keep charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.
}

# Numbers 31:31
So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Numbers 31:32
The booty remaining from the plunder,
which the men of war had taken,
was 675,000 sheep,
# Numbers 31:33
72,000 cattle,
# Numbers 31:34
61,000 donkeys,
# Numbers 31:35
and 32,000 persons in all,
of women who had not known a man intimately.

# Numbers 31:36
And the half, the portion for those who had gone out to war,
was in number 337,500 sheep;
# Numbers 31:37
and the Lord's tribute of the sheep was 675.

# Numbers 31:38
The cattle were 36,000,
of which the Lord's tribute was 72.

# Numbers 31:39
The donkeys were 30,500,
of which the Lord's tribute was 61.

# Numbers 31:40
The persons were 16,000,
of which the Lord's tribute was 32 persons.

# Numbers 31:41
So Moses gave the tribute which was the Lord's heave offering
to Eleazar the priest,
as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Numbers 31:42
And from the children of Israel's half,
which Moses separated from the men who fought --
# Numbers 31:43
now the half belonging to the congregation was 337,500 sheep,
# Numbers 31:44
36,000 cattle,
# Numbers 31:45
30,500 donkeys,
# Numbers 31:46
and 16,000 persons --
# Numbers 31:47
and from the children of Israel's half Moses took one of every 50,
drawn from man and beast,
and gave them to the Levites,
who kept charge of the tabernacle of the Lord,
as the Lord commanded Moses.

# Numbers 31:48
Then the officers who were over thousands of the army,
the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
came near to Moses;
# Numbers 31:49
and they said to Moses,
{
  Your servants have taken a count of the men of war
  who are under our command,
  and not a man of us is missing.

# Numbers 31:50
  Therefore we have brought an offering for the Lord,
  what every man found of ornaments of gold:
    armlets
    and bracelets
    and signet rings
    and earrings
    and necklaces,
    to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord.
}

# Numbers 31:51
So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from them,
all the fashioned ornaments.

# Numbers 31:52
And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the Lord,
from the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,
was 16,750 shekels.

# Numbers 31:53
(The men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

# Numbers 31:54
And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold
from the captains of thousands and of hundreds,
and brought it into the tabernacle of meeting
as a memorial for the children of Israel
before the Lord.

# Numbers 32:1
Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
had a very great multitude of livestock;
and when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead,
that indeed the region was a place for livestock,
# Numbers 32:2
the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses,
to Eleazar the priest,
and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,
{
# Numbers 32:3
  Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Shebam, Nebo,
  and Beon,
# Numbers 32:4
  the country which the Lord defeated
  before the congregation of Israel,
  is a land for livestock,
  and your servants have livestock.
}

# Numbers 32:5
Therefore they said,
{
  If we have found favor in your sight,
  let this land be given to your servants as a possession.

  Do not take us over the Jordan.
}

# Numbers 32:6
And Moses said to the children of Gad
and to the children of Reuben:
{
  Shall your brethren go to war while you sit here?

# Numbers 32:7
  Now why will you discourage the heart of the children of Israel
  from going over into the land which the Lord has given them?

# Numbers 32:8
  Thus your fathers did when I sent them away from Kadesh Barnea
  to see the land.

# Numbers 32:9
  For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land,
  they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel,
  so that they did not go into the land
  which the Lord had given them.

# Numbers 32:10
  So the Lord's anger was aroused on that day,
  and He swore an oath, saying,
  {
    Surely none of the men who came up from Egypt,
    from 20 years old and above,
    shall see the land of which I swore
    to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
    because they have not wholly followed Me,
# Numbers 32:11
    except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, the Kenizzite,
    and Joshua the son of Nun,
    for they have wholly followed the Lord.
  }

# Numbers 32:12
  So the Lord's anger was aroused against Israel,
  and He made them wander in the wilderness 40 years,
  until all the generation that had done evil
  in the sight of the Lord was gone.

# Numbers 32:13
  And look!

  You have risen in your father's place,
  a brood of sinful men,
  to increase still more the fierce anger of the Lord
  against Israel.

# Numbers 32:14
  For if you turn away from following Him,
  He will once again leave them in the wilderness,
  and you will destroy all these people.
}

# Numbers 32:15
Then they came near to him and said:
{
  We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock,
  and cities for our little ones,
# Numbers 32:16
  but we ourselves will be armed,
  ready to go before the children of Israel
  until we have brought them to their place;
  and our little ones will dwell in the fortified cities
  because of the inhabitants of the land.

# Numbers 32:17
  We will not return to our homes
  until every one of the children of Israel
  has received his inheritance.

# Numbers 32:18
  For we will not inherit with them
  on the other side of the Jordan and beyond,
  because our inheritance has fallen to us
  on this eastern side of the Jordan.
}

# Numbers 32:19
Then Moses said to them:
{
  If you do this thing,
  if you arm yourselves before the Lord for the war,
# Numbers 32:20
  and all your armed men cross over the Jordan before the Lord
  until He has driven out His enemies from before Him,
# Numbers 32:21
  and the land is subdued before the Lord,
  then afterward you may return and be blameless
  before the Lord and before Israel;
  and this land shall be your possession before the Lord.

# Numbers 32:22
  But if you do not do so,
  then take note, you have sinned against the Lord;
  and be sure your sin will find you out.

# Numbers 32:23
  Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep,
  and do what has proceeded out of your mouth.
}

# Numbers 32:24
And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses,
saying:
{
  Your servants will do as my lord commands.

# Numbers 32:25
  Our little ones,
  our wives,
  our flocks,
  and all our livestock will be there in the cities of Gilead;
# Numbers 32:26
  but your servants will cross over,
  every man armed for war,
  before the Lord to battle,
  just as my lord says.
}

# Numbers 32:27
So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest,
to Joshua the son of Nun,
and to the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel.

# Numbers 32:28
And Moses said to them:
{
  If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben
  cross over the Jordan with you,
  every man armed for battle before the Lord,
  and the land is subdued before you,
  then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession.

# Numbers 32:29
  But if they do not cross over armed with you,
  they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
}

# Numbers 32:30
Then the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
saying:
{
  As the Lord has said to your servants, so we will do.

# Numbers 32:31
  We will cross over armed before the Lord
  into the land of Canaan,
  but the possession of our inheritance
  shall remain with us on this side of the Jordan.
}

# Numbers 32:32
So Moses gave to the children of Gad,
to the children of Reuben,
and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph,
the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites
and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan,
the land with its cities within the borders,
the cities of the surrounding country.

# Numbers 32:33
And the children of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer,
# Numbers 32:34
Atroth and Shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah,
# Numbers 32:35
Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran,
fortified cities,
and folds for sheep.

# Numbers 32:36
And the children of Reuben
built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kirjathaim,
# Numbers 32:37
Nebo and Baal Meon (their names being changed) and Shibmah;
and they gave other names to the cities which they built.

# Numbers 32:38
And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh
went to Gilead and took it,
and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.

# Numbers 32:39
So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh,
and he dwelt in it.

# Numbers 32:40
Also Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns,
and called them Havoth Jair.

# Numbers 32:41
Then Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages,
and he called it Nobah, after his own name.

# Numbers 33:1
These are the journeys of the children of Israel,
who went out of the land of Egypt by their armies
under the hand of Moses and Aaron.

# Numbers 33:2
Now Moses wrote down the starting points of their journeys
at the command of the Lord.

And these are their journeys according to their starting points:

# Numbers 33:3
They departed from Rameses in the first month,
on the fifteenth day of the first month;
on the day after the Passover
the children of Israel went out with boldness
in the sight of all the Egyptians.

# Numbers 33:4
For the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn,
whom the Lord had killed among them.

Also on their gods the Lord had executed judgments.

# Numbers 33:5
Then the children of Israel moved from Rameses
and camped at Succoth.

# Numbers 33:6
They departed from Succoth and camped at Etham,
which is on the edge of the wilderness.

# Numbers 33:7
They moved from Etham and turned back to Pi Hahiroth,
which is east of Baal Zephon;
and they camped near Migdol.

# Numbers 33:8
They departed from before Hahiroth
and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness,
went three days' journey in the Wilderness of Etham,
and camped at Marah.

# Numbers 33:9
They moved from Marah and came to Elim.

At Elim were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees;
so they camped there.

# Numbers 33:10
They moved from Elim and camped by the Red Sea.

# Numbers 33:11
They moved from the Red Sea
and camped in the Wilderness of Sin.

# Numbers 33:12
They journeyed from the Wilderness of Sin
and camped at Dophkah.

# Numbers 33:13
They departed from Dophkah and camped at Alush.

# Numbers 33:14
They moved from Alush and camped at Rephidim,
where there was no water
for the people to drink.

# Numbers 33:15
They departed from Rephidim
and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai.

# Numbers 33:16
They moved from the Wilderness of Sinai
and camped at Kibroth Hattaavah.

# Numbers 33:17
They departed from Kibroth Hattaavah
and camped at Hazeroth.

# Numbers 33:18
They departed from Hazeroth
and camped at Rithmah.

# Numbers 33:19
They departed from Rithmah
and camped at Rimmon Perez.

# Numbers 33:20
They departed from Rimmon Perez
and camped at Libnah.

# Numbers 33:21
They moved from Libnah
and camped at Rissah.

# Numbers 33:22
They journeyed from Rissah
and camped at Kehelathah.

# Numbers 33:23
They went from Kehelathah
and camped at Mount Shepher.

# Numbers 33:24
They moved from Mount Shepher
and camped at Haradah.

# Numbers 33:25
They moved from Haradah
and camped at Makheloth.

# Numbers 33:26
They moved from Makheloth
and camped at Tahath.

# Numbers 33:27
They departed from Tahath
and camped at Terah.

# Numbers 33:28
They moved from Terah
and camped at Mithkah.

# Numbers 33:29
They went from Mithkah
and camped at Hashmonah.

# Numbers 33:30
They departed from Hashmonah
and camped at Moseroth.

# Numbers 33:31
They departed from Moseroth
and camped at Bene Jaakan.

# Numbers 33:32
They moved from Bene Jaakan
and camped at Hor Hagidgad.

# Numbers 33:33
They went from Hor Hagidgad
and camped at Jotbathah.

# Numbers 33:34
They moved from Jotbathah
and camped at Abronah.

# Numbers 33:35
They departed from Abronah
and camped at Ezion Geber.

# Numbers 33:36
They moved from Ezion Geber
and camped in the Wilderness of Zin,
which is Kadesh.

# Numbers 33:37
They moved from Kadesh
and camped at Mount Hor,
on the boundary of the land of Edom.

# Numbers 33:38
Then Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor
at the command of the Lord,
and died there in the fortieth year
after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt,
on the first day of the fifth month.

# Numbers 33:39
Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor.

# Numbers 33:40
Now the king of Arad, the Canaanite,
who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan,
heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

# Numbers 33:41
So they departed from Mount Hor
and camped at Zalmonah.

# Numbers 33:42
They departed from Zalmonah
and camped at Punon.

# Numbers 33:43
They departed from Punon
and camped at Oboth.

# Numbers 33:44
They departed from Oboth
and camped at Ije Abarim, at the border of Moab.

# Numbers 33:45
They departed from Ijim
and camped at Dibon Gad.

# Numbers 33:46
They moved from Dibon Gad
and camped at Almon Diblathaim.

# Numbers 33:47
They moved from Almon Diblathaim
and camped in the mountains of Abarim,
before Nebo.

# Numbers 33:48
They departed from the mountains of Abarim
and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan,
across from Jericho.

# Numbers 33:49
They camped by the Jordan,
from Beth Jesimoth
as far as the Abel Acacia Grove in the plains of Moab.

# Numbers 33:50
Now the Lord spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan,
across from Jericho, saying,

{
# Numbers 33:51
  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:
  {
    When you have crossed the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
# Numbers 33:52
    then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land
    from before you,
    destroy all their engraved stones,
    destroy all their molded images,
    and demolish all their high places;
# Numbers 33:53
    you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land
    and dwell in it,
    for I have given you the land to possess.

# Numbers 33:54
    And you shall divide the land by lot
    as an inheritance among your families;
    to the larger you shall give a larger inheritance,
    and to the smaller you shall give a smaller inheritance;
    there everyone's inheritance
    shall be whatever falls to him by lot.

    You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers.

# Numbers 33:55
    But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land
    from before you,
    then it shall be that those whom you let remain
    shall be irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides,
    and they shall harass you in the land where you dwell.

# Numbers 33:56
    Moreover it shall be that I will do to you
    as I thought to do to them.
  }
}

# Numbers 34:1
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 34:2
  Command the children of Israel, and say to them:
  {
    When you come into the land of Canaan,
    this is the land that shall fall to you as an inheritance --
    the land of Canaan to its boundaries.

# Numbers 34:3
    Your southern border shall be
    from the Wilderness of Zin along the border of Edom;
    then your southern border shall extend eastward
    to the end of the Salt Sea;
# Numbers 34:4
    your border shall turn
    from the southern side of the Ascent of Akrabbim,
    continue to Zin,
    and be on the south of Kadesh Barnea;
    then it shall go on to Hazar Addar,
    and continue to Azmon;
# Numbers 34:5
    the border shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt,
    and it shall end at the Sea.

# Numbers 34:6
    As for the western border,
    you shall have the Great Sea for a border;
    this shall be your western border.

# Numbers 34:7
    And this shall be your northern border:
      From the Great Sea
      you shall mark out your border line to Mount Hor;
# Numbers 34:8
      from Mount Hor
      you shall mark out your border to the entrance of Hamath;
      then the direction of the border shall be toward Zedad;
# Numbers 34:9
      the border shall proceed to Ziphron,
      and it shall end at Hazar Enan.

    This shall be your northern border.

# Numbers 34:10
    You shall mark out your eastern border
    from Hazar Enan to Shepham;
# Numbers 34:11
    the border shall go down from Shepham
    to Riblah on the east side of Ain;
    the border shall go down and reach
    to the eastern side of the Sea of Chinnereth;
# Numbers 34:12
    the border shall go down along the Jordan,
    and it shall end at the Salt Sea.

    This shall be your land with its surrounding boundaries.
  }
}

# Numbers 34:13
Then Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying:
{
  This is the land which you shall inherit by lot,
  which the Lord has commanded to give
  to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe.

# Numbers 34:14
  For the tribe of the children of Reuben
  according to the house of their fathers,
  and the tribe of the children of Gad
  according to the house of their fathers,
  have received their inheritance;
  and the half-tribe of Manasseh
  has received its inheritance.

# Numbers 34:15
  The two tribes and the half-tribe
  have received their inheritance
  on this side of the Jordan,
  across from Jericho eastward,
  toward the sunrise.
}

# Numbers 34:16
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 34:17
  These are the names of the men
  who shall divide the land among you
  as an inheritance:
    Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.

# Numbers 34:18
  And you shall take one leader of every tribe
  to divide the land for the inheritance.

# Numbers 34:19
  These are the names of the men:
    from the tribe of Judah,
    Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
# Numbers 34:20
    from the tribe of the children of Simeon,
    Shemuel the son of Ammihud;
# Numbers 34:21
    from the tribe of Benjamin,
    Elidad the son of Chislon;
# Numbers 34:22
    a leader from the tribe of the children of Dan,
    Bukki the son of Jogli;
# Numbers 34:23
  from the sons of Joseph:
    a leader from the tribe of the children of Manasseh,
    Hanniel the son of Ephod,
# Numbers 34:24
    and a leader from the tribe of the children of Ephraim,
    Kemuel the son of Shiphtan;
# Numbers 34:25
    a leader from the tribe of the children of Zebulun,
    Elizaphan the son of Parnach;
# Numbers 34:26
    a leader from the tribe of the children of Issachar,
    Paltiel the son of Azzan;
# Numbers 34:27
    a leader from the tribe of the children of Asher,
    Ahihud the son of Shelomi;
# Numbers 34:28
    and a leader from the tribe of the children of Naphtali,
    Pedahel the son of Ammihud.
}

# Numbers 34:29
These are the ones the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance
among the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

# Numbers 35:1
And the Lord spoke to Moses
in the plains of Moab
by the Jordan
across from Jericho,
saying:
{
# Numbers 35:2
  Command the children of Israel
  that they give the Levites cities to dwell in
  from the inheritance of their possession,
  and you shall also give the Levites common-land
  around the cities.

# Numbers 35:3
  They shall have the cities to dwell in;
  and their common-land shall be for their cattle,
  for their herds,
  and for all their animals.

# Numbers 35:4
  The common-land of the cities which you shall give the Levites
  shall extend from the wall of the city
  outward 1000 cubits all around.

# Numbers 35:5
  And you shall measure outside the city
  on the east side 2000 cubits,
  on the south side two thousand cubits,
  on the west side two thousand cubits,
  and on the north side two thousand cubits.

  The city shall be in the middle.

  This shall belong to them as common-land for the cities.

# Numbers 35:6
  Now among the cities which you will give to the Levites
  you shall appoint six cities of refuge,
  to which a manslayer may flee.

  And to these you shall add 42 cities.

# Numbers 35:7
  So all the cities you will give to the Levites shall be 48;
  these you shall give with their common-land.

# Numbers 35:8
  And the cities which you will give
  shall be from the possession of the children of Israel;
  from the larger tribe you shall give many,
  from the smaller you shall give few.

  Each shall give some of its cities to the Levites,
  in proportion to the inheritance that each receives.
}

# Numbers 35:9
Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
{
# Numbers 35:10
  Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them:
  {
    When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
# Numbers 35:11
    then you shall appoint cities to be cities of refuge for you,
    that the manslayer who kills any person accidentally
    may flee there.

# Numbers 35:12
    They shall be cities of refuge for you from the avenger,
    that the manslayer may not die
    until he stands before the congregation in judgment.

# Numbers 35:13
    And of the cities which you give,
    you shall have six cities of refuge.

# Numbers 35:14
    You shall appoint three cities on this side of the Jordan,
    and three cities you shall appoint in the land of Canaan,
    which will be cities of refuge.

# Numbers 35:15
    These six cities shall be for refuge
    for the children of Israel,
    for the stranger,
    and for the sojourner among them,
    that anyone who kills a person accidentally may flee there.

# Numbers 35:16
    But if he strikes him with an iron implement,
    so that he dies,
    he is a murderer;
    the murderer shall surely be put to death.

# Numbers 35:17
    And if he strikes him with a stone in the hand,
    by which one could die,
    and he does die,
    he is a murderer;
    the murderer shall surely be put to death.

# Numbers 35:18
    Or if he strikes him with a wooden hand weapon,
    by which one could die,
    and he does die,
    he is a murderer;
    the murderer shall surely be put to death.

# Numbers 35:19
    The avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death;
    when he meets him,
    he shall put him to death.

# Numbers 35:20
    If he pushes him out of hatred or,
    while lying in wait,
    hurls something at him so that he dies,
# Numbers 35:21
    or in enmity he strikes him with his hand so that he dies,
    the one who struck him shall surely be put to death.

    He is a murderer.

    The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death
    when he meets him.

# Numbers 35:22
    However, if he pushes him suddenly without enmity,
    or throws anything at him without lying in wait,
# Numbers 35:23
    or uses a stone,
    by which a man could die,
    throwing it at him without seeing him,
    so that he dies,
    while he was not his enemy or seeking his harm,
# Numbers 35:24
    then the congregation shall judge
    between the manslayer and the avenger of blood
    according to these judgments.

# Numbers 35:25
    So the congregation shall deliver the manslayer
    from the hand of the avenger of blood,
    and the congregation shall return him
    to the city of refuge where he had fled,
    and he shall remain there
    until the death of the high priest
    who was anointed with the holy oil.

# Numbers 35:26
    But if the manslayer at any time
    goes outside the limits of the city of refuge where he fled,
# Numbers 35:27
    and the avenger of blood finds him
    outside the limits of his city of refuge,
    and the avenger of blood kills the manslayer,
    he shall not be guilty of blood,
# Numbers 35:28
    because he should have remained in his city of refuge
    until the death of the high priest.

    But after the death of the high priest
    the manslayer may return to the land of his possession.

# Numbers 35:29
    And these things shall be a statute of judgment to you
    throughout your generations
    in all your dwellings.

# Numbers 35:30
    Whoever kills a person,
    the murderer shall be put to death
    on the testimony of witnesses;
    but one witness is not sufficient testimony
    against a person
    for the death penalty.

# Numbers 35:31
    Moreover you shall take no ransom
    for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death,
    but he shall surely be put to death.

# Numbers 35:32
    And you shall take no ransom
    for him who has fled to his city of refuge,
    that he may return to dwell in the land
    before the death of the priest.

# Numbers 35:33
    So you shall not pollute the land where you are;
    for blood defiles the land,
    and no atonement can be made for the land,
    for the blood that is shed on it,
    except by the blood of him who shed it.

# Numbers 35:34
    Therefore do not defile the land which you inhabit,
    in the midst of which I dwell;
    for I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel.
  }
}

# Numbers 36:1
Now the chief fathers of the families
of the children of Gilead the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,
of the families of the sons of Joseph,
came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders,
the chief fathers of the children of Israel.

# Numbers 36:2
And they said:
{
  The Lord commanded my lord Moses
  to give the land as an inheritance by lot
  to the children of Israel,
  and my lord was commanded by the Lord
  to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad
  to his daughters.

# Numbers 36:3
  Now if they are married to any of the sons
  of the other tribes of the children of Israel,
  then their inheritance will be taken
  from the inheritance of our fathers,
  and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe
  into which they marry;
  so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

# Numbers 36:4
  And when the Jubilee of the children of Israel comes,
  then their inheritance will be added
  to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry;
  so their inheritance will be taken away
  from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
}

# Numbers 36:5
Then Moses commanded the children of Israel
according to the word of the Lord,
saying:
{
  What the tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks is right.

# Numbers 36:6
  This is what the Lord commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad,
  saying,
  {
    Let them marry whom they think best,
    but they may marry only
    within the family of their father's tribe.
  }

# Numbers 36:7
  So the inheritance of the children of Israel
  shall not change hands from tribe to tribe,
  for every one of the children of Israel
  shall keep the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

# Numbers 36:8
  And every daughter who possesses an inheritance
  in any tribe of the children of Israel
  shall be the wife of one of the family of her father's tribe,
  so that the children of Israel
  each may possess the inheritance of his fathers.

# Numbers 36:9
  Thus no inheritance shall change hands
  from one tribe to another,
  but every tribe of the children of Israel
  shall keep its own inheritance.
}

# Numbers 36:10
Just as the Lord commanded Moses,
so did the daughters of Zelophehad;
# Numbers 36:11
for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah,
the daughters of Zelophehad,
were married to the sons of their father's brothers.

# Numbers 36:12
They were married into the families of the children of Manasseh
the son of Joseph,
and their inheritance remained
in the tribe of their father's family.

# Numbers 36:13
These are the commandments and the judgments
which the Lord commanded the children of Israel
by the hand of Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan,
across from Jericho.
