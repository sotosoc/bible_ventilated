# Psalms 1:1
Blessed is the man
Who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly,
Nor stands in the path of sinners,
Nor sits in the seat of the scornful;

# Psalms 1:2
But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
And in His law he meditates day and night.

# Psalms 1:3
He shall be like a tree
Planted by the rivers of water,
That brings forth its fruit in its season,
Whose leaf also shall not wither;
And whatever he does shall prosper.

But are like the chaff which the wind drives away.

Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

But the way of the ungodly shall perish.

Why do the nations rage,
And the people plot a vain thing?

Against the Lord and against His Anointed,
saying,

  Let us break their bonds in pieces
  And cast away their cords from us.
}

# Psalms 2:4
He who sits in the heavens shall laugh;
The Lord shall hold them in derision.

# Psalms 2:5

And distress them in His deep displeasure:
{

  Yet I have set My King
  On My holy hill of Zion.
}

{
# Psalms 2:7
  I will declare the decree:
  The Lord has said to Me,
  {
    You are My Son,
    Today I have begotten You.

# Psalms 2:8
    Ask of Me, and I will give You
    The nations for Your inheritance,
    And the ends of the earth for Your possession.

# Psalms 2:9
    You shall break them with a rod of iron;
    You shall dash them to pieces like a potter's vessel.

Now therefore, be wise, O kings;
Be instructed, you judges of the earth.

# Psalms 2:11
Serve the Lord with fear,

And you perish in the way,
When His wrath is kindled but a little.

who put their trust in Him.

Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies;

Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions,

When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,
The moon and the stars, which You have ordained,

# Psalms 8:4
What is man that You are mindful of him,
And the son of man that You visit him?

# Psalms 8:5
For You have made him a little lower than the angels,
And You have crowned him with glory and honor.

# Psalms 8:6
You have made him to have dominion over the works of Your hands;
You have put all things under his feet,

That pass through the paths of the seas.

You have rebuked the nations,
You have destroyed the wicked;
You have blotted out their name forever and ever.

He blesses the greedy and renounces the Lord.

# Psalms 10:4
The wicked in his proud countenance does not seek God;
God is in none of his thoughts.

# Psalms 10:5
His ways are always prospering;
Your judgments are far above, out of his sight;
As for all his enemies, he sneers at them.

# Psalms 10:6
He has said in his heart,
{
  I shall not be moved;
  I shall never be in adversity.

# Psalms 10:7
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression;

He sits in the lurking places of the villages;
In the secret places he murders the innocent;

# Psalms 10:9
He lies in wait secretly, as a lion in his den;
He lies in wait to catch the poor;
He catches the poor when he draws him into his net.

# Psalms 10:10
So he crouches, he lies low,
That the helpless may fall by his strength.

He has said in his heart,
{
  God has forgotten;
  He hides His face;
  He will never see.

Arise, O Lord!

O God, lift up Your hand!

Do not forget the humble.

He has said in his heart,
{
  You will not require an account.

Seek out his wickedness until You find none.

May the Lord cut off all flattering lips,
And the tongue that speaks proud things,

# Psalms 12:4
Who have said,
{
  With our tongue we will prevail;
  Our lips are our own;
  Who is lord over us?
}

Having sorrow in my heart daily?

How long will my enemy be exalted over me?

Consider and hear me, O Lord my God;

The Lord looks down from heaven upon the children of men,
To see if there are any who understand, who seek God.

And do not call on the Lord?

He who walks uprightly,
And works righteousness,
And speaks the truth in his heart;
# Psalms 15:3
He who does not backbite with his tongue,
Nor does evil to his neighbor,
Nor does he take up a reproach against his friend;
# Psalms 15:4
In whose eyes a vile person is despised,
But he honors those who fear the Lord;
He who swears to his own hurt and does not change;

He who does not put out his money at usury,
Nor does he take a bribe against the innocent.

He who does these things shall never be moved.

Let my vindication come from Your presence;
Let Your eyes look on the things that are upright.

# Psalms 17:9
From the wicked who oppress me,
From my deadly enemies who surround me.

# Psalms 17:10
They have closed up their fat hearts;
With their mouths they speak proudly.

# Psalms 17:11
They have now surrounded us in our steps;
They have set their eyes,
  crouching down to the earth,
# Psalms 17:12
As a lion is eager to tear his prey,
And like a young lion lurking in secret places.

# Psalms 17:13
Arise, O Lord,
Confront him, cast him down;
Deliver my life from the wicked with Your sword,
# Psalms 17:14

In my distress I called upon the Lord,
And cried out to my God;
He heard my voice from His temple,
And my cry came before Him, even to His ears.

# Psalms 18:7
Then the earth shook and trembled;
The foundations of the hills also quaked and were shaken,
Because He was angry.

# Psalms 18:8
Smoke went up from His nostrils,
And devouring fire from His mouth;
Coals were kindled by it.

# Psalms 18:9
He bowed the heavens also, and came down
With darkness under His feet.

# Psalms 18:10
And He rode upon a cherub, and flew;
He flew upon the wings of the wind.

# Psalms 18:11
He made darkness His secret place;
His canopy around Him was dark waters
And thick clouds of the skies.

# Psalms 18:12
From the brightness before Him,
His thick clouds passed with hailstones and coals of fire.

# Psalms 18:13
The Lord thundered from heaven,
And the Most High uttered His voice,
Hailstones and coals of fire.

Then the channels of the sea were seen,
The foundations of the world were uncovered
At Your rebuke, O Lord,
At the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.

# Psalms 18:16
He sent from above,
He took me;
He drew me out of many waters.

# Psalms 18:17
He delivered me from my strong enemy,
From those who hated me,
For they were too strong for me.

# Psalms 18:18
They confronted me in the day of my calamity,
But the Lord was my support.

# Psalms 18:19
He also brought me out into a broad place;
He delivered me because He delighted in me.

# Psalms 18:20
The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness;
According to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.

# Psalms 18:21
For I have kept the ways of the Lord,
And have not wickedly departed from my God.

# Psalms 18:22
For all His judgments were before me,
And I did not put away His statutes from me.

# Psalms 18:23
I was also blameless before Him,
And I kept myself from my iniquity.

Therefore the Lord has recompensed me according to my righteousness,
According to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.

# Psalms 18:25
With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful;
With a blameless man You will show Yourself blameless;
# Psalms 18:26
With the pure You will show Yourself pure;
And with the devious You will show Yourself shrewd.

For You will save the humble people,
But will bring down haughty looks.

For You will light my lamp;
The Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.

For by You I can run against a troop,
By my God I can leap over a wall.

But joy comes in the morning.

# Psalms 30:6
Now in my prosperity I said,
"I shall never be moved."

# Psalms 30:7
Lord, by Your favor You have made my mountain stand strong;
You hid Your face, and I was troubled.

I cried out to You, O Lord;
And to the Lord I made supplication:
{
# Psalms 30:9
  What profit is there in my blood,
  When I go down to the pit?

  Will the dust praise You?

  Will it declare Your truth?

# Psalms 30:10
  Hear, O Lord, and have mercy on me;
  Lord, be my helper!
}

Which You have prepared for those who trust in You
In the presence of the sons of men!

You shall hide them in the secret place of Your presence
From the plots of man;
You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion
From the strife of tongues.

# Psalms 31:21
Blessed be the Lord,
For He has shown me His marvelous kindness in a strong city!

A Psalm of David the servant of the Lord.

# Psalms 36:1
An oracle within my heart concerning
  the transgression of the wicked:
There is no fear of God
  before his eyes.

# Psalms 36:2
For he flatters himself in his own eyes,
When he finds out his iniquity and when he hates.

# Psalms 36:3
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit;
He has ceased to be wise and to do good.

# Psalms 36:4
He devises wickedness on his bed;
He sets himself in a way that is not good;
He does not abhor evil.

# Psalms 36:5
Your mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens;
Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.

# Psalms 36:6
Your righteousness is like the great mountains;
Your judgments are a great deep;
O Lord, You preserve man and beast.

How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God!

Therefore the children of men
  put their trust under the shadow of Your wings.

Do not fret -- it only causes harm.

# Psalms 37:9
For evildoers shall be cut off;
But those who wait on the Lord,
They shall inherit the earth.

# Psalms 37:10
For yet a little while and the wicked shall be no more;
Indeed, you will look carefully for his place,
But it shall be no more.

# Psalms 37:11
But the meek shall inherit the earth,
And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.

# Psalms 37:12
The wicked plots against the just,
And gnashes at him with his teeth.

# Psalms 37:13
The Lord laughs at him,
For He sees that his day is coming.

# Psalms 37:14
The wicked have drawn the sword
And have bent their bow,
To cast down the poor and needy,
To slay those who are of upright conduct.

# Psalms 37:15
Their sword shall enter their own heart,
And their bows shall be broken.

# Psalms 37:16
A little that a righteous man has
Is better than the riches of many wicked.

# Psalms 37:17
For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,
But the Lord upholds the righteous.

# Psalms 37:18
The Lord knows the days of the upright,
And their inheritance shall be forever.

# Psalms 37:19
They shall not be ashamed in the evil time,
And in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.

But the righteous shows mercy and gives.

The righteous shall inherit the land,
And dwell in it forever.

# Psalms 37:30
The mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom,
And his tongue talks of justice.

# Psalms 37:31
The law of his God is in his heart;
None of his steps shall slide.

# Psalms 37:32
The wicked watches the righteous,
And seeks to slay him.

# Psalms 37:33
The Lord will not leave him in his hand,
Nor condemn him when he is judged.

# Psalms 37:34
Wait on the Lord,
And keep His way,
And He shall exalt you to inherit the land;
When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.

# Psalms 37:35
I have seen the wicked in great power,
And spreading himself like a native green tree.

# Psalms 37:36
Yet he passed away, and behold, he was no more;
Indeed I sought him, but he could not be found.

# Psalms 37:37
Mark the blameless man, and observe the upright;
For the future of that man is peace.

Because they trust in Him.

# Psalms 37:41
A Psalm of David.

To bring to remembrance.

# Psalms 38:1
O Lord,
  do not rebuke me in Your wrath,
Nor chasten me
  in Your hot displeasure!

# Psalms 38:2
For Your arrows pierce me deeply,
And Your hand presses me down.

# Psalms 38:3
There is no soundness in my flesh
Because of Your anger,
Nor any health in my bones
Because of my sin.

# Psalms 38:4
For my iniquities have gone over my head;
Like a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.

# Psalms 38:5
My wounds are foul and festering
Because of my foolishness.

# Psalms 38:6
I am troubled,
I am bowed down greatly;
I go mourning all the day long.

# Psalms 38:7
For my loins are full of inflammation,
And there is no soundness in my flesh.

# Psalms 38:8
I am feeble and severely broken;
I groan because of the turmoil of my heart.

# Psalms 38:9
Lord, all my desire is before You;
And my sighing is not hidden from You.

# Psalms 38:10
My heart pants, my strength fails me;
As for the light of my eyes, it also has gone from me.

# Psalms 38:11
My loved ones and my friends stand aloof from my plague,
And my relatives stand afar off.

# Psalms 38:12
Those also who seek my life lay snares for me;
Those who seek my hurt speak of destruction,
And plan deception all the day long.

# Psalms 38:13
But I, like a deaf man, do not hear;
And I am like a mute who does not open his mouth.

# Psalms 38:14
Thus I am like a man who does not hear,
And in whose mouth is no response.

# Psalms 38:15
For in You, O Lord, I hope;
You will hear, O Lord my God.

# Psalms 38:16
For I said,
{
  Hear me, lest they rejoice over me,
  Lest, when my foot slips, they exalt themselves against me.
}

# Psalms 38:17
For I am ready to fall,
And my sorrow is continually before me.

# Psalms 38:18
For I will declare my iniquity;
I will be in anguish over my sin.

# Psalms 38:19
But my enemies are vigorous, and they are strong;
And those who hate me wrongfully have multiplied.

# Psalms 38:20
Those also who render evil for good,
They are my adversaries, because I follow what is good.

# Psalms 38:21
Do not forsake me, O Lord;
O my God, be not far from me!

# Psalms 38:22
Make haste to help me,
O Lord, my salvation!

# Psalms 38:23
To the Chief Musician.

To Jeduthun.

A Psalm of David.

# Psalms 39:1
I said,
{
  I will guard my ways,
  Lest I sin with my tongue;
  I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle,
  While the wicked are before me.
}

# Psalms 39:2
I was mute with silence,
I held my peace even from good;
And my sorrow was stirred up.

# Psalms 39:3
My heart was hot within me;
While I was musing, the fire burned.

Then I spoke with my tongue:
{
# Psalms 39:4
  Lord, make me to know my end,
  And what is the measure of my days,
  That I may know how frail I am.

# Psalms 39:5
  Indeed, You have made my days as handbreadths,
  And my age is as nothing before You;
  Certainly every man at his best state is but vapor.

  Selah

# Psalms 39:6
  Surely every man walks about like a shadow;
  Surely they busy themselves in vain;
  He heaps up riches,
  And does not know who will gather them.

# Psalms 39:7
  And now, Lord, what do I wait for?

  My hope is in You.

# Psalms 39:8
  Deliver me from all my transgressions;
  Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.

# Psalms 39:9
  I was mute, I did not open my mouth,
  Because it was You who did it.

# Psalms 39:10
  Remove Your plague from me;
  I am consumed by the blow of Your hand.

# Psalms 39:11
  When with rebukes You correct man for iniquity,
  You make his beauty melt away like a moth;
  Surely every man is vapor.

  Selah

# Psalms 39:12
  Hear my prayer, O Lord,
  And give ear to my cry;
  Do not be silent at my tears;
  For I am a stranger with You,
  A sojourner, as all my fathers were.

# Psalms 39:13
  Remove Your gaze from me, that I may regain strength,
  Before I go away and am no more.
}

# Psalms 39:14
To the Chief Musician.

A Psalm of David.

# Psalms 40:1
I waited patiently for the Lord;
And He inclined to me,
And heard my cry.

# Psalms 40:2
He also brought me up out of a horrible pit,
Out of the miry clay,
And set my feet upon a rock,
And established my steps.

# Psalms 40:3
He has put a new song in my mouth --
Praise to our God;
Many will see it and fear,
And will trust in the Lord.

# Psalms 40:4
Blessed is that man who makes the Lord his trust,
And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

# Psalms 40:5
Many, O Lord my God, are Your wonderful works
Which You have done;
And Your thoughts toward us
Cannot be recounted to You in order;
If I would declare and speak of them,
They are more than can be numbered.

# Psalms 40:6
Sacrifice and offering You did not desire;
My ears You have opened.

Burnt offering and sin offering You did not require.

# Psalms 40:7
Then I said,
{
  Behold, I come;
  In the scroll of the book it is written of me.

# Psalms 40:8
  I delight to do Your will, O my God,
  And Your law is within my heart.
}

# Psalms 40:9
I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness
In the great assembly;
Indeed, I do not restrain my lips, O Lord,
You Yourself know.

# Psalms 40:10
I have not hidden Your righteousness within my heart;
I have declared Your faithfulness and Your salvation;
I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and Your truth
From the great assembly.

# Psalms 40:11
Do not withhold Your tender mercies from me, O Lord;
Let Your lovingkindness and Your truth continually preserve me.

# Psalms 40:12
For innumerable evils have surrounded me;
My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up;
They are more than the hairs of my head;
Therefore my heart fails me.

# Psalms 40:13
Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me;
O Lord, make haste to help me!

# Psalms 40:14
Let them be ashamed and brought to mutual confusion
Who seek to destroy my life;
Let them be driven backward and brought to dishonor
Who wish me evil.

# Psalms 40:15
Let them be confounded because of their shame,
Who say to me,
{
  Aha, aha!
}

# Psalms 40:16
Let all those who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;
Let such as love Your salvation say continually,

}

# Psalms 41:5
My enemies speak evil of me:
{
  When will he die, and his name perish?
}

# Psalms 41:6
And if he comes to see me, he speaks lies;
His heart gathers iniquity to itself;
When he goes out, he tells it.

# Psalms 41:7
All who hate me whisper together against me;
Against me they devise my hurt.

{
# Psalms 41:8
  An evil disease,
}
they say,
{
  clings to him.

  And now that he lies down,
  he will rise up no more.
}

# Psalms 41:9
Even my own familiar friend in whom I trusted,
Who ate my bread,
Has lifted up his heel against me.

That I may repay them.

My tears have been my food day and night,
While they continually say to me,
{
  Where is your God?
}

# Psalms 41:18

I pour out my soul within me.

For I used to go with the multitude;
I went with them to the house of God,
With the voice of joy and praise,
With a multitude that kept a pilgrim feast.

The help of my countenance and my God.

# Psalms 43:6
To the Chief Musician.

A Contemplation of the sons of Korah.

# Psalms 44:1
We have heard with our ears, O God,
Our fathers have told us,
The deeds You did in their days,
In days of old:

# Psalms 44:2
You drove out the nations with Your hand,
But them You planted;
You afflicted the peoples, and cast them out.

# Psalms 44:3
For they did not gain possession of the land by their own sword,
Nor did their own arm save them;
But it was Your right hand,
Your arm, and the light of Your countenance,
Because You favored them.

# Psalms 44:4
You are my King, O God;
Command victories for Jacob.

# Psalms 44:5
Through You we will push down our enemies;
Through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us.

# Psalms 44:6
For I will not trust in my bow,
Nor shall my sword save me.

# Psalms 44:7
But You have saved us from our enemies,
And have put to shame those who hated us.

# Psalms 44:8
In God we boast all day long,
And praise Your name forever.

Selah

# Psalms 44:9
But You have cast us off and put us to shame,
And You do not go out with our armies.

# Psalms 43:10
You make us turn back from the enemy,
And those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.

# Psalms 43:11
You have given us up like sheep intended for food,
And have scattered us among the nations.

# Psalms 43:12
You sell Your people for next to nothing,
And are not enriched by selling them.

# Psalms 43:13
You make us a reproach to our neighbors,
A scorn and a derision to those all around us.

# Psalms 43:14
You make us a byword among the nations,
A shaking of the head among the peoples.

# Psalms 43:15
My dishonor is continually before me,
And the shame of my face has covered me,
# Psalms 43:16
Because of the voice of him who reproaches and reviles,
Because of the enemy and the avenger.

# Psalms 43:17
All this has come upon us;
But we have not forgotten You,
Nor have we dealt falsely with Your covenant.

# Psalms 43:18
Our heart has not turned back,
Nor have our steps departed from Your way;
# Psalms 43:19
But You have severely broken us in the place of jackals,
And covered us with the shadow of death.

# Psalms 43:20
If we had forgotten the name of our God,
Or stretched out our hands to a foreign god,
# Psalms 43:21
Would not God search this out?

For He knows the secrets of the heart.

# Psalms 43:22
Yet for Your sake we are killed all day long;
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.

# Psalms 43:23
Awake!

Why do You sleep, O Lord?

Arise!

Do not cast us off forever.

# Psalms 43:24
Why do You hide Your face,
And forget our affliction and our oppression?

# Psalms 43:25
For our soul is bowed down to the dust;
Our body clings to the ground.

# Psalms 43:26
Arise for our help,
And redeem us for Your mercies' sake.

You love righteousness and hate wickedness;

All Your garments are scented with myrrh and aloes and cassia,
Out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made You glad.

Kings' daughters are among Your honorable women;
At Your right hand stands the queen in gold from Ophir.

Consider and incline your ear;

So the King will greatly desire your beauty;
Because He is your Lord, worship Him.

# Psalms 44:12
And the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift;
The rich among the people will seek your favor.

And pain, as of a woman in birth pangs,

As when You break the ships of Tarshish
With an east wind.

So we have seen
In the city of the Lord of hosts,

A Psalm of the sons of Korah.

# Psalms 49:1
Hear this, all peoples;
Give ear, all inhabitants of the world,

Both low and high,
Rich and poor together.

# Psalms 49:3
My mouth shall speak wisdom,
And the meditation of my heart shall give understanding.

# Psalms 49:4
I will incline my ear to a proverb;
I will disclose my dark saying on the harp.

# Psalms 49:5
Why should I fear in the days of evil,
When the iniquity at my heels surrounds me?

# Psalms 49:6
Those who trust in their wealth
And boast in the multitude of their riches,

# Psalms 49:7
None of them can by any means redeem his brother,
Nor give to God a ransom for him --

# Psalms 49:8
For the redemption of their souls is costly,
And it shall cease forever --

# Psalms 49:9
That he should continue to live eternally,
And not see the pit.

# Psalms 48:10
For he sees wise men die;
Likewise the fool and the senseless person perish,
And leave their wealth to others.

# Psalms 48:11
Their inner thought is that their houses will last forever,
Their dwelling places to all generations;
They call their lands after their own names.

# Psalms 48:12
Nevertheless man, though in honor, does not remain;
He is like the beasts that perish.

# Psalms 48:13
This is the way of those who are foolish,
And of their posterity who approve their sayings.

Selah

# Psalms 48:14
Like sheep they are laid in the grave;
Death shall feed on them;
The upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
And their beauty shall be consumed in the grave,
  far from their dwelling.

# Psalms 48:15
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave,
For He shall receive me.

Selah

# Psalms 48:16
Do not be afraid when one becomes rich,
When the glory of his house is increased;

For when he dies he shall carry nothing away;
His glory shall not descend after him.

# Psalms 48:18
Though while he lives he blesses himself
(For men will praise you when you do well for yourself),

# Psalms 48:19
He shall go to the generation of his fathers;
They shall never see light.

# Psalms 48:20
A man who is in honor, yet does not understand,
Is like the beasts that perish.

He shall call to the heavens from above,
And to the earth, that He may judge His people:

  I will not rebuke you for your sacrifices
  Or your burnt offerings,
  Which are continually before Me.

# Psalms 50:9
  I will not take a bull from your house,
  Nor goats out of your folds.

  For every beast of the forest is Mine,
  And the cattle on 1000 hills.

  I know all the birds of the mountains,
  And the wild beasts of the field are Mine.

# Psalms 49:12
  If I were hungry, I would not tell you;
  For the world is Mine, and all its fullness.

# Psalms 49:13
  Will I eat the flesh of bulls,
  Or drink the blood of goats?

# Psalms 49:14
  Offer to God thanksgiving,
  And pay your vows to the Most High.

# Psalms 49:15
  Call upon Me in the day of trouble;
  I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me.
}

# Psalms 49:16
But to the wicked God says:
{
  What right have you to declare My statutes,
  Or take My covenant in your mouth,

# Psalms 49:17
  Seeing you hate instruction
  And cast My words behind you?

# Psalms 49:18
  When you saw a thief, you consented with him,
  And have been a partaker with adulterers.

# Psalms 49:19
  You give your mouth to evil,
  And your tongue frames deceit.

# Psalms 49:20
  You sit and speak against your brother;
  You slander your own mother's son.

# Psalms 49:21
  These things you have done, and I kept silent;
  You thought that I was altogether like you;
  But I will rebuke you,
  And set them in order before your eyes.

# Psalms 49:22
  Now consider this, you who forget God,
  Lest I tear you in pieces,
  And there be none to deliver:

# Psalms 49:23
  Whoever offers praise glorifies Me;
  And to him who orders his conduct aright
  I will show the salvation of God.

A Psalm of David

after he had gone in to Bathsheba.

# Psalms 51:1
Have mercy upon me, O God,
According to Your lovingkindness;
According to the multitude
  of Your tender mercies,
Blot out my transgressions.

# Psalms 51:2
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,
And cleanse me from my sin.

# Psalms 51:3
For I acknowledge my transgressions,
And my sin is always before me.

# Psalms 51:4
Against You, You only, have I sinned,
And done this evil in Your sight --
That You may be found
  just when You speak,
And blameless when You judge.

# Psalms 51:5
Behold,
  I was brought forth in iniquity,
And in sin my mother conceived me.

# Psalms 51:6
Behold,
  You desire truth
  in the inward parts,
And in the hidden part
  You will make me to know wisdom.

# Psalms 51:7
Purge me with hyssop,
  and I shall be clean;
Wash me,
  and I shall be whiter than snow.

Make me hear joy and gladness,
That the bones You have broken
  may rejoice.

Create in me a clean heart, O God,
And renew a steadfast spirit within me.

Do not cast me away from Your presence,
And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.

Restore to me the joy of Your salvation,
And uphold me by Your generous Spirit.

Then I will teach transgressors Your ways,
And sinners shall be converted to You.

Deliver me
  from the guilt of bloodshed, O God,
The God of my salvation,
And my tongue shall sing aloud
  of Your righteousness.

# Psalms 50:15
O Lord, open my lips,
And my mouth shall show forth Your praise.

# Psalms 50:16
For You do not desire sacrifice, or else I would give it;
You do not delight in burnt offering.

# Psalms 50:17
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit,
A broken and a contrite heart --
These, O God, You will not despise.

# Psalms 50:18
Do good in Your good pleasure to Zion;
Build the walls of Jerusalem.

# Psalms 50:19
Then You shall be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,
With burnt offering and whole burnt offering;
Then they shall offer bulls on Your altar.

You love all devouring words,
You deceitful tongue.

# Psalms 53:2
God looks down from heaven upon the children of men,
To see if there are any who understand, who seek God.

Every one of them has turned aside;
They have together become corrupt;
There is none who does good,
No, not one.

# Psalms 53:4
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,
Who eat up my people as they eat bread,
And do not call upon God?

There they are in great fear
Where no fear was,

Attend to me, and hear me;

And in wrath they hate me.

My heart is severely pained within me,
And the terrors of death have fallen upon me.

Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me,

Iniquity and trouble are also in the midst of it.

# Psalms 54:11
Destruction is in its midst;
Oppression and deceit do not depart from its streets.

For it is not an enemy who reproaches me;
Then I could bear it.

Nor is it one who hates me who has exalted himself against me;
Then I could hide from him.

But it was you, a man my equal,
My companion and my acquaintance.

# Psalms 54:14
We took sweet counsel together,
And walked to the house of God in the throng.

Let death seize them;
Let them go down alive into hell,
For wickedness is in their dwellings and among them.

Evening and morning and at noon I will pray, and cry aloud,

He has redeemed my soul in peace
  from the battle that was against me,
For there were many against me.

God will hear, and afflict them,
Even He who abides from of old.

He has put forth his hands against those
  who were at peace with him;
He has broken his covenant.

The words of his mouth were smoother than butter,
But war was in his heart;
His words were softer than oil,
Yet they were drawn swords.

Cast your burden on the Lord,
And He shall sustain you;
He shall never permit the righteous to be moved.

Do you indeed speak righteousness,
you silent ones?

Do you judge uprightly,
you sons of men?

# Psalms 58:2
No, in heart you work wickedness;
You weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.

# Psalms 58:3
The wicked are estranged from the womb;
They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.

# Psalms 58:4
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent;
They are like the deaf cobra that stops its ear,

# Psalms 58:5
Which will not heed the voice of charmers,
Charming ever so skillfully.

# Psalms 58:6
Break their teeth in their mouth, O God!

Break out the fangs of the young lions, O Lord!

# Psalms 58:7
Let them flow away as waters which run continually;
When he bends his bow,
Let his arrows be as if cut in pieces.

# Psalms 58:8
Let them be like a snail which melts away as it goes,
Like a stillborn child of a woman, that they may not see the sun.

# Psalms 58:9
Before your pots can feel the burning thorns,
He shall take them away as with a whirlwind,
As in His living and burning wrath.

# Psalms 57:10
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance;
He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked,

# Psalms 57:11
So that men will say,
{
  Surely there is a reward for the righteous;
  Surely He is God who judges in the earth.
}

# Psalms 57:12
To the Chief Musician.

Set to "Do Not Destroy."

A Michtam of David when Saul sent men,
and they watched the house in order to kill him.

# Psalms 59:1
Deliver me from my enemies, O my God;
Defend me from those who rise up against me.

# Psalms 59:2
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
And save me from bloodthirsty men.

# Psalms 59:3
For look, they lie in wait for my life;
The mighty gather against me,
Not for my transgression nor for my sin, O Lord.

# Psalms 59:4
They run and prepare themselves through no fault of mine.

Awake to help me, and behold!

# Psalms 59:5
You therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel,
Awake to punish all the nations;
Do not be merciful to any wicked transgressors.

Selah

# Psalms 59:6
At evening they return,
They growl like a dog,
And go all around the city.

# Psalms 59:7
Indeed, they belch with their mouth;
Swords are in their lips;
For they say,
{
  Who hears?
}

# Psalms 59:8
But You, O Lord, shall laugh at them;
You shall have all the nations in derision.

# Psalms 59:9
I will wait for You, O You his Strength;
For God is my defense;

# Psalms 58:10
My God of mercy shall come to meet me;
God shall let me see my desire on my enemies.

# Psalms 58:11
Do not slay them, lest my people forget;
Scatter them by Your power,
And bring them down, O Lord our shield.

# Psalms 58:12
For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips,
Let them even be taken in their pride,
And for the cursing and lying which they speak.

# Psalms 58:13
Consume them in wrath, consume them,
That they may not be;
And let them know that God rules in Jacob
To the ends of the earth.

Selah

# Psalms 58:14
And at evening they return,
They growl like a dog,
And go all around the city.

# Psalms 58:15
They wander up and down for food,
And howl if they are not satisfied.

# Psalms 58:16
But I will sing of Your power;
Yes, I will sing aloud of Your mercy in the morning;
For You have been my defense
And refuge in the day of my trouble.

# Psalms 58:17
To You, O my Strength, I will sing praises;
For God is my defense, My God of mercy.

# Psalms 58:18
To the Chief Musician.

Set to "Lily of the Testimony."
A Michtam of David.

For teaching.

When he fought against Mesopotamia and Syria of Zobah,
and Joab returned
and killed 12 thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt.

# Psalms 60:1
O God, You have cast us off;
You have broken us down;
You have been displeased;
Oh, restore us again!

# Psalms 60:2
You have made the earth tremble;
You have broken it;
Heal its breaches, for it is shaking.

# Psalms 60:3
You have shown Your people hard things;
You have made us drink the wine of confusion.

# Psalms 60:4
You have given a banner to those who fear You,
That it may be displayed because of the truth.

Selah

# Psalms 60:5
That Your beloved may be delivered,
Save with Your right hand, and hear me.

# Psalms 60:6
God has spoken in His holiness:
{
  I will rejoice;
  I will divide Shechem
  And measure out the Valley of Succoth.

# Psalms 60:7
  Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine;
  Ephraim also is the helmet for My head;
  Judah is My lawgiver.

# Psalms 60:8
  Moab is My washpot;
  Over Edom I will cast My shoe;
  Philistia, shout in triumph because of Me.
}

# Psalms 60:9
Who will bring me to the strong city?

Who will lead me to Edom?

# Psalms 59:10
Is it not You, O God, who cast us off?

And You, O God, who did not go out with our armies?

# Psalms 59:11
Give us help from trouble,
For the help of man is useless.

# Psalms 59:12
Through God we will do valiantly,
For it is He who shall tread down our enemies.

# Psalms 59:13
To the Chief Musician.

On a stringed instrument.

A Psalm of David.

# Psalms 61:1
Hear my cry, O God;
Attend to my prayer.

# Psalms 61:2
From the end of the earth I will cry to You,
When my heart is overwhelmed;
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

# Psalms 61:3
For You have been a shelter for me,
A strong tower from the enemy.

# Psalms 61:4
I will abide in Your tabernacle forever;
I will trust in the shelter of Your wings.

Selah

# Psalms 61:5
For You, O God, have heard my vows;
You have given me the heritage of those who fear Your name.

# Psalms 61:6
You will prolong the king's life,
His years as many generations.

# Psalms 61:7
He shall abide before God forever.

Oh, prepare mercy and truth,
which may preserve him!

# Psalms 61:8
So I will sing praise to Your name forever,
That I may daily perform my vows.

# Psalms 61:9
To the Chief Musician.

To Jeduthun.

A Psalm of David.

# Psalms 62:1
Truly my soul silently waits for God;
From Him comes my salvation.

# Psalms 62:2
He only is my rock and my salvation;
He is my defense;
I shall not be greatly moved.

# Psalms 62:3
How long will you attack a man?

You shall be slain, all of you,
Like a leaning wall and a tottering fence.

# Psalms 62:4
They only consult to cast him down from his high position;
They delight in lies;
They bless with their mouth,
But they curse inwardly.

Selah

# Psalms 62:5
My soul, wait silently for God alone,
For my expectation is from Him.

# Psalms 62:6
He only is my rock and my salvation;
He is my defense;
I shall not be moved.

# Psalms 62:7
In God is my salvation and my glory;
The rock of my strength,
And my refuge, is in God.

# Psalms 62:8
Trust in Him at all times, you people;
Pour out your heart before Him;
God is a refuge for us.

Selah

# Psalms 62:9
Surely men of low degree are a vapor,
Men of high degree are a lie;
If they are weighed on the scales,
They are altogether lighter than vapor.

# Psalms 61:10
Do not trust in oppression,
Nor vainly hope in robbery;
If riches increase,
Do not set your heart on them.

# Psalms 61:11
God has spoken once,
Twice I have heard this:
That power belongs to God.

# Psalms 61:12
Also to You, O Lord, belongs mercy;
For You render to each one according to his work.

# Psalms 61:13
A Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah.

# Psalms 63:1
O God, You are my God;
Early will I seek You;
My soul thirsts for You;
My flesh longs for You
In a dry and thirsty land
Where there is no water.

# Psalms 63:2
So I have looked for You in the sanctuary,
To see Your power and Your glory.

# Psalms 63:3
Because Your lovingkindness is better than life,
My lips shall praise You.

# Psalms 63:4
Thus I will bless You while I live;
I will lift up my hands in Your name.

# Psalms 63:5
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness,
And my mouth shall praise You with joyful lips.

# Psalms 63:6
When I remember You on my bed,
I meditate on You in the night watches.

# Psalms 63:7
Because You have been my help,
Therefore in the shadow of Your wings I will rejoice.

# Psalms 63:8
My soul follows close behind You;
Your right hand upholds me.

# Psalms 63:9
But those who seek my life, to destroy it,
Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.

# Psalms 62:10
They shall fall by the sword;
They shall be a portion for jackals.

# Psalms 62:11
But the king shall rejoice in God;
Everyone who swears by Him shall glory;
But the mouth of those who speak lies shall be stopped.

# Psalms 62:12
To the Chief Musician.

A Psalm of David.

# Psalms 64:1
Hear my voice, O God, in my meditation;
Preserve my life from fear of the enemy.

# Psalms 64:2
Hide me from the secret plots of the wicked,
From the rebellion of the workers of iniquity,

# Psalms 64:3
Who sharpen their tongue like a sword,
And bend their bows to shoot their arrows -- bitter words,

# Psalms 64:4
That they may shoot in secret at the blameless;
Suddenly they shoot at him and do not fear.

# Psalms 64:5
They encourage themselves in an evil matter;
They talk of laying snares secretly;
They say,
{
  Who will see them?
}

# Psalms 64:6
They devise iniquities:
{
  We have perfected a shrewd scheme.
}

Both the inward thought and the heart of man are deep.

# Psalms 64:7
But God shall shoot at them with an arrow;
Suddenly they shall be wounded.

# Psalms 64:8
So He will make them stumble over their own tongue;
All who see them shall flee away.

# Psalms 64:9
All men shall fear,
And shall declare the work of God;
For they shall wisely consider His doing.

# Psalms 63:10
The righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in Him.

And all the upright in heart shall glory.

Blessed is the man You choose,
And cause to approach You,
That he may dwell in Your courts.

We shall be satisfied with the goodness of Your house,
Of Your holy temple.

# Psalms 65:5
By awesome deeds in righteousness You will answer us,
O God of our salvation,
You who are the confidence of all the ends of the earth,
And of the far-off seas;

Who established the mountains by His strength,
Being clothed with power;

# Psalms 65:7
You who still the noise of the seas,
The noise of their waves,
And the tumult of the peoples.

# Psalms 65:8
They also who dwell in the farthest parts are afraid of Your signs;
You make the outgoings of the morning and evening rejoice.

You visit the earth and water it,
You greatly enrich it;
The river of God is full of water;
You provide their grain,
For so You have prepared it.

# Psalms 64:10
You water its ridges abundantly,
You settle its furrows;
You make it soft with showers,
You bless its growth.

# Psalms 64:11
You crown the year with Your goodness,
And Your paths drip with abundance.

# Psalms 64:12
They drop on the pastures of the wilderness,
And the little hills rejoice on every side.

The valleys also are covered with grain;
They shout for joy, they also sing.

He is awesome in His doing toward the sons of men.

He turned the sea into dry land;
They went through the river on foot.

There we will rejoice in Him.

# Psalms 66:7
He rules by His power forever;
His eyes observe the nations;
Do not let the rebellious exalt themselves.

Selah

# Psalms 66:8
Oh, bless our God, you peoples!

And make the voice of His praise to be heard,

# Psalms 66:9
Who keeps our soul among the living,
And does not allow our feet to be moved.

# Psalms 65:10
For You, O God, have tested us;
You have refined us as silver is refined.

# Psalms 65:11
You brought us into the net;
You laid affliction on our backs.

# Psalms 65:12
You have caused men to ride over our heads;
We went through fire and through water;
But You brought us out to rich fulfillment.

# Psalms 65:13
I will go into Your house with burnt offerings;
I will pay You my vows,

# Psalms 65:14
Which my lips have uttered
And my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble.

# Psalms 65:15
I will offer You burnt sacrifices of fat animals,
With the sweet aroma of rams;
I will offer bulls with goats.

Selah

# Psalms 65:16
Come and hear, all you who fear God,
And I will declare what He has done for my soul.

# Psalms 65:17
I cried to Him with my mouth,
And He was extolled with my tongue.

# Psalms 65:18
If I regard iniquity in my heart,
The Lord will not hear.

# Psalms 65:19
But certainly God has heard me;
He has attended to the voice of my prayer.

# Psalms 65:20
Blessed be God,
Who has not turned away my prayer,
Nor His mercy from me!

A father of the fatherless, a defender of widows,
Is God in His holy habitation.

# Psalms 68:6
God sets the solitary in families;
He brings out those who are bound into prosperity;
But the rebellious dwell in a dry land.

# Psalms 68:7
O God, when You went out before Your people,
When You marched through the wilderness,
Selah

# Psalms 68:8
The earth shook;
The heavens also dropped rain at the presence of God;
Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

# Psalms 68:9
You, O God, sent a plentiful rain,
Whereby You confirmed Your inheritance,
When it was weary.

# Psalms 67:10
Your congregation dwelt in it;
You, O God, provided from Your goodness for the poor.

# Psalms 67:11
The Lord gave the word;
Great was the company of those who proclaimed it:
{
# Psalms 67:12
  Kings of armies flee, they flee,
  And she who remains at home divides the spoil.

# Psalms 67:13
  Though you lie down among the sheepfolds,
  You will be like the wings of a dove covered with silver,
  And her feathers with yellow gold.
}

# Psalms 67:14
When the Almighty scattered kings in it,
It was white as snow in Zalmon.

A mountain of God is the mountain of Bashan;
A mountain of many peaks is the mountain of Bashan.

Why do you fume with envy, you mountains of many peaks?

This is the mountain which God desires to dwell in;
Yes, the Lord will dwell in it forever.

The chariots of God are twenty thousand,
Even thousands of thousands;
The Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the Holy Place.

You have led captivity captive;
You have received gifts among men,
Even from the rebellious,
That the Lord God might dwell there.

Blessed be the Lord,
Who daily loads us with benefits,
The God of our salvation!

Selah

# Psalms 67:20
Our God is the God of salvation;
And to God the Lord belong escapes from death.

# Psalms 67:21
But God will wound the head of His enemies,
The hairy scalp of the one who still goes on in His trespasses.

# Psalms 67:22
The Lord said,
{
  I will bring back from Bashan,
  I will bring them back from the depths of the sea,

# Psalms 67:23
  That your foot may crush them in blood,
  And the tongues of your dogs
  may have their portion from your enemies.
}

# Psalms 67:24
They have seen Your procession, O God,
The procession of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.

the players on instruments followed after;
Among them were the maidens playing timbrels.

# Psalms 67:26
Bless God in the congregations,
The Lord, from the fountain of Israel.

# Psalms 67:27
There is little Benjamin, their leader,
The princes of Judah and their company,
The princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali.

# Psalms 67:28
Your God has commanded your strength;
Strengthen, O God, what You have done for us.

# Psalms 67:29
Because of Your temple at Jerusalem,
Kings will bring presents to You.

Rebuke the beasts of the reeds,
The herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples,
Till everyone submits himself with pieces of silver.

Scatter the peoples who delight in war.

Envoys will come out of Egypt;
Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands to God.

# Psalms 67:32
Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth;
Oh, sing praises to the Lord,
Selah

# Psalms 67:33
To Him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which were of old!

Indeed, He sends out His voice, a mighty voice.

# Psalms 67:34
Ascribe strength to God;
His excellence is over Israel,
And His strength is in the clouds.

The God of Israel is He
  who gives strength and power to His people.

Blessed be God!

# Psalms 67:36
To the Chief Musician.

Set the 'The Lilies.'
A Psalm of David.

# Psalms 69:1
Save me, O God!

For the waters have come up to my neck.

# Psalms 69:2
I sink in deep mire,
Where there is no standing;
I have come into deep waters,
Where the floods overflow me.

# Psalms 69:3
I am weary with my crying;
My throat is dry;
My eyes fail while I wait for my God.

# Psalms 69:4
Those who hate me without a cause
Are more than the hairs of my head;
They are mighty who would destroy me,
Being my enemies wrongfully;
Though I have stolen nothing,
I still must restore it.

# Psalms 69:5
O God, You know my foolishness;
And my sins are not hidden from You.

# Psalms 69:6
Let not those who wait for You,
O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed because of me;
Let not those who seek You be confounded because of me,
O God of Israel.

# Psalms 69:7
Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;
Shame has covered my face.

# Psalms 69:8
I have become a stranger to my brothers,
And an alien to my mother's children;

# Psalms 69:9
Because zeal for Your house has eaten me up,
And the reproaches of those who reproach You have fallen on me.

# Psalms 68:10
When I wept and chastened my soul with fasting,
That became my reproach.

# Psalms 68:11
I also made sackcloth my garment;
I became a byword to them.

# Psalms 68:12
Those who sit in the gate speak against me,
And I am the song of the drunkards.

# Psalms 68:13
But as for me, my prayer is to You,
O Lord, in the acceptable time;
O God, in the multitude of Your mercy,
Hear me in the truth of Your salvation.

# Psalms 68:14
Deliver me out of the mire,
And let me not sink;
Let me be delivered from those who hate me,
And out of the deep waters.

# Psalms 68:15
Let not the floodwater overflow me,
Nor let the deep swallow me up;
And let not the pit shut its mouth on me.

# Psalms 68:16
Hear me, O Lord, for Your lovingkindness is good;
Turn to me according to the multitude of Your tender mercies.

# Psalms 68:17
And do not hide Your face from Your servant,
For I am in trouble;
Hear me speedily.

# Psalms 68:18
Draw near to my soul, and redeem it;
Deliver me because of my enemies.

# Psalms 68:19
You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor;
My adversaries are all before You.

# Psalms 68:20
Reproach has broken my heart,
And I am full of heaviness;
I looked for someone to take pity, but there was none;
And for comforters, but I found none.

# Psalms 68:21
They also gave me gall for my food,
And for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

# Psalms 68:22
Let their table become a snare before them,
And their well-being a trap.

# Psalms 68:23
Let their eyes be darkened, so that they do not see;
And make their loins shake continually.

# Psalms 68:24
Pour out Your indignation upon them,
And let Your wrathful anger take hold of them.

# Psalms 68:25
Let their dwelling place be desolate;
Let no one live in their tents.

# Psalms 68:26
For they persecute the ones You have struck,
And talk of the grief of those You have wounded.

# Psalms 68:27
Add iniquity to their iniquity,
And let them not come into Your righteousness.

# Psalms 68:28
Let them be blotted out of the book of the living,
And not be written with the righteous.

# Psalms 68:29
But I am poor and sorrowful;
Let Your salvation, O God, set me up on high.

# Psalms 68:30
I will praise the name of God with a song,
And will magnify Him with thanksgiving.

# Psalms 68:31
This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bull,
Which has horns and hooves.

# Psalms 68:32
The humble shall see this and be glad;
And you who seek God, your hearts shall live.

# Psalms 68:33
For the Lord hears the poor,
And does not despise His prisoners.

# Psalms 68:34
Let heaven and earth praise Him,
The seas and everything that moves in them.

# Psalms 68:35
For God will save Zion
And build the cities of Judah,
That they may dwell there and possess it.

# Psalms 68:36
Also, the descendants of His servants
  shall inherit it,
And those who love His name
  shall dwell in it.

{
  Aha, aha!
}

Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

# Psalms 71:5
For You are my hope, O Lord God;

By You I have been upheld from birth;
You are He who took me out of my mother's womb.

My praise shall be continually of You.

# Psalms 71:7
I have become as a wonder to many,
But You are my strong refuge.

# Psalms 71:8
Let my mouth be filled with Your praise
And with Your glory all the day.

# Psalms 71:9
Do not cast me off in the time of old age;
Do not forsake me when my strength fails.

# Psalms 70:10
For my enemies speak against me;
And those who lie in wait for my life take counsel together,

# Psalms 70:11
Saying,
{
  God has forsaken him;
  Pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver him.
}

# Psalms 70:12

Let them be confounded and consumed
Who are adversaries of my life;
Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor
Who seek my hurt.

# Psalms 70:14
But I will hope continually,
And will praise You yet more and more.

# Psalms 70:15
My mouth shall tell of Your righteousness
And Your salvation all the day,
For I do not know their limits.

# Psalms 70:16
I will go in the strength of the Lord God;
I will make mention of Your righteousness, of Yours only.

# Psalms 70:17
O God, You have taught me from my youth;
And to this day I declare Your wondrous works.

# Psalms 70:18
Now also when I am old and grayheaded,
O God, do not forsake me,
Until I declare Your strength to this generation,
Your power to everyone who is to come.

# Psalms 70:19
Also Your righteousness, O God, is very high,
You who have done great things;
O God, who is like You?

# Psalms 70:20
You, who have shown me great and severe troubles,
Shall revive me again,
And bring me up again from the depths of the earth.

# Psalms 70:21
You shall increase my greatness,
And comfort me on every side.

# Psalms 70:22
Also with the lute I will praise you --
And Your faithfulness, O my God!

To You I will sing with the harp, O Holy One of Israel.

# Psalms 70:23
My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing to You,
And my soul, which You have redeemed.

# Psalms 70:24
My tongue also shall talk of Your righteousness all the day long;
For they are confounded,
For they are brought to shame
Who seek my hurt.

# Psalms 70:25
A Psalm of Solomon.

# Psalms 72:1
Give the king Your judgments, O God,
And Your righteousness to the king's Son.

# Psalms 72:2
He will judge Your people with righteousness,
And Your poor with justice.

# Psalms 72:3
The mountains will bring peace to the people,
And the little hills, by righteousness.

# Psalms 72:4
He will bring justice to the poor of the people;
He will save the children of the needy,
And will break in pieces the oppressor.

# Psalms 72:5
They shall fear You
As long as the sun and moon endure,
Throughout all generations.

# Psalms 72:6
He shall come down like rain upon the grass before mowing,
Like showers that water the earth.

# Psalms 72:7
In His days the righteous shall flourish,
And abundance of peace,
Until the moon is no more.

# Psalms 72:8
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
And from the River to the ends of the earth.

# Psalms 72:9
Those who dwell in the wilderness will bow before Him,
And His enemies will lick the dust.

# Psalms 71:10
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles
Will bring presents;
The kings of Sheba and Seba
Will offer gifts.

# Psalms 71:11
Yes, all kings shall fall down before Him;
All nations shall serve Him.

# Psalms 71:12
For He will deliver the needy when he cries,
The poor also, and him who has no helper.

# Psalms 71:13
He will spare the poor and needy,
And will save the souls of the needy.

# Psalms 71:14
He will redeem their life from oppression and violence;
And precious shall be their blood in His sight.

# Psalms 71:15
And He shall live;
And the gold of Sheba will be given to Him;
Prayer also will be made for Him continually,
And daily He shall be praised.

# Psalms 71:16
There will be an abundance of grain in the earth,
On the top of the mountains;
Its fruit shall wave like Lebanon;
And those of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

His name shall endure forever;
His name shall continue as long as the sun.

And men shall be blessed in Him;
All nations shall call Him blessed.

# Psalms 71:18
Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel,
Who only does wondrous things!

# Psalms 71:19
And blessed be His glorious name forever!

And let the whole earth be filled with His glory.

Amen and Amen.

The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

# Psalms 71:21
A Psalm of Asaph.

# Psalms 73:1
Truly God is good to Israel,
To such as are pure in heart.

# Psalms 73:2
But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled;
My steps had nearly slipped.

# Psalms 73:3
For I was envious of the boastful,
When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

# Psalms 73:4
For there are no pangs in their death,
But their strength is firm.

# Psalms 73:5
They are not in trouble as other men,
Nor are they plagued like other men.

# Psalms 73:6
Therefore pride serves as their necklace;
Violence covers them like a garment.

# Psalms 73:7
Their eyes bulge with abundance;
They have more than heart could wish.

# Psalms 73:8
They scoff and speak wickedly concerning oppression;
They speak loftily.

# Psalms 73:9
They set their mouth against the heavens,
And their tongue walks through the earth.

# Psalms 72:10
Therefore his people return here,
And waters of a full cup are drained by them.

# Psalms 72:11
And they say,
{
  How does God know?

  And is there knowledge in the Most High?
}

# Psalms 72:12
Behold, these are the ungodly,
Who are always at ease;
They increase in riches.

# Psalms 72:13
Surely I have cleansed my heart in vain,
And washed my hands in innocence.

# Psalms 72:14
For all day long I have been plagued,
And chastened every morning.

# Psalms 72:15
If I had said,
{
  I will speak thus,
}

Behold, I would have been untrue to the generation of Your children.

# Psalms 72:16
When I thought how to understand this,
It was too painful for me --

# Psalms 72:17
Until I went into the sanctuary of God;
Then I understood their end.

# Psalms 72:18
Surely You set them in slippery places;
You cast them down to destruction.

# Psalms 72:19
Oh, how they are brought to desolation, as in a moment!

They are utterly consumed with terrors.

# Psalms 72:20
As a dream when one awakes,
So, Lord, when You awake,
You shall despise their image.

# Psalms 72:21
Thus my heart was grieved,
And I was vexed in my mind.

# Psalms 72:22
I was so foolish and ignorant;
I was like a beast before You.

# Psalms 72:23
Nevertheless I am continually with You;
You hold me by my right hand.

# Psalms 72:24
You will guide me with Your counsel,
And afterward receive me to glory.

# Psalms 72:25
Whom have I in heaven but You?

And there is none upon earth that I desire besides You.

# Psalms 72:26
My flesh and my heart fail;
But God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.

# Psalms 72:27
For indeed, those who are far from You shall perish;
You have destroyed all those who desert You for harlotry.

# Psalms 72:28
But it is good for me to draw near to God;
I have put my trust in the Lord God,
That I may declare all Your works.

# Psalms 72:29
A Contemplation of Asaph.

# Psalms 74:1
O God, why have You cast us off forever?

Why does Your anger smoke against the sheep of Your pasture?

# Psalms 74:2
Remember Your congregation, which You have purchased of old,
The tribe of Your inheritance, which You have redeemed --
This Mount Zion where You have dwelt.

# Psalms 74:3
Lift up Your feet to the perpetual desolations.

The enemy has damaged everything in the sanctuary.

# Psalms 74:4
Your enemies roar in the midst of Your meeting place;
They set up their banners for signs.

# Psalms 74:5
They seem like men who lift up
Axes among the thick trees.

# Psalms 74:6
And now they break down its carved work, all at once,
With axes and hammers.

# Psalms 74:7
They have set fire to Your sanctuary;
They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name to the ground.

# Psalms 74:8
They said in their hearts,
{
  Let us destroy them altogether.
}

They have burned up all the meeting places of God in the land.

# Psalms 74:9
We do not see our signs;
There is no longer any prophet;
Nor is there any among us who knows how long.

# Psalms 73:10
O God, how long will the adversary reproach?

Will the enemy blaspheme Your name forever?

# Psalms 73:11
Why do You withdraw Your hand, even Your right hand?

Take it out of Your bosom and destroy them.

# Psalms 73:12
For God is my King from of old,
Working salvation in the midst of the earth.

# Psalms 73:13
You divided the sea by Your strength;
You broke the heads of the sea serpents in the waters.

# Psalms 73:14
You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces,
And gave him as food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

# Psalms 73:15
You broke open the fountain and the flood;
You dried up mighty rivers.

# Psalms 73:16
The day is Yours, the night also is Yours;
You have prepared the light and the sun.

# Psalms 73:17
You have set all the borders of the earth;
You have made summer and winter.

# Psalms 73:18
Remember this, that the enemy has reproached, O Lord,
And that a foolish people has blasphemed Your name.

# Psalms 73:19
Oh, do not deliver the life of Your turtledove to the wild beast!

Do not forget the life of Your poor forever.

# Psalms 73:20
Have respect to the covenant;
For the dark places of the earth are full of the haunts of cruelty.

# Psalms 73:21
Oh, do not let the oppressed return ashamed!

Let the poor and needy praise Your name.

# Psalms 73:22
Arise, O God, plead Your own cause;
Remember how the foolish man reproaches You daily.

# Psalms 73:23
Do not forget the voice of Your enemies;
The tumult of those who rise up against You increases continually.

  The earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved;

# Psalms 75:4
  I said to the boastful,
  {
    Do not deal boastfully,

  And to the wicked,
  {
    Do not lift up the horn.

# Psalms 75:5
    Do not lift up your horn on high;
    Do not speak with a stiff neck.

# Psalms 75:6
For exaltation comes neither from the east
Nor from the west nor from the south.

# Psalms 75:7
But God is the Judge:
He puts down one,
And exalts another.

# Psalms 75:8
For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup,
And the wine is red;
It is fully mixed, and He pours it out;
Surely its dregs shall all the wicked of the earth
Drain and drink down.

# Psalms 75:9
But I will declare forever,
I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

All the horns of the wicked I will also cut off,
But the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.

In Salem also is His tabernacle,
And His dwelling place in Zion.

# Psalms 76:3
There He broke the arrows of the bow,
The shield and sword of battle.

Selah

# Psalms 76:4
You are more glorious and excellent
Than the mountains of prey.

# Psalms 76:5
The stouthearted were plundered;
They have sunk into their sleep;
And none of the mighty men have found the use of their hands.

# Psalms 76:6
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob,
Both the chariot and horse were cast into a dead sleep.

# Psalms 76:7
You, Yourself, are to be feared;
And who may stand in Your presence
When once You are angry?

# Psalms 76:8
You caused judgment to be heard from heaven;
The earth feared and was still,

# Psalms 76:9
When God arose to judgment,
To deliver all the oppressed of the earth.

Selah

# Psalms 75:10
Surely the wrath of man shall praise You;
With the remainder of wrath You shall gird Yourself.

# Psalms 75:11
Make vows to the Lord your God, and pay them;
Let all who are around Him bring presents
  to Him who ought to be feared.

He is awesome to the kings of the earth.

A Psalm of Asaph.

# Psalms 77:1
I cried out to God with my voice --
To God with my voice;
And He gave ear to me.

# Psalms 77:2
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord;
My hand was stretched out in the night without ceasing;
My soul refused to be comforted.

# Psalms 77:3
I remembered God, and was troubled;
I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed.

Selah

# Psalms 77:4
You hold my eyelids open;
I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

# Psalms 77:5
I have considered the days of old,
The years of ancient times.

# Psalms 77:6
I call to remembrance my song in the night;
I meditate within my heart,
And my spirit makes diligent search.

# Psalms 77:7
Will the Lord cast off forever?

And will He be favorable no more?

# Psalms 77:8
Has His mercy ceased forever?

Has His promise failed forevermore?

# Psalms 77:9
Has God forgotten to be gracious?

Has He in anger shut up His tender mercies?

Selah

# Psalms 76:10
And I said,
{
  This is my anguish;
  But I will remember the years
    of the right hand of the Most High.
}

# Psalms 76:11
I will remember the works of the Lord;
Surely I will remember Your wonders of old.

# Psalms 76:12
I will also meditate on all Your work,
And talk of Your deeds.

# Psalms 76:13
Your way, O God, is in the sanctuary;
Who is so great a God as our God?

# Psalms 76:14
You are the God who does wonders;
You have declared Your strength among the peoples.

# Psalms 76:15
You have with Your arm redeemed Your people,
The sons of Jacob and Joseph.

Selah

# Psalms 76:16
The waters saw You, O God;
The waters saw You, they were afraid;
The depths also trembled.

# Psalms 76:17
The clouds poured out water;
The skies sent out a sound;
Your arrows also flashed about.

# Psalms 76:18
The voice of Your thunder was in the whirlwind;
The lightnings lit up the world;
The earth trembled and shook.

# Psalms 76:19
Your way was in the sea,
Your path in the great waters,
And Your footsteps were not known.

# Psalms 76:20
You led Your people like a flock
By the hand of Moses and Aaron.

# Psalms 76:21
A Contemplation of Asaph.

# Psalms 78:1
Give ear, O my people, to my law;
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.

# Psalms 78:2
I will open my mouth in a parable;
I will utter dark sayings of old,

# Psalms 78:3
Which we have heard and known,
And our fathers have told us.

# Psalms 78:4
We will not hide them from their children,
Telling to the generation to come the praises of the Lord,
And His strength and His wonderful works that He has done.

# Psalms 78:5
For He established a testimony in Jacob,
And appointed a law in Israel,
Which He commanded our fathers,
That they should make them known to their children;

# Psalms 78:6
That the generation to come might know them,
The children who would be born,
That they may arise and declare them to their children,

# Psalms 78:7
That they may set their hope in God,
And not forget the works of God,
But keep His commandments;

# Psalms 78:8
And may not be like their fathers,
A stubborn and rebellious generation,
A generation that did not set its heart aright,
And whose spirit was not faithful to God.

# Psalms 78:9
The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,
Turned back in the day of battle.

# Psalms 77:10
They did not keep the covenant of God;
They refused to walk in His law,

# Psalms 77:11
And forgot His works
And His wonders that He had shown them.

# Psalms 77:12
Marvelous things He did in the sight of their fathers,
In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

# Psalms 77:13
He divided the sea and caused them to pass through;
And He made the waters stand up like a heap.

# Psalms 77:14
In the daytime also He led them with the cloud,
And all the night with a light of fire.

# Psalms 77:15
He split the rocks in the wilderness,
And gave them drink in abundance like the depths.

# Psalms 77:16
He also brought streams out of the rock,
And caused waters to run down like rivers.

# Psalms 77:17
But they sinned even more against Him
By rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.

# Psalms 77:18
And they tested God in their heart
By asking for the food of their fancy.

# Psalms 77:19
Yes, they spoke against God:
They said,
{
  Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?

# Psalms 77:20
  Behold, He struck the rock,
  So that the waters gushed out,
  And the streams overflowed.

  Can He give bread also?

  Can He provide meat for His people?
}

# Psalms 77:21
Therefore the Lord heard this and was furious;
So a fire was kindled against Jacob,
And anger also came up against Israel,

# Psalms 77:22
Because they did not believe in God,
And did not trust in His salvation.

# Psalms 77:23
Yet He had commanded the clouds above,
And opened the doors of heaven,

# Psalms 77:24
Had rained down manna on them to eat,
And given them of the bread of heaven.

# Psalms 77:25
Men ate angels' food;
He sent them food to the full.

# Psalms 77:26
He caused an east wind to blow in the heavens;
And by His power He brought in the south wind.

# Psalms 77:27
He also rained meat on them like the dust,
Feathered fowl like the sand of the seas;

# Psalms 77:28
And He let them fall in the midst of their camp,
All around their dwellings.

# Psalms 77:29
So they ate and were well filled,
For He gave them their own desire.

# Psalms 77:30
They were not deprived of their craving;
But while their food was still in their mouths,

# Psalms 77:31
The wrath of God came against them,
And slew the stoutest of them,
And struck down the choice men of Israel.

# Psalms 77:32
In spite of this they still sinned,
And did not believe in His wondrous works.

# Psalms 77:33
Therefore their days He consumed in futility,
And their years in fear.

# Psalms 77:34
When He slew them, then they sought Him;
And they returned and sought earnestly for God.

# Psalms 77:35
Then they remembered that God was their rock,
And the Most High God their Redeemer.

# Psalms 77:36
Nevertheless they flattered Him with their mouth,
And they lied to Him with their tongue;

# Psalms 77:37
For their heart was not steadfast with Him,
Nor were they faithful in His covenant.

# Psalms 77:38
But He, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity,
And did not destroy them.

Yes, many a time He turned His anger away,
And did not stir up all His wrath;

# Psalms 77:39
For He remembered that they were but flesh,
A breath that passes away and does not come again.

# Psalms 77:40
How often they provoked Him in the wilderness,
And grieved Him in the desert!

# Psalms 77:41
Yes, again and again they tempted God,
And limited the Holy One of Israel.

# Psalms 77:42
They did not remember His power:
The day when He redeemed them from the enemy,

# Psalms 77:43
When He worked His signs in Egypt,
And His wonders in the field of Zoan;

# Psalms 77:44
Turned their rivers into blood,
And their streams, that they could not drink.

# Psalms 77:45
He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them,
And frogs, which destroyed them.

# Psalms 77:46
He also gave their crops to the caterpillar,
And their labor to the locust.

# Psalms 77:47
He destroyed their vines with hail,
And their sycamore trees with frost.

# Psalms 77:48
He also gave up their cattle to the hail,
And their flocks to fiery lightning.

# Psalms 77:49
He cast on them the fierceness of His anger,
Wrath, indignation, and trouble,
By sending angels of destruction among them.

# Psalms 77:50
He made a path for His anger;
He did not spare their soul from death,
But gave their life over to the plague,

# Psalms 77:51
And destroyed all the firstborn in Egypt,
The first of their strength in the tents of Ham.

# Psalms 77:52
But He made His own people go forth like sheep,
And guided them in the wilderness like a flock;

# Psalms 77:53
And He led them on safely, so that they did not fear;
But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

# Psalms 77:54
And He brought them to His holy border,
This mountain which His right hand had acquired.

# Psalms 77:55
He also drove out the nations before them,
Allotted them an inheritance by survey,
And made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.

# Psalms 77:56
Yet they tested and provoked the Most High God,
And did not keep His testimonies,

# Psalms 77:57
But turned back and acted unfaithfully like their fathers;
They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

# Psalms 77:58
For they provoked Him to anger with their high places,
And moved Him to jealousy with their carved images.

# Psalms 77:59
When God heard this, He was furious,
And greatly abhorred Israel,

# Psalms 77:60
So that He forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
The tent He had placed among men,
# Psalms 77:61
And delivered His strength into captivity,
And His glory into the enemy's hand.

# Psalms 77:62
He also gave His people over to the sword,
And was furious with His inheritance.

# Psalms 77:63
The fire consumed their young men,
And their maidens were not given in marriage.

# Psalms 77:64
Their priests fell by the sword,
And their widows made no lamentation.

# Psalms 77:65
Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,
Like a mighty man who shouts because of wine.

# Psalms 77:66
And He beat back His enemies;
He put them to a perpetual reproach.

# Psalms 77:67
Moreover He rejected the tent of Joseph,
And did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,

# Psalms 77:68
But chose the tribe of Judah,
Mount Zion which He loved.

# Psalms 77:69
And He built His sanctuary like the heights,
Like the earth which He has established forever.

# Psalms 77:70
He also chose David His servant,
And took him from the sheepfolds;

# Psalms 77:71
From following the ewes that had young He brought him,
To shepherd Jacob His people,
And Israel His inheritance.

# Psalms 77:72
So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart,
And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

# Psalms 77:73
A Psalm of Asaph.

# Psalms 79:1
O God, the nations have come into Your inheritance;
Your holy temple they have defiled;
They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.

# Psalms 79:2
The dead bodies of Your servants
They have given as food for the birds of the heavens,
The flesh of Your saints to the beasts of the earth.

# Psalms 79:3
Their blood they have shed like water all around Jerusalem,
And there was no one to bury them.

# Psalms 79:4
We have become a reproach to our neighbors,
A scorn and derision to those who are around us.

# Psalms 79:5
How long, Lord?

Will You be angry forever?

Will Your jealousy burn like fire?

# Psalms 79:6
Pour out Your wrath on the nations that do not know You,
And on the kingdoms that do not call on Your name.

# Psalms 79:7
For they have devoured Jacob,
And laid waste his dwelling place.

# Psalms 79:8
Oh, do not remember former iniquities against us!

Let Your tender mercies come speedily to meet us,
For we have been brought very low.

# Psalms 79:9
Help us, O God of our salvation,
For the glory of Your name;
And deliver us, and provide atonement for our sins,
For Your name's sake!

# Psalms 78:10
Why should the nations say,
{
  Where is their God?
}

Let there be known among the nations in our sight
The avenging of the blood of Your servants which has been shed.

# Psalms 78:11
Let the groaning of the prisoner come before You;
According to the greatness of Your power
Preserve those who are appointed to die;

# Psalms 78:12
And return to our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom
Their reproach with which they have reproached You, O Lord.

# Psalms 78:13
So we, Your people and sheep of Your pasture,
Will give You thanks forever;
We will show forth Your praise to all generations.

A Psalm.

# Psalms 80:1
Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
You who lead Joseph like a flock;
You who dwell between the cherubim, shine forth!

# Psalms 80:2
Before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh,
Stir up Your strength,
And come and save us!

# Psalms 80:3
Restore us, O God;
Cause Your face to shine,
And we shall be saved!

# Psalms 80:4
O Lord God of hosts,
How long will You be angry
Against the prayer of Your people?

# Psalms 80:5
You have fed them with the bread of tears,
And given them tears to drink in great measure.

# Psalms 80:6
You have made us a strife to our neighbors,
And our enemies laugh among themselves.

# Psalms 80:7
Restore us, O God of hosts;
Cause Your face to shine,
And we shall be saved!

# Psalms 80:8
You have brought a vine out of Egypt;
You have cast out the nations, and planted it.

# Psalms 80:9
You prepared room for it,
And caused it to take deep root,
And it filled the land.

# Psalms 79:10
The hills were covered with its shadow,
And the mighty cedars with its boughs.

# Psalms 79:11
She sent out her boughs to the Sea,
And her branches to the River.

# Psalms 79:12
Why have You broken down her hedges,
So that all who pass by the way pluck her fruit?

# Psalms 79:13
The boar out of the woods uproots it,
And the wild beast of the field devours it.

# Psalms 79:14
Return, we beseech You, O God of hosts;
Look down from heaven and see,
And visit this vine

# Psalms 79:15
And the vineyard which Your right hand has planted,
And the branch that You made strong for Yourself.

# Psalms 79:16
It is burned with fire, it is cut down;
They perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.

# Psalms 79:17
Let Your hand be upon the man of Your right hand,
Upon the son of man whom You made strong for Yourself.

Sing aloud to God our strength;
Make a joyful shout to the God of Jacob.

# Psalms 81:2
Raise a song and strike the timbrel,
The pleasant harp with the lute.

# Psalms 81:3
Blow the trumpet at the time of the New Moon,
At the full moon, on our solemn feast day.

# Psalms 81:4
For this is a statute for Israel,
A law of the God of Jacob.

# Psalms 81:5
This He established in Joseph as a testimony,
When He went throughout the land of Egypt,
Where I heard a language I did not understand.

{
# Psalms 81:6
  I removed his shoulder from the burden;
  His hands were freed from the baskets.

# Psalms 81:7
  You called in trouble, and I delivered you;
  I answered you in the secret place of thunder;
  I tested you at the waters of Meribah.

  Selah

# Psalms 81:8
  Hear, O My people, and I will admonish you!

  O Israel, if you will listen to Me!

# Psalms 81:9
  There shall be no foreign god among you;
  Nor shall you worship any foreign god.

# Psalms 80:10
  I am the Lord your God,
  Who brought you out of the land of Egypt;
  Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.

# Psalms 80:11
  But My people would not heed My voice,
  And Israel would have none of Me.

# Psalms 80:12
  So I gave them over to their own stubborn heart,
  To walk in their own counsels.

# Psalms 80:13
  Oh, that My people would listen to Me,
  That Israel would walk in My ways!

# Psalms 80:14
  I would soon subdue their enemies,
  And turn My hand against their adversaries.

# Psalms 80:15
  The haters of the Lord would pretend submission to Him,
  But their fate would endure forever.

# Psalms 80:16
  He would have fed them also with the finest of wheat;
  And with honey from the rock I would have satisfied you.

Defend the poor and fatherless;
Do justice to the afflicted and needy.

They do not know, nor do they understand;
They walk about in darkness;
All the foundations of the earth are unstable.

# Psalms 82:6
I said,
{
  You are gods,

Do not keep silent, O God!

Do not hold Your peace,
And do not be still, O God!

# Psalms 83:2
For behold, Your enemies make a tumult;
And those who hate You have lifted up their head.

# Psalms 83:3
They have taken crafty counsel against Your people,
And consulted together against Your sheltered ones.

# Psalms 83:4
They have said,
{
  Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation,
  That the name of Israel may be remembered no more.
}

They form a confederacy against You:

The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites;
Moab and the Hagrites;

Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek;
Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;

Make their nobles like Oreb and like Zeeb,
Yes, all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,

Who said,
{
  Let us take for ourselves
  The pastures of God for a possession.
}

# Psalms 82:13
O my God, make them like the whirling dust,
Like the chaff before the wind!

# Psalms 82:14
As the fire burns the woods,
And as the flame sets the mountains on fire,

# Psalms 82:15
So pursue them with Your tempest,
And frighten them with Your storm.

# Psalms 82:16
Fill their faces with shame,
That they may seek Your name, O Lord.

# Psalms 82:17
Let them be confounded and dismayed forever;
Yes, let them be put to shame and perish,

That they may know that You, whose name alone is the Lord,
Are the Most High over all the earth.

# Psalms 88:1
O Lord, God of my salvation,
I have cried out day and night before You.

# Psalms 88:2
Let my prayer come before You;
Incline Your ear to my cry.

# Psalms 88:3
For my soul is full of troubles,
And my life draws near to the grave.

# Psalms 88:4
I am counted with those who go down to the pit;
I am like a man who has no strength,

# Psalms 88:5
Adrift among the dead,
Like the slain who lie in the grave,
Whom You remember no more,
And who are cut off from Your hand.

# Psalms 88:6
You have laid me in the lowest pit,
In darkness, in the depths.

# Psalms 88:7
Your wrath lies heavy upon me,
And You have afflicted me with all Your waves.

Selah

# Psalms 88:8
You have put away my acquaintances far from me;
You have made me an abomination to them;
I am shut up, and I cannot get out;

# Psalms 88:9
My eye wastes away because of affliction.

Lord, I have called daily upon You;
I have stretched out my hands to You.

# Psalms 87:10
Will You work wonders for the dead?

Shall the dead arise and praise You?

Selah

# Psalms 87:11
Shall Your lovingkindness be declared in the grave?

Or Your faithfulness in the place of destruction?

# Psalms 87:12
Shall Your wonders be known in the dark?

And Your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

# Psalms 87:13
But to You I have cried out, O Lord,
And in the morning my prayer comes before You.

# Psalms 87:14
Lord, why do You cast off my soul?

Why do You hide Your face from me?

# Psalms 87:15
I have been afflicted and ready to die from my youth;
I suffer Your terrors;
I am distraught.

# Psalms 87:16
Your fierce wrath has gone over me;
Your terrors have cut me off.

# Psalms 87:17
They came around me all day long like water;
They engulfed me altogether.

# Psalms 87:18
Loved one and friend You have put far from me,
And my acquaintances into darkness.

# Psalms 87:19
A Contemplation of Ethan the Ezrahite.

# Psalms 89:1
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever;
With my mouth will I make known Your faithfulness

{
  Mercy shall be built up forever;
  Your faithfulness You shall establish in the very heavens.
}

{
# Psalms 89:3
  I have made a covenant with My chosen,
  I have sworn to My servant David:
  {
# Psalms 89:4
    Your seed I will establish forever,
    And build up your throne to all generations.
  }
}

Selah

# Psalms 89:5
And the heavens will praise Your wonders, O Lord;
Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the saints.

# Psalms 89:6
For who in the heavens can be compared to the Lord?

Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the Lord?

# Psalms 89:7
God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints,
And to be held in reverence by all those around Him.

# Psalms 89:8
O Lord God of hosts,
Who is mighty like You, O Lord?

Your faithfulness also surrounds You.

# Psalms 89:9
You rule the raging of the sea;
When its waves rise, You still them.

# Psalms 88:10
You have broken Rahab in pieces, as one who is slain;
You have scattered Your enemies with Your mighty arm.

# Psalms 88:11
The heavens are Yours, the earth also is Yours;
The world and all its fullness, You have founded them.

# Psalms 88:12
The north and the south, You have created them;
Tabor and Hermon rejoice in Your name.

# Psalms 88:13
You have a mighty arm;
Strong is Your hand, and high is Your right hand.

# Psalms 88:14
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne;
Mercy and truth go before Your face.

Blessed are the people who know the joyful sound!

They walk, O Lord, in the light of Your countenance.

# Psalms 88:16
In Your name they rejoice all day long,
And in Your righteousness they are exalted.

# Psalms 88:17
For You are the glory of their strength,
And in Your favor our horn is exalted.

# Psalms 88:18
For our shield belongs to the Lord,
And our king to the Holy One of Israel.

# Psalms 88:19
Then You spoke in a vision to Your holy one,
And said:
{
  I have given help to one who is mighty;
  I have exalted one chosen from the people.

# Psalms 88:20
  I have found My servant David;
  With My holy oil I have anointed him,

# Psalms 88:21
  With whom My hand shall be established;
  Also My arm shall strengthen him.

# Psalms 88:22
  The enemy shall not outwit him,
  Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.

# Psalms 88:23
  I will beat down his foes before his face,
  And plague those who hate him.

# Psalms 88:24
  But My faithfulness and My mercy shall be with him,
  And in My name his horn shall be exalted.

# Psalms 88:25
  Also I will set his hand over the sea,
  And his right hand over the rivers.

# Psalms 88:26
  He shall cry to Me,
  {
    You are my Father,
    My God, and the rock of my salvation.
  }

# Psalms 88:27
  Also I will make him My firstborn,
  The highest of the kings of the earth.

# Psalms 88:28
  My mercy I will keep for him forever,
  And My covenant shall stand firm with him.

# Psalms 88:29
  His seed also I will make to endure forever,
  And his throne as the days of heaven.

# Psalms 88:30
  If his sons forsake My law
  And do not walk in My judgments,

# Psalms 88:31
  If they break My statutes
  And do not keep My commandments,

# Psalms 88:32
  Then I will punish their transgression with the rod,
  And their iniquity with stripes.

# Psalms 88:33
  Nevertheless My lovingkindness I will not utterly take from him,
  Nor allow My faithfulness to fail.

# Psalms 88:34
  My covenant I will not break,
  Nor alter the word that has gone out of My lips.

# Psalms 88:35
  Once I have sworn by My holiness;
  I will not lie to David:

# Psalms 88:36
  His seed shall endure forever,
  And his throne as the sun before Me;

# Psalms 88:37
  It shall be established forever like the moon,
  Even like the faithful witness in the sky.
}

Selah

# Psalms 88:38
But You have cast off and abhorred,
You have been furious with Your anointed.

# Psalms 88:39
You have renounced the covenant of Your servant;
You have profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

# Psalms 88:40
You have broken down all his hedges;
You have brought his strongholds to ruin.

# Psalms 88:41
All who pass by the way plunder him;
He is a reproach to his neighbors.

# Psalms 88:42
You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries;
You have made all his enemies rejoice.

# Psalms 88:43
You have also turned back the edge of his sword,
And have not sustained him in the battle.

# Psalms 88:44
You have made his glory cease,
And cast his throne down to the ground.

# Psalms 88:45
The days of his youth You have shortened;
You have covered him with shame.

Selah

# Psalms 88:46
How long, Lord?

Will You hide Yourself forever?

Will Your wrath burn like fire?

# Psalms 88:47
Remember how short my time is;
For what futility have You created all the children of men?

# Psalms 88:48
What man can live and not see death?

Can he deliver his life from the power of the grave?

Selah

# Psalms 88:49
Lord, where are Your former lovingkindnesses,
Which You swore to David in Your truth?

# Psalms 88:50
Remember, Lord, the reproach of Your servants --
How I bear in my bosom the reproach of all the many peoples,

# Psalms 88:51
With which Your enemies have reproached, O Lord,
With which they have reproached the footsteps of Your anointed.

# Psalms 88:52
Blessed be the Lord forevermore!

Amen and Amen.

A Prayer of Moses the man of God.

# Psalms 90:1
Lord, You have been our dwelling place in all generations.

# Psalms 90:2
Before the mountains were brought forth,
Or ever You had formed the earth and the world,
Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.

# Psalms 90:3
You turn man to destruction,
And say,
{
  Return, O children of men.
}

# Psalms 90:4
For 1000 years in Your sight
Are like yesterday when it is past,
And like a watch in the night.

# Psalms 90:5
You carry them away like a flood;
They are like a sleep.

In the morning they are like grass which grows up:

# Psalms 90:6
In the morning it flourishes and grows up;
In the evening it is cut down and withers.

# Psalms 90:7
For we have been consumed by Your anger,
And by Your wrath we are terrified.

# Psalms 90:8
You have set our iniquities before You,
Our secret sins in the light of Your countenance.

# Psalms 90:9
For all our days have passed away in Your wrath;
We finish our years like a sigh.

# Psalms 89:10
The days of our lives are 70 years;
And if by reason of strength they are eighty years,
Yet their boast is only labor and sorrow;
For it is soon cut off, and we fly away.

# Psalms 89:11
Who knows the power of Your anger?

For as the fear of You, so is Your wrath.

# Psalms 89:12
So teach us to number our days,
That we may gain a heart of wisdom.

# Psalms 89:13
Return, O Lord! How long?

And have compassion on Your servants.

# Psalms 89:14
Oh, satisfy us early with Your mercy,
That we may rejoice and be glad all our days!

# Psalms 89:15
Make us glad according to the days in which You have afflicted us,
The years in which we have seen evil.

# Psalms 89:16
Let Your work appear to Your servants,
And Your glory to their children.

# Psalms 89:17
And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us,
And establish the work of our hands for us;
Yes, establish the work of our hands.

# Psalms 91:1
He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

# Psalms 91:2
I will say of the Lord,
{
  He is my refuge and my fortress;
  My God, in Him I will trust.
}

# Psalms 91:3
Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler
And from the perilous pestilence.

# Psalms 91:4
He shall cover you with His feathers,
And under His wings you shall take refuge;
His truth shall be your shield and buckler.

# Psalms 91:5
You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,
Nor of the arrow that flies by day,

# Psalms 91:6
Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,
Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.

# Psalms 91:7
A thousand may fall at your side,
And 10,000 at your right hand;
But it shall not come near you.

# Psalms 91:8
Only with your eyes shall you look,
And see the reward of the wicked.

# Psalms 91:9
Because you have made the Lord, who is my refuge,
Even the Most High, your dwelling place,

# Psalms 90:10
No evil shall befall you,
Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling;

# Psalms 90:11
For He shall give His angels charge over you,
To keep you in all your ways.

# Psalms 90:12
In their hands they shall bear you up,
Lest you dash your foot against a stone.

# Psalms 90:13
You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra,
The young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.

{
# Psalms 90:14
  Because he has set his love upon Me,
    therefore I will deliver him;
  I will set him on high, because he has known My name.

# Psalms 90:15
  He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him;
  I will be with him in trouble;
  I will deliver him and honor him.

# Psalms 90:16
  With long life I will satisfy him,
  And show him My salvation.

On an instrument of ten strings,
On the lute,
And on the harp,
With harmonious sound.

# Psalms 92:4
For You, Lord, have made me glad through Your work;
I will triumph in the works of Your hands.

# Psalms 92:5
O Lord, how great are Your works!

Your thoughts are very deep.

# Psalms 92:6
A senseless man does not know,
Nor does a fool understand this.

# Psalms 92:7
When the wicked spring up like grass,
And when all the workers of iniquity flourish,
It is that they may be destroyed forever.

# Psalms 92:8
But You, Lord, are on high forevermore.

# Psalms 92:9
For behold, Your enemies, O Lord,
For behold, Your enemies shall perish;
All the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

# Psalms 91:10
But my horn You have exalted like a wild ox;
I have been anointed with fresh oil.

# Psalms 91:11
My eye also has seen my desire on my enemies;
My ears hear my desire on the wicked
Who rise up against me.

# Psalms 91:12
The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree,
He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.

# Psalms 91:13
Those who are planted in the house of the Lord
Shall flourish in the courts of our God.

# Psalms 91:14
They shall still bear fruit in old age;
They shall be fresh and flourishing,

# Psalms 91:15
To declare that the Lord is upright;
He is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.

# Psalms 93:1
The Lord reigns, He is clothed with majesty;
The Lord is clothed, He has girded Himself with strength.

Surely the world is established, so that it cannot be moved.

Your throne is established from of old;
You are from everlasting.

# Psalms 93:3
The floods have lifted up, O Lord,
The floods have lifted up their voice;
The floods lift up their waves.

# Psalms 93:4
The Lord on high is mightier
Than the noise of many waters,
Than the mighty waves of the sea.

# Psalms 93:5
Your testimonies are very sure;
Holiness adorns Your house, O Lord, forever.

# Psalms 94:1
O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongs --
O God, to whom vengeance belongs, shine forth!

# Psalms 94:2
Rise up, O Judge of the earth;
Render punishment to the proud.

# Psalms 94:3
Lord, how long will the wicked,
How long will the wicked triumph?

# Psalms 94:4
They utter speech, and speak insolent things;
All the workers of iniquity boast in themselves.

# Psalms 94:5
They break in pieces Your people, O Lord,
And afflict Your heritage.

# Psalms 94:6
They slay the widow and the stranger,
And murder the fatherless.

# Psalms 94:7
Yet they say,
{
  The Lord does not see,
  Nor does the God of Jacob understand.
}

# Psalms 94:8
Understand, you senseless among the people;
And you fools, when will you be wise?

# Psalms 94:9
He who planted the ear, shall He not hear?

He who formed the eye, shall He not see?

# Psalms 93:10
He who instructs the nations, shall He not correct,
He who teaches man knowledge?

# Psalms 93:11
The Lord knows the thoughts of man,
That they are futile.

# Psalms 93:12
Blessed is the man whom You instruct, O Lord,
And teach out of Your law,

# Psalms 93:13
That You may give him rest from the days of adversity,
Until the pit is dug for the wicked.

# Psalms 93:14
For the Lord will not cast off His people,
Nor will He forsake His inheritance.

# Psalms 93:15
But judgment will return to righteousness,
And all the upright in heart will follow it.

# Psalms 93:16
Who will rise up for me against the evildoers?

Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

# Psalms 93:17
Unless the Lord had been my help,
My soul would soon have settled in silence.

# Psalms 93:18
If I say,
{
  My foot slips,
}

Your mercy, O Lord, will hold me up.

# Psalms 93:19
In the multitude of my anxieties within me,
Your comforts delight my soul.

# Psalms 93:20
Shall the throne of iniquity, which devises evil by law,
Have fellowship with You?

# Psalms 93:21
They gather together against the life of the righteous,
And condemn innocent blood.

# Psalms 93:22
But the Lord has been my defense,
And my God the rock of my refuge.

# Psalms 93:23
He has brought on them their own iniquity,
And shall cut them off in their own wickedness;
The Lord our God shall cut them off.

Oh come, let us worship and bow down;
Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.

For He is our God,
And we are the people of His pasture,
And the sheep of His hand.

Today, if you will hear His voice:

{
# Psalms 95:8
  Do not harden your hearts, as in the rebellion,
  As in the day of trial in the wilderness,

# Psalms 95:9
  When your fathers tested Me;
  They tried Me, though they saw My work.

# Psalms 94:10
  For 40 years I was grieved with that generation,
  And said,
  {
    It is a people who go astray in their hearts,
    And they do not know My ways.
  }

# Psalms 94:11
  So I swore in My wrath,
  {
    They shall not enter My rest.

Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it.

The Lord has made known His salvation;

To You, O Lord, I will sing praises.

# Psalms 101:2
I will behave wisely in a perfect way.

Oh, when will You come to me?

I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.

# Psalms 101:3
I will set nothing wicked before my eyes;
I hate the work of those who fall away;
It shall not cling to me.

# Psalms 101:4
A perverse heart shall depart from me;
I will not know wickedness.

# Psalms 101:5
Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor,
Him I will destroy;
The one who has a haughty look and a proud heart,

That they may dwell with me;
He who walks in a perfect way,

# Psalms 101:9
A Prayer of the afflicted,
when he is overwhelmed
and pours out his complaint
before the Lord.

# Psalms 102:1
Hear my prayer, O Lord,
And let my cry come to You.

# Psalms 102:2
Do not hide Your face from me
in the day of my trouble;
Incline Your ear to me;
In the day that I call,
answer me speedily.

# Psalms 102:3
For my days are consumed like smoke,
And my bones are burned like a hearth.

# Psalms 102:4
My heart is stricken and withered like grass,
So that I forget to eat my bread.

# Psalms 102:5
Because of the sound of my groaning
My bones cling to my skin.

# Psalms 102:6
I am like a pelican of the wilderness;
I am like an owl of the desert.

# Psalms 102:7
I lie awake,
And am like a sparrow alone on the housetop.

# Psalms 102:8
My enemies reproach me all day long,
Those who deride me swear an oath against me.

# Psalms 102:9
For I have eaten ashes like bread,
And mingled my drink with weeping,

# Psalms 101:10
Because of Your indignation and Your wrath;
For You have lifted me up and cast me away.

# Psalms 101:11
My days are like a shadow that lengthens,
And I wither away like grass.

# Psalms 101:12
But You, O Lord, shall endure forever,
And the remembrance of Your name to all generations.

# Psalms 101:13
You will arise and have mercy on Zion;
For the time to favor her,
Yes, the set time, has come.

# Psalms 101:14
For Your servants take pleasure in her stones,
And show favor to her dust.

# Psalms 101:15
So the nations shall fear the name of the Lord,
And all the kings of the earth Your glory.

# Psalms 101:16
For the Lord shall build up Zion;
He shall appear in His glory.

# Psalms 101:17
He shall regard the prayer of the destitute,
And shall not despise their prayer.

# Psalms 101:18
This will be written for the generation to come,
That a people yet to be created may praise the Lord.

# Psalms 101:19
For He looked down from the height of His sanctuary;
From heaven the Lord viewed the earth,

# Psalms 101:20
To hear the groaning of the prisoner,
To release those appointed to death,

# Psalms 101:21
To declare the name of the Lord in Zion,
And His praise in Jerusalem,

# Psalms 101:22
When the peoples are gathered together,
And the kingdoms, to serve the Lord.

# Psalms 101:23
He weakened my strength in the way;
He shortened my days.

# Psalms 101:24
I said,
{
  O my God, Do not take me away in the midst of my days;
  Your years are throughout all generations.

# Psalms 101:25
  Of old You laid the foundation of the earth,
  And the heavens are the work of Your hands.

# Psalms 101:26
  They will perish, but You will endure;
  Yes, they will all grow old like a garment;
  Like a cloak You will change them,
  And they will be changed.

# Psalms 101:27
  But You are the same,
  And Your years will have no end.

# Psalms 101:28
  The children of Your servants will continue,
  And their descendants will be established before You.
}

# Psalms 101:29
A Psalm of David.

# Psalms 103:1
Bless the Lord, O my soul;
And all that is within me, bless His holy name!

# Psalms 103:2
Bless the Lord, O my soul,
And forget not all His benefits:

# Psalms 103:3
Who forgives all your iniquities,
Who heals all your diseases,

# Psalms 103:4
Who redeems your life from destruction,
Who crowns you with lovingkindness and tender mercies,

# Psalms 103:5
Who satisfies your mouth with good things,
So that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.

# Psalms 103:6
The Lord executes righteousness
And justice for all who are oppressed.

# Psalms 103:7
He made known His ways to Moses,
His acts to the children of Israel.

# Psalms 103:8
The Lord is merciful and gracious,
Slow to anger, and abounding in mercy.

# Psalms 103:9
He will not always strive with us,
Nor will He keep His anger forever.

# Psalms 102:10
He has not dealt with us according to our sins,
Nor punished us according to our iniquities.

# Psalms 102:11
For as the heavens are high above the earth,
So great is His mercy toward those who fear Him;

# Psalms 102:12
As far as the east is from the west,
So far has He removed our transgressions from us.

# Psalms 102:13
As a father pities his children,
So the Lord pities those who fear Him.

# Psalms 102:14
For He knows our frame;
He remembers that we are dust.

# Psalms 102:15
As for man, his days are like grass;
As a flower of the field, so he flourishes.

# Psalms 102:16
For the wind passes over it, and it is gone,
And its place remembers it no more.

# Psalms 102:17
But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting
On those who fear Him,
And His righteousness to children's children,

# Psalms 102:18
To such as keep His covenant,
And to those who remember His commandments to do them.

# Psalms 102:19
The Lord has established His throne in heaven,
And His kingdom rules over all.

# Psalms 102:20
Bless the Lord, you His angels,
Who excel in strength, who do His word,
Heeding the voice of His word.

# Psalms 102:21
Bless the Lord, all you His hosts,
You ministers of His, who do His pleasure.

# Psalms 102:22
Bless the Lord, all His works,
In all places of His dominion.

Bless the Lord, O my soul!

# Psalms 104:1
Bless the Lord, O my soul!

O Lord my God, You are very great:
You are clothed with honor and majesty,

# Psalms 104:2
Who cover Yourself with light as with a garment,
Who stretch out the heavens like a curtain.

# Psalms 104:3
He lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters,
Who makes the clouds His chariot,
Who walks on the wings of the wind,

# Psalms 104:4
Who makes His angels spirits,
His ministers a flame of fire.

# Psalms 104:5
You who laid the foundations of the earth,
So that it should not be moved forever,

# Psalms 104:6
You covered it with the deep as with a garment;
The waters stood above the mountains.

# Psalms 104:7
At Your rebuke they fled;
At the voice of Your thunder they hastened away.

# Psalms 104:8
They went up over the mountains;
They went down into the valleys,
To the place which You founded for them.

# Psalms 104:9
You have set a boundary that they may not pass over,
That they may not return to cover the earth.

# Psalms 103:10
He sends the springs into the valleys,
They flow among the hills.

# Psalms 103:11
They give drink to every beast of the field;
The wild donkeys quench their thirst.

# Psalms 103:12
By them the birds of the heavens have their home;
They sing among the branches.

# Psalms 103:13
He waters the hills from His upper chambers;
The earth is satisfied with the fruit of Your works.

# Psalms 103:14
He causes the grass to grow for the cattle,
And vegetation for the service of man,
That he may bring forth food from the earth,

# Psalms 103:15
And wine that makes glad the heart of man,
Oil to make his face shine,
And bread which strengthens man's heart.

# Psalms 103:16
The trees of the Lord are full of sap,
The cedars of Lebanon which He planted,

# Psalms 103:17
Where the birds make their nests;
The stork has her home in the fir trees.

# Psalms 103:18
The high hills are for the wild goats;
The cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers.

# Psalms 103:19
He appointed the moon for seasons;
The sun knows its going down.

# Psalms 103:20
You make darkness, and it is night,
In which all the beasts of the forest creep about.

# Psalms 103:21
The young lions roar after their prey,
And seek their food from God.

# Psalms 103:22
When the sun rises, they gather together
And lie down in their dens.

# Psalms 103:23
Man goes out to his work
And to his labor until the evening.

# Psalms 103:24
O Lord, how manifold are Your works!

In wisdom You have made them all.

The earth is full of Your possessions --

# Psalms 103:25
This great and wide sea,
In which are innumerable teeming things,
Living things both small and great.

# Psalms 103:26
There the ships sail about;
There is that Leviathan
Which You have made to play there.

# Psalms 103:27
These all wait for You,
That You may give them their food in due season.

# Psalms 103:28
What You give them they gather in;
You open Your hand, they are filled with good.

# Psalms 103:29
You hide Your face, they are troubled;
You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.

# Psalms 103:30
You send forth Your Spirit, they are created;
And You renew the face of the earth.

# Psalms 103:31
May the glory of the Lord endure forever;
May the Lord rejoice in His works.

# Psalms 103:32
He looks on the earth, and it trembles;
He touches the hills, and they smoke.

# Psalms 103:33
I will sing to the Lord as long as I live;
I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.

# Psalms 103:34
May my meditation be sweet to Him;
I will be glad in the Lord.

# Psalms 103:35
May sinners be consumed from the earth,
And the wicked be no more.

Bless the Lord, O my soul!

Praise the Lord!

# Psalms 105:1
Oh, give thanks to the Lord!

Call upon His name;
Make known His deeds among the peoples!

# Psalms 105:2
Sing to Him, sing psalms to Him;
Talk of all His wondrous works!

# Psalms 105:3
Glory in His holy name;
Let the hearts of those rejoice who seek the Lord!

# Psalms 105:4
Seek the Lord and His strength;
Seek His face evermore!

# Psalms 105:5
Remember His marvelous works which He has done,
His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth,

# Psalms 105:6
O seed of Abraham His servant,
You children of Jacob, His chosen ones!

# Psalms 105:7
He is the Lord our God;
His judgments are in all the earth.

# Psalms 105:8
He remembers His covenant forever,
The word which He commanded, for 1000 generations,

# Psalms 105:9
The covenant which He made with Abraham,
And His oath to Isaac,

# Psalms 104:10
And confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,
To Israel as an everlasting covenant,

# Psalms 104:11
Saying,
{
  To you I will give the land of Canaan
  As the allotment of your inheritance,
}

# Psalms 104:12
When they were few in number,
Indeed very few, and strangers in it.

# Psalms 104:13
When they went from one nation to another,
From one kingdom to another people,

# Psalms 104:14
He permitted no one to do them wrong;
Yes, He rebuked kings for their sakes,

# Psalms 104:15
Saying,
{
  Do not touch My anointed ones,
  And do My prophets no harm.
}

# Psalms 104:16
Moreover He called for a famine in the land;
He destroyed all the provision of bread.

# Psalms 104:17
He sent a man before them --
Joseph -- who was sold as a slave.

# Psalms 104:18
They hurt his feet with fetters,
He was laid in irons.

# Psalms 104:19
Until the time that his word came to pass,
The word of the Lord tested him.

# Psalms 104:20
The king sent and released him,
The ruler of the people let him go free.

# Psalms 104:21
He made him lord of his house,
And ruler of all his possessions,

# Psalms 104:22
To bind his princes at his pleasure,
And teach his elders wisdom.

# Psalms 104:23
Israel also came into Egypt,
And Jacob dwelt in the land of Ham.

# Psalms 104:24
He increased His people greatly,
And made them stronger than their enemies.

# Psalms 104:25
He turned their heart to hate His people,
To deal craftily with His servants.

# Psalms 104:26
He sent Moses His servant,
And Aaron whom He had chosen.

# Psalms 104:27
They performed His signs among them,
And wonders in the land of Ham.

# Psalms 104:28
He sent darkness, and made it dark;
And they did not rebel against His word.

# Psalms 104:29
He turned their waters into blood,
And killed their fish.

# Psalms 104:30
Their land abounded with frogs,
Even in the chambers of their kings.

# Psalms 104:31
He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,
And lice in all their territory.

# Psalms 104:32
He gave them hail for rain,
And flaming fire in their land.

# Psalms 104:33
He struck their vines also, and their fig trees,
And splintered the trees of their territory.

# Psalms 104:34
He spoke, and locusts came,
Young locusts without number,

# Psalms 104:35
And ate up all the vegetation in their land,
And devoured the fruit of their ground.

# Psalms 104:36
He also destroyed all the firstborn in their land,
The first of all their strength.

# Psalms 104:37
He also brought them out with silver and gold,
And there was none feeble among His tribes.

# Psalms 104:38
Egypt was glad when they departed,
For the fear of them had fallen upon them.

# Psalms 104:39
He spread a cloud for a covering,
And fire to give light in the night.

# Psalms 104:40
The people asked, and He brought quail,
And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.

# Psalms 104:41
He opened the rock, and water gushed out;
It ran in the dry places like a river.

# Psalms 104:42
For He remembered His holy promise,
And Abraham His servant.

# Psalms 104:43
He brought out His people with joy,
His chosen ones with gladness.

# Psalms 104:44
He gave them the lands of the Gentiles,
And they inherited the labor of the nations,

# Psalms 104:45
That they might observe His statutes
And keep His laws.

Praise the Lord!

# Psalms 106:1
Praise the Lord!

Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good!

For His mercy endures forever.

# Psalms 106:2
Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?

Who can declare all His praise?

# Psalms 106:3
Blessed are those who keep justice,
And he who does righteousness at all times!

# Psalms 106:4
Remember me, O Lord, with the favor You have toward Your people;
Oh, visit me with Your salvation,

# Psalms 106:5
That I may see the benefit of Your chosen ones,
That I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,
That I may glory with Your inheritance.

# Psalms 106:6
We have sinned with our fathers,
We have committed iniquity,
We have done wickedly.

# Psalms 106:7
Our fathers in Egypt did not understand Your wonders;
They did not remember the multitude of Your mercies,
But rebelled by the sea -- the Red Sea.

# Psalms 106:8
Nevertheless He saved them for His name's sake,
That He might make His mighty power known.

# Psalms 106:9
He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it dried up;
So He led them through the depths,
As through the wilderness.

# Psalms 105:10
He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,
And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

# Psalms 105:11
The waters covered their enemies;
There was not one of them left.

# Psalms 105:12
Then they believed His words;
They sang His praise.

# Psalms 105:13
They soon forgot His works;
They did not wait for His counsel,

# Psalms 105:14
But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness,
And tested God in the desert.

# Psalms 105:15
And He gave them their request,
But sent leanness into their soul.

# Psalms 105:16
When they envied Moses in the camp,
And Aaron the saint of the Lord,

# Psalms 105:17
The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan,
And covered the faction of Abiram.

# Psalms 105:18
A fire was kindled in their company;
The flame burned up the wicked.

# Psalms 105:19
They made a calf in Horeb,
And worshiped the molded image.

# Psalms 105:20
Thus they changed their glory
Into the image of an ox that eats grass.

# Psalms 105:21
They forgot God their Savior,
Who had done great things in Egypt,

# Psalms 105:22
Wondrous works in the land of Ham,
Awesome things by the Red Sea.

# Psalms 105:23
Therefore He said that He would destroy them,
Had not Moses His chosen one stood before Him in the breach,
To turn away His wrath, lest He destroy them.

# Psalms 105:24
Then they despised the pleasant land;
They did not believe His word,

# Psalms 105:25
But complained in their tents,
And did not heed the voice of the Lord.

# Psalms 105:26
Therefore He raised up His hand in an oath against them,
To overthrow them in the wilderness,

# Psalms 105:27
To overthrow their descendants among the nations,
And to scatter them in the lands.

# Psalms 105:28
They joined themselves also to Baal of Peor,
And ate sacrifices made to the dead.

# Psalms 105:29
Thus they provoked Him to anger with their deeds,
And the plague broke out among them.

# Psalms 105:30
Then Phinehas stood up and intervened,
And the plague was stopped.

# Psalms 105:31
And that was accounted to him for righteousness
To all generations forevermore.

# Psalms 105:32
They angered Him also at the waters of strife,
So that it went ill with Moses on account of them;

# Psalms 105:33
Because they rebelled against His Spirit,
So that he spoke rashly with his lips.

# Psalms 105:34
They did not destroy the peoples,
Concerning whom the Lord had commanded them,

# Psalms 105:35
But they mingled with the Gentiles
And learned their works;

# Psalms 105:36
They served their idols,
Which became a snare to them.

# Psalms 105:37
They even sacrificed their sons
And their daughters to demons,

# Psalms 105:38
And shed innocent blood,
The blood of their sons and daughters,
Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;
And the land was polluted with blood.

# Psalms 105:39
Thus they were defiled by their own works,
And played the harlot by their own deeds.

# Psalms 105:40
Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against His people,
So that He abhorred His own inheritance.

# Psalms 105:41
And He gave them into the hand of the Gentiles,
And those who hated them ruled over them.

# Psalms 105:42
Their enemies also oppressed them,
And they were brought into subjection under their hand.

# Psalms 105:43
Many times He delivered them;
But they rebelled in their counsel,
And were brought low for their iniquity.

# Psalms 105:44
Nevertheless He regarded their affliction,
When He heard their cry;

# Psalms 105:45
And for their sake He remembered His covenant,
And relented according to the multitude of His mercies.

# Psalms 105:46
He also made them to be pitied
By all those who carried them away captive.

# Psalms 105:47
Save us, O Lord our God,
And gather us from among the Gentiles,
To give thanks to Your holy name,
To triumph in Your praise.

# Psalms 105:48
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel
From everlasting to everlasting!

And let all the people say,
{
  Amen!
}

Praise the Lord!

# Psalms 107:1
Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good!
For His mercy endures forever.

# Psalms 107:2
Let the redeemed of the Lord say so,
Whom He has redeemed from the hand of the enemy,
# Psalms 107:3
And gathered out of the lands,
From the east and from the west,
From the north and from the south.

# Psalms 107:4
They wandered in the wilderness in a desolate way;
They found no city to dwell in.

# Psalms 107:5
Hungry and thirsty,
Their soul fainted in them.

# Psalms 107:6
Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble,
And He delivered them out of their distresses.

# Psalms 107:7
And He led them forth by the right way,
That they might go to a city for a dwelling place.

# Psalms 107:8
Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men!

# Psalms 107:9
For He satisfies the longing soul,
And fills the hungry soul with goodness.

# Psalms 106:10
Those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
Bound in affliction and irons --
# Psalms 106:11
Because they rebelled against the words of God,
And despised the counsel of the Most High,
# Psalms 106:12
Therefore He brought down their heart with labor;
They fell down, and there was none to help.

# Psalms 106:13
Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble,
And He saved them out of their distresses.

# Psalms 106:14
He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
And broke their chains in pieces.

# Psalms 106:15
Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men!

# Psalms 106:16
For He has broken the gates of bronze,
And cut the bars of iron in two.

# Psalms 106:17
Fools, because of their transgression,
And because of their iniquities, were afflicted.

# Psalms 106:18
Their soul abhorred all manner of food,
And they drew near to the gates of death.

# Psalms 106:19
Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble,
And He saved them out of their distresses.

# Psalms 106:20
He sent His word and healed them,
And delivered them from their destructions.

# Psalms 106:21
Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men!

# Psalms 106:22
Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
And declare His works with rejoicing.

# Psalms 106:23
Those who go down to the sea in ships,
Who do business on great waters,
# Psalms 106:24
They see the works of the Lord,
And His wonders in the deep.

# Psalms 106:25
For He commands and raises the stormy wind,
Which lifts up the waves of the sea.

# Psalms 106:26
They mount up to the heavens,
They go down again to the depths;
Their soul melts because of trouble.

# Psalms 106:27
They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
And are at their wits' end.

# Psalms 106:28
Then they cry out to the Lord in their trouble,
And He brings them out of their distresses.

# Psalms 106:29
He calms the storm,
So that its waves are still.

# Psalms 106:30
Then they are glad because they are quiet;
So He guides them to their desired haven.

# Psalms 106:31
Oh, that men would give thanks to the Lord for His goodness,
And for His wonderful works to the children of men!

# Psalms 106:32
Let them exalt Him also in the assembly of the people,
And praise Him in the company of the elders.

# Psalms 106:33
He turns rivers into a wilderness,
And the watersprings into dry ground;
# Psalms 106:34
A fruitful land into barrenness,
For the wickedness of those who dwell in it.

# Psalms 106:35
He turns a wilderness into pools of water,
And dry land into watersprings.

# Psalms 106:36
There He makes the hungry dwell,
That they may establish a city for a dwelling place,
# Psalms 106:37
And sow fields and plant vineyards,
That they may yield a fruitful harvest.

# Psalms 106:38
He also blesses them, and they multiply greatly;
And He does not let their cattle decrease.

# Psalms 106:39
When they are diminished and brought low
Through oppression, affliction and sorrow,
# Psalms 106:40
He pours contempt on princes,
And causes them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way;

# Psalms 106:41
Yet He sets the poor on high, far from affliction,
And makes their families like a flock.

# Psalms 106:42
The righteous see it and rejoice,
And all iniquity stops its mouth.

# Psalms 106:43
Whoever is wise will observe these things,
And they will understand the lovingkindness of the Lord.

# Psalms 106:44
A Song.

A Psalm of David.

# Psalms 108:1
O God, my heart is steadfast;
I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.

# Psalms 108:2
Awake, lute and harp!

I will awaken the dawn.

# Psalms 108:3
I will praise You, O Lord, among the peoples,
And I will sing praises to You among the nations.

# Psalms 108:4
For Your mercy is great above the heavens,
And Your truth reaches to the clouds.

# Psalms 108:5
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
And Your glory above all the earth;

# Psalms 108:6
That Your beloved may be delivered,
Save with Your right hand, and hear me.

# Psalms 108:7
God has spoken in His holiness:
{
  I will rejoice;
  I will divide Shechem
  And measure out the Valley of Succoth.

# Psalms 108:8
  Gilead is Mine;
  Manasseh is Mine;
  Ephraim also is the helmet for My head;
  Judah is My lawgiver.

# Psalms 108:9
  Moab is My washpot;
  Over Edom I will cast My shoe;
  Over Philistia I will triumph.
}

# Psalms 107:10
Who will bring me into the strong city?

Who will lead me to Edom?

# Psalms 107:11
Is it not You, O God, who cast us off?

And You, O God, who did not go out with our armies?

# Psalms 107:12
Give us help from trouble,
For the help of man is useless.

# Psalms 107:13
Through God we will do valiantly,
For it is He who shall tread down our enemies.

# Psalms 107:14
To the Chief Musician.

A Psalm of David.

# Psalms 109:1
Do not keep silent, O God of my praise!

# Psalms 109:2
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful
Have opened against me;
They have spoken against me with a lying tongue.

# Psalms 109:3
They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,
And fought against me without a cause.

# Psalms 109:4
In return for my love they are my accusers,
But I give myself to prayer.

# Psalms 109:5
Thus they have rewarded me evil for good,
And hatred for my love.

# Psalms 109:6
Set a wicked man over him,
And let an accuser stand at his right hand.

# Psalms 109:7
When he is judged, let him be found guilty,
And let his prayer become sin.

# Psalms 109:8
Let his days be few,
And let another take his office.

# Psalms 109:9
Let his children be fatherless,
And his wife a widow.

# Psalms 108:10
Let his children continually be vagabonds, and beg;
Let them seek their bread also from their desolate places.

# Psalms 108:11
Let the creditor seize all that he has,
And let strangers plunder his labor.

# Psalms 108:12
Let there be none to extend mercy to him,
Nor let there be any to favor his fatherless children.

# Psalms 108:13
Let his posterity be cut off,
And in the generation following let their name be blotted out.

# Psalms 108:14
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord,
And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

# Psalms 108:15
Let them be continually before the Lord,
That He may cut off the memory of them from the earth;

# Psalms 108:16
Because he did not remember to show mercy,
But persecuted the poor and needy man,
That he might even slay the broken in heart.

# Psalms 108:17
As he loved cursing, so let it come to him;
As he did not delight in blessing, so let it be far from him.

# Psalms 108:18
As he clothed himself with cursing as with his garment,
So let it enter his body like water,
And like oil into his bones.

# Psalms 108:19
Let it be to him like the garment which covers him,
And for a belt with which he girds himself continually.

# Psalms 108:20
Let this be the Lord's reward to my accusers,
And to those who speak evil against my person.

# Psalms 108:21
But You, O God the Lord,
Deal with me for Your name's sake;
Because Your mercy is good, deliver me.

# Psalms 108:22
For I am poor and needy,
And my heart is wounded within me.

# Psalms 108:23
I am gone like a shadow when it lengthens;
I am shaken off like a locust.

# Psalms 108:24
My knees are weak through fasting,
And my flesh is feeble from lack of fatness.

# Psalms 108:25
I also have become a reproach to them;
When they look at me, they shake their heads.

# Psalms 108:26
Help me, O Lord my God!

Oh, save me according to Your mercy,

# Psalms 108:27
That they may know that this is Your hand --
That You, Lord, have done it!

# Psalms 108:28
Let them curse, but You bless;
When they arise, let them be ashamed,
But let Your servant rejoice.

# Psalms 108:29
Let my accusers be clothed with shame,
And let them cover themselves
  with their own disgrace as with a mantle.

# Psalms 108:30
I will greatly praise the Lord with my mouth;
Yes, I will praise Him among the multitude.

# Psalms 108:31
For He shall stand at the right hand of the poor,
To save him from those who condemn him.

# Psalms 108:32

Wealth and riches will be in his house,
And his righteousness endures forever.

Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness;
He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

# Psalms 112:5
A good man deals graciously and lends;
He will guide his affairs with discretion.

# Psalms 112:6
Surely he will never be shaken;
The righteous will be in everlasting remembrance.

# Psalms 112:7
He will not be afraid of evil tidings;
His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord.

# Psalms 112:8
His heart is established;
He will not be afraid,
Until he sees his desire upon his enemies.

# Psalms 112:9
He has dispersed abroad,
He has given to the poor;
His righteousness endures forever;
His horn will be exalted with honor.

# Psalms 111:10
The wicked will see it and be grieved;
He will gnash his teeth and melt away;
The desire of the wicked shall perish.

# Psalms 113:1
Praise the Lord!

Praise, O servants of the Lord,
Praise the name of the Lord!

From this time forth and forevermore!

# Psalms 113:3
From the rising of the sun to its going down
The Lord's name is to be praised.

# Psalms 113:4
The Lord is high above all nations,
His glory above the heavens.

# Psalms 113:5
Who is like the Lord our God,
Who dwells on high,

# Psalms 113:6
Who humbles Himself to behold
The things that are in the heavens and in the earth?

# Psalms 113:7
He raises the poor out of the dust,
And lifts the needy out of the ash heap,

# Psalms 113:8
That He may seat him with princes --
With the princes of His people.

# Psalms 113:9
He grants the barren woman a home,
Like a joyful mother of children.

# Psalms 114:1
When Israel went out of Egypt,
The house of Jacob from a people of strange language,

# Psalms 114:2
Judah became His sanctuary,
And Israel His dominion.

The sea saw it and fled;
Jordan turned back.

# Psalms 114:4
The mountains skipped like rams,
The little hills like lambs.

# Psalms 114:5
What ails you, O sea, that you fled?

O Jordan, that you turned back?

# Psalms 114:6
O mountains, that you skipped like rams?

O little hills, like lambs?

# Psalms 114:7
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord,
At the presence of the God of Jacob,

# Psalms 114:8
Who turned the rock into a pool of water,
The flint into a fountain of waters.

# Psalms 115:1
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us,
But to Your name give glory,
Because of Your mercy,
Because of Your truth.

Why should the Gentiles say,
{
  So where is their God?
}

# Psalms 115:3
But our God is in heaven;
He does whatever He pleases.

# Psalms 115:4
Their idols are silver and gold,
The work of men's hands.

They have mouths, but they do not speak;
Eyes they have, but they do not see;

# Psalms 115:6
They have ears, but they do not hear;
Noses they have, but they do not smell;

Nor do they mutter through their throat.

And will call upon the name of the Lord.

  Their sons also shall sit upon your throne forevermore.

  This is My resting place forever;
  Here I will dwell, for I have desired it.

# Psalms 131:15
  I will abundantly bless her provision;
  I will satisfy her poor with bread.

  But upon Himself His crown shall flourish.

Upon the willows in the midst of it.

Saying,
{
  Sing us one of the songs of Zion!
}

How shall we sing the Lord's song
In a foreign land?

Above my chief joy.

The day of Jerusalem,
Who said,
{
  Raze it, raze it,
  To its very foundation!

You understand my thought afar off.

# Psalms 139:3
You comprehend my path and my lying down,
And are acquainted with all my ways.

# Psalms 139:4
For there is not a word on my tongue,
But behold, O Lord, You know it altogether.

# Psalms 139:5
You have hedged me behind and before,
And laid Your hand upon me.

Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
It is high, I cannot attain it.

If I say,
{
  Surely the darkness shall fall on me,

# Psalms 138:19
Oh, that You would slay the wicked, O God!

Depart from me, therefore, you bloodthirsty men.

I hate them with perfect hatred;
I count them my enemies.

They continually gather together for war.

# Psalms 140:3
They sharpen their tongues like a serpent;
The poison of asps is under their lips.

Selah

# Psalms 140:4
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked;
Preserve me from violent men,
Who have purposed to make my steps stumble.

# Psalms 140:5
The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords;
They have spread a net by the wayside;
They have set traps for me.

I said to the Lord:
{
  You are my God;
  Hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord.

# Psalms 140:7
  O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation,
  You have covered my head in the day of battle.

# Psalms 140:8
  Do not grant, O Lord, the desires of the wicked;
  Do not further his wicked scheme,
  Lest they be exalted.

  Selah

# Psalms 140:9
  As for the head of those who surround me,
  Let the evil of their lips cover them;

# Psalms 139:10
  Let burning coals fall upon them;
  Let them be cast into the fire,
  Into deep pits,
  that they rise not up again.

  Let not a slanderer be established in the earth;
  Let evil hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

# Psalms 141:1
Lord, I cry out to You;

Give ear to my voice when I cry out to You.

# Psalms 141:2
Let my prayer be set before You as incense,
The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

# Psalms 141:3
Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth;
Keep watch over the door of my lips.

# Psalms 141:4
Do not incline my heart to any evil thing,
To practice wicked works
With men who work iniquity;
And do not let me eat of their delicacies.

# Psalms 141:5
Let the righteous strike me;
It shall be a kindness.

And let him rebuke me;
It shall be as excellent oil;
Let my head not refuse it.

For still my prayer is against the deeds of the wicked.

# Psalms 141:6
Their judges are overthrown by the sides of the cliff,
And they hear my words, for they are sweet.

I pour out my complaint before Him;
I declare before Him my trouble.

# Psalms 142:3
When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,
Then You knew my path.

In the way in which I walk
They have secretly set a snare for me.

# Psalms 142:4
Look on my right hand and see,
For there is no one who acknowledges me;
Refuge has failed me;
No one cares for my soul.

# Psalms 142:5
I cried out to You, O Lord:
I said,
{
  You are my refuge,
  My portion in the land of the living.

# Psalms 142:6
  Attend to my cry,
  For I am brought very low;
  Deliver me from my persecutors,
  For they are stronger than I.

# Psalms 142:7

  That I may praise Your name;
  The righteous shall surround me,
  For You shall deal bountifully with me.

In Your faithfulness answer me,
And in Your righteousness.

Do not enter into judgment with Your servant,
For in Your sight no one living is righteous.

Like those who have long been dead.

# Psalms 143:4
Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me;
My heart within me is distressed.

# Psalms 143:5
I remember the days of old;
I meditate on all Your works;
I muse on the work of Your hands.

I spread out my hands to You;
My soul longs for You like a thirsty land.

Answer me speedily, O Lord;
My spirit fails!

Do not hide Your face from me,
Lest I be like those who go down into the pit.

Sculptured in palace style;
