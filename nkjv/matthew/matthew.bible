# Bible:   Matthew
# Version: NKJV

# Matthew 1:1
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ,
the Son of David,
the Son of Abraham:

  # Matthew 1:2
  Abraham begot Isaac,
  Isaac begot Jacob,
  and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.

  # Matthew 1:3
  Judah begot Perez and Zerah by Tamar,
  Perez begot Hezron,
  and Hezron begot Ram.

  # Matthew 1:4
  Ram begot Amminadab,
  Amminadab begot Nahshon,
  and Nahshon begot Salmon.

  # Matthew 1:5
  Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab,
  Boaz begot Obed by Ruth,
  Obed begot Jesse,
  # Matthew 1:6
  and Jesse begot David the king.

  David the king begot Solomon
  by her who had been the wife of Uriah.

  # Matthew 1:7
  Solomon begot Rehoboam,
  Rehoboam begot Abijah,
  and Abijah begot Asa.

  # Matthew 1:8
  Asa begot Jehoshaphat,
  Jehoshaphat begot Joram,
  and Joram begot Uzziah.

  # Matthew 1:9
  Uzziah begot Jotham,
  Jotham begot Ahaz,
  and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.

  # Matthew 1:10
  Hezekiah begot Manasseh,
  Manasseh begot Amon,
  and Amon begot Josiah.

  # Matthew 1:11
  Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers
  about the time they were carried away to Babylon.

  # Matthew 1:12
  And after they were brought to Babylon,
  Jeconiah begot Shealtiel,
  and Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel.

  # Matthew 1:13
  Zerubbabel begot Abiud,
  Abiud begot Eliakim,
  and Eliakim begot Azor.

  # Matthew 1:14
  Azor begot Zadok,
  Zadok begot Achim,
  and Achim begot Eliud.

  # Matthew 1:15
  Eliud begot Eleazar,
  Eleazar begot Matthan,
  and Matthan begot Jacob.

  # Matthew 1:16
  And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary,
  of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.

# Matthew 1:17
So all the generations from Abraham to David
  are fourteen generations,
from David until the captivity in Babylon
  are fourteen generations,
and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ
  are fourteen generations.

# Matthew 1:18
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows:

After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph,
before they came together,
she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.

# Matthew 1:19
Then Joseph her husband,
being a just man,
and not wanting to make her a public example,
was minded to put her away secretly.

# Matthew 1:20
But while he thought about these things,
behold,
an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream,
saying,
{
  Joseph, son of David,
  do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife,
  for that which is conceived in her
  is of the Holy Spirit.

  # Matthew 1:21
  And she will bring forth a Son,
  and you shall call His name Jesus,
  for He will save His people from their sins.
}

# Matthew 1:22
So all this was done that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet,
saying:
{
  # Matthew 1:23
  Behold,
  the virgin shall be with child,
  and bear a Son,
  and they shall call His name Immanuel,
}
which is translated,
{
  God with us.
}

# Matthew 1:24
Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep,
did as the angel of the Lord commanded him
and took to him his wife,
# Matthew 1:25
and did not know her
till she had brought forth her firstborn Son.

And he called His name Jesus.

# Matthew 2:1
Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea
in the days of Herod the king,
behold,
wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,
# Matthew 2:2
saying,
{
  Where is He who has been born King of the Jews?

  For we have seen His star in the East
  and have come to worship Him.
}

# Matthew 2:3
When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled,
and all Jerusalem with him.

# Matthew 2:4
And when he had gathered all the chief priests
and scribes of the people together,
he inquired of them
where the Christ was to be born.

# Matthew 2:5
So they said to him,
{
  In Bethlehem of Judea,
  for thus it is written by the prophet:
  {
    # Matthew 2:6
    But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
    Are not the least among the rulers of Judah;
    For out of you shall come a Ruler
    Who will shepherd My people Israel.
  }
}

# Matthew 2:7
Then Herod,
when he had secretly called the wise men,
determined from them what time the star appeared.

# Matthew 2:8
And he sent them to Bethlehem and said,
{
  Go and search carefully for the young Child,
  and when you have found Him,
  bring back word to me,
  that I may come and worship Him also.
}

# Matthew 2:9
When they heard the king, they departed;
and behold,
the star which they had seen in the East
went before them,
till it came and stood over
where the young Child was.

# Matthew 2:10
When they saw the star,
they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.

# Matthew 2:11
And when they had come into the house,
they saw the young Child with Mary His mother,
and fell down and worshiped Him.

And when they had opened their treasures,
they presented gifts to Him:
gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

# Matthew 2:12
Then, being divinely warned in a dream
that they should not return to Herod,
they departed for their own country another way.

# Matthew 2:13
Now when they had departed,
behold,
an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream,
saying,
{
  Arise,
  take the young Child and His mother,
  flee to Egypt,
  and stay there until I bring you word;
  for Herod will seek the young Child
  to destroy Him.
}

# Matthew 2:14
When he arose,
he took the young Child and His mother by night
and departed for Egypt,
# Matthew 2:15
and was there until the death of Herod,
that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the Lord
through the prophet,
saying,
{
  Out of Egypt I called My Son.
}

# Matthew 2:16
Then Herod,
when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men,
was exceedingly angry;
and he sent forth and put to death
all the male children
who were in Bethlehem
and in all its districts,
from two years old and under,
according to the time
which he had determined from the wise men.

# Matthew 2:17
Then was fulfilled
what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet,
saying:
{
  # Matthew 2:18
  A voice was heard in Ramah,
  Lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,
  Rachel weeping for her children,
  Refusing to be comforted,
  Because they are no more.
}

# Matthew 2:19
But when Herod was dead,
behold,
an angel of the Lord
appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
# Matthew 2:20
saying,
{
  Arise,
  take the young Child and His mother,
  and go to the land of Israel,
  for those who sought the young Child's life
  are dead.
}

# Matthew 2:21
Then he arose,
took the young Child and His mother,
and came into the land of Israel.

# Matthew 2:22
But when he heard that Archelaus
was reigning over Judea
instead of his father Herod,
he was afraid to go there.

And being warned by God in a dream,
he turned aside into the region of Galilee.

# Matthew 2:23
And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth,
that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the prophets,
{
  He shall be called a Nazarene.
}

# Matthew 3:1
In those days John the Baptist came preaching
in the wilderness of Judea,
# Matthew 3:2
and saying,
{
  Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!
}

# Matthew 3:3
For this is he who was spoken of
by the prophet Isaiah,
saying:
{
  The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
  {
    Prepare the way of the Lord;
    Make His paths straight.
  }
}

# Matthew 3:4
And John himself was clothed in camel's hair,
with a leather belt around his waist;
and his food was locusts and wild honey.

# Matthew 3:5
Then Jerusalem, all Judea,
and all the region around the Jordan
went out to him
# Matthew 3:6
and were baptized by him in the Jordan,
confessing their sins.

# Matthew 3:7
But when he saw
many of the Pharisees and Sadducees
coming to his baptism,
he said to them,
{
  Brood of vipers!

  Who warned you to flee
  from the wrath to come?

  # Matthew 3:8
  Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance,
  # Matthew 3:9
  and do not think to say to yourselves,
  {
    We have Abraham as our father.
  }

  For I say to you that God is able
  to raise up children to Abraham
  from these stones.

  # Matthew 3:10
  And even now
  the ax is laid to the root of the trees.

  Therefore every tree
  which does not bear good fruit is cut down
  and thrown into the fire.

  # Matthew 3:11
  I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance,
  but He who is coming after me is mightier than I,
  whose sandals I am not worthy to carry.

  He will baptize you
  with the Holy Spirit and fire.

  # Matthew 3:12
  His winnowing fan is in His hand,
  and He will thoroughly clean out
  His threshing floor,
  and gather His wheat into the barn;
  but He will burn up the chaff
  with unquenchable fire.
}

# Matthew 3:13
Then Jesus came from Galilee
to John at the Jordan
to be baptized by him.

# Matthew 3:14
And John tried to prevent Him,
saying,
{
  I need to be baptized by You,
  and are You coming to me?
}

# Matthew 3:15
But Jesus answered and said to him,
{
  Permit it to be so now,
  for thus it is fitting for us
  to fulfill all righteousness.
}

Then he allowed Him.

# Matthew 3:16
When He had been baptized,
Jesus came up immediately from the water;
and behold, the heavens were opened to Him,
and He saw the Spirit of God
descending like a dove and alighting upon Him.

# Matthew 3:17
And suddenly a voice came from heaven,
saying,
{
  This is My beloved Son,
  in whom I am well pleased.
}

# Matthew 4:1
Then Jesus was led up
by the Spirit
into the wilderness
to be tempted
by the devil.

# Matthew 4:2
And when He had fasted forty days and forty nights,
afterward He was hungry.

# Matthew 4:3
Now when the tempter came to Him,
he said,
{
  If You are the Son of God,
  command that these stones become bread.
}

# Matthew 4:4
But He answered and said,
{
  It is written,
  {
    Man shall not live by bread alone,
    but by every word that proceeds
    from the mouth of God.
  }
}

# Matthew 4:5
Then the devil took Him up into the holy city,
set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,
# Matthew 4:6
and said to Him,
{
  If You are the Son of God,
  throw Yourself down.

  For it is written:
  {
    He shall give His angels charge over you,
  }
  and,
  {
    In their hands they shall bear you up,
    Lest you dash your foot against a stone.
  }
}

# Matthew 4:7
Jesus said to him,
{
  It is written again,
  {
    You shall not tempt the Lord your God.
  }
}

# Matthew 4:8
Again,
the devil took Him up
on an exceedingly high mountain,
and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world
and their glory.

# Matthew 4:9
And he said to Him,
{
  All these things I will give You
  if You will fall down and worship me.
}

# Matthew 4:10
Then Jesus said to him,
{
  Away with you, Satan!

  For it is written,
  {
    You shall worship the Lord your God,
    and Him only you shall serve.
  }
}

# Matthew 4:11
Then the devil left Him,
and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.

# Matthew 4:12
Now when Jesus heard
that John had been put in prison,
He departed to Galilee.

# Matthew 4:13
And leaving Nazareth,
He came and dwelt in Capernaum,
which is by the sea,
in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
# Matthew 4:14
that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet,
saying:
{
  # Matthew 4:15
  The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
  By the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,
  Galilee of the Gentiles:
  # Matthew 4:16
  The people who sat in darkness
    have seen a great light,
  And upon those who sat
    in the region and shadow of death
  Light has dawned.
}

# Matthew 4:17
From that time Jesus began to preach and to say,
{
  Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
}

# Matthew 4:18
And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee,
saw two brothers,
Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother,
casting a net into the sea;
for they were fishermen.

# Matthew 4:19
Then He said to them,
{
  Follow Me,
  and I will make you fishers of men.
}

# Matthew 4:20
They immediately left their nets and followed Him.

# Matthew 4:21
Going on from there, He saw two other brothers,
James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
in the boat with Zebedee their father,
mending their nets.

He called them,
# Matthew 4:22
and immediately they left the boat and their father,
and followed Him.

# Matthew 4:23
And Jesus went about all Galilee,
teaching in their synagogues,
preaching the gospel of the kingdom,
and healing all kinds of sickness
and all kinds of disease
among the people.

# Matthew 4:24
Then His fame went throughout all Syria;
and they brought to Him all sick people
who were afflicted with various diseases and torments,
and those who were demon-possessed,
epileptics, and paralytics;
and He healed them.

# Matthew 4:25
Great multitudes followed Him -- from Galilee,
and from Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea,
and beyond the Jordan.

# Matthew 4:26
And seeing the multitudes,
He went up on a mountain,
and when He was seated His disciples came to Him.

# Matthew 4:27
Then He opened His mouth and taught them,
saying:
{
  # Matthew 4:28
  Blessed are the poor in spirit,
  For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

  # Matthew 4:29
  Blessed are those who mourn,
  For they shall be comforted.

  # Matthew 4:30
  Blessed are the meek,
  For they shall inherit the earth.

  # Matthew 4:31
  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst
    for righteousness,
  For they shall be filled.

  # Matthew 4:32
  Blessed are the merciful,
  For they shall obtain mercy.

  # Matthew 4:33
  Blessed are the pure in heart,
  For they shall see God.

  # Matthew 4:34
  Blessed are the peacemakers,
  For they shall be called sons of God.

  # Matthew 4:35
  Blessed are those who are persecuted
    for righteousness' sake,
  For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

  # Matthew 4:36
  Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you,
  and say all kinds of evil against you falsely
  for My sake.

  # Matthew 4:37
  Rejoice and be exceedingly glad,
  for great is your reward in heaven,
  for so they persecuted the prophets
  who were before you.

  # Matthew 4:38
  You are the salt of the earth;
  but if the salt loses its flavor,
  how shall it be seasoned?

  It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out
  and trampled underfoot by men.

  # Matthew 4:39
  You are the light of the world.

  A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.

  # Matthew 4:40
  Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket,
  but on a lampstand,
  and it gives light to all who are in the house.

  # Matthew 4:41
  Let your light so shine before men,
  that they may see your good works
  and glorify your Father in heaven.

  # Matthew 4:42
  Do not think that I came to destroy
  the Law or the Prophets.

  I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.

  # Matthew 4:43
  For assuredly, I say to you,
  till heaven and earth pass away,
  one jot or one tittle will by no means pass
  from the law
  till all is fulfilled.

  # Matthew 4:44
  Whoever therefore breaks one of the least
  of these commandments,
  and teaches men so,
  shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;
  but whoever does and teaches them,
  he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.

  # Matthew 4:45
  For I say to you,
  that unless your righteousness
  exceeds the righteousness
  of the scribes and Pharisees,
  you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.

  # Matthew 4:46
  You have heard that it was said to those of old,
  {
    You shall not murder,
    and whoever murders
    will be in danger of the judgment.
  }

  # Matthew 4:47
  But I say to you that whoever is angry
  with his brother without a cause
  shall be in danger of the judgment.

  And whoever says to his brother, "Raca!"
  shall be in danger of the council.

  But whoever says, "You fool!"
  shall be in danger of hell fire.

  # Matthew 4:48
  Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar,
  and there remember
  that your brother has something against you,
  # Matthew 4:49
  leave your gift there before the altar,
  and go your way.

  First be reconciled to your brother,
  and then come and offer your gift.

  # Matthew 4:50
  Agree with your adversary quickly,
  while you are on the way with him,
  lest your adversary deliver you to the judge,
  the judge hand you over to the officer,
  and you be thrown into prison.

  # Matthew 4:51
  Assuredly, I say to you,
  you will by no means get out of there
  till you have paid the last penny.

  # Matthew 4:52
  You have heard that it was said
  to those of old,
  {
    You shall not commit adultery.
  }

  # Matthew 4:53
  But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman
  to lust for her
  has already committed adultery with her
  in his heart.

  # Matthew 4:54
  If your right eye causes you to sin,
  pluck it out and cast it from you;
  for it is more profitable for you
  that one of your members perish,
  than for your whole body to be cast into hell.

  # Matthew 4:55
  And if your right hand causes you to sin,
  cut it off and cast it from you;
  for it is more profitable for you
  that one of your members perish,
  than for your whole body to be cast into hell.

  # Matthew 4:56
  Furthermore it has been said,
  {
    Whoever divorces his wife,
    let him give her a certificate of divorce.
  }

  # Matthew 4:57
  But I say to you
  that whoever divorces his wife for any reason
  except sexual immorality
  causes her to commit adultery;
  and whoever marries a woman
  who is divorced commits adultery.

  # Matthew 4:58
  Again you have heard that it was said
  to those of old,
  {
    You shall not swear falsely,
    but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.
  }

  # Matthew 4:59
  But I say to you, do not swear at all:
  neither by heaven,
    for it is God's throne;
  # Matthew 4:60
  nor by the earth,
    for it is His footstool;
  nor by Jerusalem,
    for it is the city of the great King.

  # Matthew 4:61
  Nor shall you swear by your head,
  because you cannot
  make one hair white or black.

  # Matthew 4:62
  But let your "Yes" be "Yes,"
  and your "No," "No."

  For whatever is more than these
  is from the evil one.

  # Matthew 4:63
  You have heard that it was said,
  {
    An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
  }

  # Matthew 4:64
  But I tell you not to resist an evil person.

  But whoever slaps you on your right cheek,
  turn the other to him also.

  # Matthew 4:65
  If anyone wants to sue you
  and take away your tunic,
  let him have your cloak also.

  # Matthew 4:66
  And whoever compels you to go one mile,
  go with him two.

  # Matthew 4:67
  Give to him who asks you,
  and from him who wants to borrow from you
  do not turn away.

  # Matthew 4:68
  You have heard that it was said,
  {
    You shall love your neighbor
    and hate your enemy.
  }

  # Matthew 4:69
  But I say to you, love your enemies,
  bless those who curse you,
  do good to those who hate you,
  and pray for those
  who spitefully use you and persecute you,
  # Matthew 4:70
  that you may be sons of your Father in heaven;
  for He makes His sun rise
  on the evil and on the good,
  and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.

  # Matthew 4:71
  For if you love those who love you,
  what reward have you?

  # Matthew 4:72
  Do not even the tax collectors do the same?

  # Matthew 4:73
  And if you greet your brethren only,
  what do you do more than others?

  Do not even the tax collectors do so?

  # Matthew 4:74
  Therefore you shall be perfect,
  just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

  # Matthew 5:1
  Take heed that you do not do
  your charitable deeds before men,
  to be seen by them.

  Otherwise you have no reward
  from your Father in heaven.

  # Matthew 5:2
  Therefore, when you do a charitable deed,
  do not sound a trumpet before you
  as the hypocrites do
  in the synagogues and in the streets,
  that they may have glory from men.

  Assuredly, I say to you,
  they have their reward.

  # Matthew 5:3
  But when you do a charitable deed,
  do not let your left hand know
  what your right hand is doing,
  # Matthew 5:4
  that your charitable deed may be in secret;
  and your Father who sees in secret
  will Himself reward you openly.

  # Matthew 5:5
  And when you pray,
  you shall not be like the hypocrites.

  For they love to pray
  standing in the synagogues
  and on the corners of the streets,
  that they may be seen by men.

  Assuredly, I say to you,
  they have their reward.

  # Matthew 5:6
  But you, when you pray, go into your room,
  and when you have shut your door,
  pray to your Father who is in the secret place;
  and your Father who sees in secret
  will reward you openly.

  # Matthew 5:7
  And when you pray,
  do not use vain repetitions
  as the heathen do.

  For they think that they will be heard
  for their many words.

  # Matthew 5:8
  Therefore do not be like them.

  For your Father knows
  the things you have need of
  before you ask Him.

  # Matthew 5:9
  In this manner, therefore, pray:

  Our Father [who is] in heaven,
  Hallowed be Your name.

  # Matthew 5:10
  Your kingdom come.

  Your will be done
  On earth as it is in heaven.

  # Matthew 5:11
  Give us this day our daily bread.

  # Matthew 5:12
  And forgive us our debts,
  As we forgive our debtors.

  # Matthew 5:13
  And lead us not into temptation
  But deliver us from evil.

  # Matthew 5:14
  And do not lead us into temptation,
  But deliver us from the evil one.

  For Yours is the kingdom
  and the power
  and the glory forever.

  Amen.

  # Matthew 5:15
  For if you forgive men their trespasses,
  your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

  # Matthew 5:16
  But if you
    do not forgive men their trespasses,
  neither will your Father
    forgive your trespasses.

  # Matthew 5:17
  Moreover, when you fast,
  do not be like the hypocrites,
  with a sad countenance.

  For they disfigure their faces
  that they may appear to men to be fasting.

  Assuredly, I say to you,
  they have their reward.

  # Matthew 5:18
  But you, when you fast,
  anoint your head and wash your face,
  # Matthew 5:19
  so that you do not appear to men to be fasting,
  but to your Father who is in the secret place;
  and your Father who sees in secret
  will reward you openly.

  # Matthew 5:20
  Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth,
  where moth and rust destroy
  and where thieves break in and steal;
  # Matthew 5:21
  but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
  where neither moth nor rust destroys
  and where thieves do not break in and steal.

  # Matthew 5:22
  For where your treasure is,
  there your heart will be also.

  # Matthew 5:23
  The lamp of the body is the eye.

  If therefore your eye is good,
  your whole body will be full of light.

  # Matthew 5:24
  But if your eye is bad,
  your whole body will be full of darkness.

  If therefore the light that is in you
    is darkness,
  how great is that darkness!

  # Matthew 5:25
  No one can serve two masters;
  for either he will hate the one
    and love the other,
  or else he will be loyal to the one
    and despise the other.

  You cannot serve God and mammon.

  # Matthew 5:26
  Therefore I say to you,
  do not worry about your life,
  what you will eat or what you will drink;
  nor about your body,
  what you will put on.

  Is not life more than food
  and the body more than clothing?

  # Matthew 5:27
  Look at the birds of the air,
  for they neither sow
  nor reap
  nor gather into barns;
  yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

  Are you not of more value than they?

  # Matthew 5:28
  Which of you by worrying
  can add one cubit to his stature?

  # Matthew 5:29
  So why do you worry about clothing?

  Consider the lilies of the field,
  how they grow:
  they neither toil nor spin;
  # Matthew 5:30
  and yet I say to you
  that even Solomon in all his glory
  was not arrayed like one of these.

  # Matthew 5:31
  Now if God
  so clothes the grass of the field,
  which today is,
  and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,
  will He not much more clothe you,
  O you of little faith?

  # Matthew 5:32
  Therefore do not worry, saying,
  {
    What shall we eat?
  }
  or
  {
    What shall we drink?
  }
  or
  {
    What shall we wear?
  }

  # Matthew 5:33
  For after all these things the Gentiles seek.

  For your heavenly Father
  knows that you need all these things.

  # Matthew 5:34
  But seek first the kingdom of God
  and His righteousness,
  and all these things shall be added to you.

  # Matthew 5:35
  Therefore do not worry about tomorrow,
  for tomorrow will worry about its own things.

  Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

  # Matthew 6:1
  Judge not, that you be not judged.

  # Matthew 6:2
  For with what judgment you judge,
  you will be judged;
  and with the measure you use,
  it will be measured back to you.

  # Matthew 6:3
  And why do you look at the speck
    in your brother's eye,
  but do not consider the plank
    in your own eye?

  # Matthew 6:4
  Or how can you say to your brother,
  {
    Let me remove the speck from your eye
  };
  and look, a plank is in your own eye?

  # Matthew 6:5
  Hypocrite!

  First remove the plank from your own eye,
  and then you will see clearly
  to remove the speck from your brother's eye.

  # Matthew 6:6
  Do not give what is holy to the dogs;
  nor cast your pearls before swine,
  lest they trample them under their feet,
  and turn and tear you in pieces.

  # Matthew 6:7
  Ask, and it will be given to you;
  seek, and you will find;
  knock, and it will be opened to you.

  # Matthew 6:8
  For everyone who asks receives,
  and he who seeks finds,
  and to him who knocks it will be opened.

  # Matthew 6:9
  Or what man is there among you who,
  if his son asks for bread,
  will give him a stone?

  # Matthew 6:10
  Or if he asks for a fish,
  will he give him a serpent?

  # Matthew 6:11
  If you then, being evil,
  know how to give good gifts to your children,
  how much more will your Father
  who is in heaven
  give good things to those who ask Him!

  # Matthew 6:12
  Therefore,
  whatever you want men to do to you,
  do also to them,
  for this is the Law and the Prophets.

  # Matthew 6:13
  Enter by the narrow gate;
  for wide is the gate
  and broad is the way
  that leads to destruction,
  and there are many who go in by it.

  # Matthew 6:14
  Because narrow is the gate
  and difficult is the way
  which leads to life,
  and there are few who find it.

  # Matthew 6:15
  Beware of false prophets,
  who come to you in sheep's clothing,
  but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.

  # Matthew 6:16
  You will know them by their fruits.

  Do men gather grapes from thornbushes
  or figs from thistles?

  # Matthew 6:17
  Even so, every good tree bears good fruit,
  but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

  # Matthew 6:18
  A good tree cannot bear bad fruit,
  nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.

  # Matthew 6:19
  Every tree that does not bear good fruit
  is cut down and thrown into the fire.

  # Matthew 6:20
  Therefore by their fruits you will know them.

  # Matthew 6:21
  Not everyone who says to Me,
  {
    Lord, Lord,
  }
  shall enter the kingdom of heaven,
  but he who does
  the will of My Father in heaven.

  # Matthew 6:22
  Many will say to Me in that day,
  {
    Lord, Lord,
    have we not prophesied in Your name,
    cast out demons in Your name,
    and done many wonders in Your name?
  }

  # Matthew 6:23
  And then I will declare to them,
  {
    I never knew you;
    depart from Me,
    you who practice lawlessness!
  }

  # Matthew 6:24
  Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine,
  and does them,
  I will liken him to a wise man
  who built his house on the rock:
  # Matthew 6:25
  and the rain descended,
  the floods came,
  and the winds blew and beat on that house;
  and it did not fall,
  for it was founded on the rock.

  # Matthew 6:26
  But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine,
  and does not do them,
  will be like a foolish man
  who built his house on the sand:
  # Matthew 6:27
  and the rain descended,
  the floods came,
  and the winds blew and beat on that house;
  and it fell.

  And great was its fall.
}

# Matthew 6:28
And so it was,
when Jesus had ended these sayings,
that the people were astonished at His teaching,
# Matthew 6:29
for He taught them as one having authority,
and not as the scribes.

# Matthew 7:1
When He had come down from the mountain,
great multitudes followed Him.

# Matthew 7:2
And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him,
saying,
{
  Lord, if You are willing,
  You can make me clean.
}

# Matthew 7:3
Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him,
saying,
{
  I am willing; be cleansed.
}

Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

# Matthew 7:4
And Jesus said to him,
{
  See that you tell no one;
  but go your way,
  show yourself to the priest,
  and offer the gift that Moses commanded,
  as a testimony to them.
}

# Matthew 7:5
Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum,
a centurion came to Him,
pleading with Him,
# Matthew 7:6
saying,
{
  Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed,
  dreadfully tormented.
}

# Matthew 7:7
And Jesus said to him,
{
  I will come and heal him.
}

# Matthew 7:8
The centurion answered and said,
{
  Lord, I am not worthy
  that You should come under my roof.

  But only speak a word,
  and my servant will be healed.

  # Matthew 7:9
  For I also am a man under authority,
  having soldiers under me.

  And I say to this one,
  {
    Go,
  }
  and he goes;
  and to another,
  {
    Come,
  }
  and he comes;
  and to my servant,
  {
    Do this,
  }
  and he does it.
}

# Matthew 7:10
When Jesus heard it, He marveled,
and said to those who followed,
{
  Assuredly, I say to you,
  I have not found such great faith,
  not even in Israel!

  # Matthew 7:11
  And I say to you
  that many will come from east and west,
  and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
  in the kingdom of heaven.

  # Matthew 7:12
  But the sons of the kingdom
  will be cast out into outer darkness.

  There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
}

# Matthew 7:13
Then Jesus said to the centurion,
{
  Go your way;
  and as you have believed,
  so let it be done for you.
}

And his servant was healed that same hour.

# Matthew 7:14
Now when Jesus had come into Peter's house,
He saw his wife's mother
lying sick with a fever.

# Matthew 7:15
So He touched her hand,
and the fever left her.

And she arose and served them.

# Matthew 7:16
When evening had come,
they brought to Him
many who were demon-possessed.

And He cast out the spirits with a word,
and healed all who were sick,
# Matthew 7:17
that it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet,
saying:
{
  He Himself took our infirmities
  And bore our sicknesses.
}

# Matthew 7:18
And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him,
He gave a command to depart to the other side.

# Matthew 7:19
Then a certain scribe came and said to Him,
{
  Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.
}

# Matthew 7:20
And Jesus said to him,
{
  Foxes have holes
  and birds of the air have nests,
  but the Son of Man
  has nowhere to lay His head.
}

# Matthew 7:21
Then another of His disciples said to Him,
{
  Lord, let me first go and bury my father.
}

# Matthew 7:22
But Jesus said to him,
{
  Follow Me,
  and let the dead bury their own dead.
}

# Matthew 7:23
Now when He got into a boat,
His disciples followed Him.

# Matthew 7:24
And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea,
so that the boat was covered with the waves.

But He was asleep.

# Matthew 7:25
Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him,
saying,
{
  Lord, save us!

  We are perishing!
}

# Matthew 7:26
But He said to them,
{
  Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?
}

Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea,
and there was a great calm.

# Matthew 7:27
So the men marveled, saying,
{
  Who can this be,
  that even the winds and the sea obey Him?
}

# Matthew 7:28
When He had come to the other side,
to the country of the Gergesenes,
there met Him two demon-possessed men,
coming out of the tombs,
exceedingly fierce,
so that no one could pass that way.

# Matthew 7:29
And suddenly they cried out, saying,
{
  What have we to do with You,
  Jesus, You Son of God?

  Have You come here
  to torment us before the time?
}

# Matthew 7:30
Now a good way off from them
there was a herd of many swine feeding.

# Matthew 7:31
So the demons begged Him, saying,
{
  If You cast us out,
  permit us to go away into the herd of swine.
}

# Matthew 7:32
And He said to them,
{
  Go.
}

So when they had come out,
they went into the herd of swine.

And suddenly the whole herd of swine
ran violently down the steep place into the sea,
and perished in the water.

# Matthew 7:33
Then those who kept them fled;
and they went away into the city
and told everything,
including what had happened
to the demon-possessed men.

# Matthew 7:34
And behold,
the whole city came out to meet Jesus.

And when they saw Him,
they begged Him to depart from their region.

# Matthew 8:1
So He got into a boat,
crossed over,
and came to His own city.

# Matthew 8:2
Then behold,
they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed.

When Jesus saw their faith,
He said to the paralytic,
{
  Son, be of good cheer;
  your sins are forgiven you.
}

# Matthew 8:3
And at once
some of the scribes said within themselves,
{
  This Man blasphemes!
}

# Matthew 8:4
But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said,
{
  Why do you think evil in your hearts?

  # Matthew 8:5
  For which is easier, to say,
  {
    Your sins are forgiven you,
  }
  or to say,
  {
    Arise and walk
  }?

  # Matthew 8:6
  But that you may know that the Son of Man
  has power on earth to forgive sins
}--
then He said to the paralytic,
{
  Arise, take up your bed,
  and go to your house.
}

# Matthew 8:7
And he arose and departed to his house.

# Matthew 8:8
Now when the multitudes saw it,
they marveled and glorified God,
who had given such power to men.

# Matthew 8:9
As Jesus passed on from there,
He saw a man named Matthew
sitting at the tax office.

And He said to him,
{
  Follow Me.
}

So he arose and followed Him.

# Matthew 8:10
Now it happened,
as Jesus sat at the table in the house,
that behold,
many tax collectors and sinners
came and sat down with Him and His disciples.

# Matthew 8:11
And when the Pharisees saw it,
they said to His disciples,
{
  Why does your Teacher
  eat with tax collectors and sinners?
}

# Matthew 8:12
When Jesus heard that,
He said to them,
{
  Those who are well
  have no need of a physician,
  but those who are sick.

  # Matthew 8:13
  But go and learn what this means:
  {
    I desire mercy and not sacrifice.
  }

  For I did not come to call the righteous,
  but sinners, to repentance.
}

# Matthew 8:14
Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying,
{
  Why do we and the Pharisees fast often,
  but Your disciples do not fast?
}

# # Matthew 8:15
# And Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn
#   as long as the bridegroom is with them?

#   But the days will come when the bridegroom
#   will be taken away from them,
#   and then they will fast.

#   # Matthew 8:16
#   No one puts
#   a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment;
#   for the patch pulls away from the garment,
#   and the tear is made worse.

#   # Matthew 8:17
#   Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins,
#   or else the wineskins break,
#   the wine is spilled,
#   and the wineskins are ruined.

#   But they put new wine into new wineskins,
#   and both are preserved.
# }

# # Matthew 8:18
# While He spoke these things to them,
# behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying,
# {
#   My daughter has just died,
#   but come and lay Your hand on her
#   and she will live.
# }

# # Matthew 8:19
# So Jesus arose and followed him,
# and so did His disciples.

# # Matthew 8:20
# And suddenly,
# a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years
# came from behind
# and touched the hem of His garment.

# # Matthew 8:21
# For she said to herself,
# {
#   If only I may touch His garment,
#   I shall be made well.
# }

# # Matthew 8:22
# But Jesus turned around,
# and when He saw her He said,
# {
#   Be of good cheer, daughter;
#   your faith has made you well.
# }

# And the woman was made well from that hour.

# # Matthew 8:23
# When Jesus came into the ruler's house,
# and saw the flute players
# and the noisy crowd wailing,
# # Matthew 8:24
# He said to them,
# {
#   Make room,
#   for the girl is not dead, but sleeping.
# }

# And they ridiculed Him.

# # Matthew 8:25
# But when the crowd was put outside,
# He went in and took her by the hand,
# and the girl arose.

# # Matthew 8:26
# And the report of this went out
# into all that land.

# # Matthew 8:27
# When Jesus departed from there,
# two blind men followed Him,
# crying out and saying,
# {
#   Son of David, have mercy on us!
# }

# # Matthew 8:28
# And when He had come into the house,
# the blind men came to Him.

# And Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Do you believe that I am able to do this?
# }

# They said to Him,
# {
#   Yes, Lord.
# }

# # Matthew 8:29
# Then He touched their eyes, saying,
# {
#   According to your faith let it be to you.
# }

# # Matthew 8:30
# And their eyes were opened.

# And Jesus sternly warned them, saying,
# {
#   See that no one knows it.
# }

# # Matthew 8:31
# But when they had departed,
# they spread the news about Him
# in all that country.

# # Matthew 8:32
# As they went out,
# behold,
# they brought to Him a man,
# mute and demon-possessed.

# # Matthew 8:33
# And when the demon was cast out,
# the mute spoke.

# And the multitudes marveled, saying,
# {
#   It was never seen like this in Israel!
# }

# # Matthew 8:34
# But the Pharisees said,
# {
#   He casts out demons
#   by the ruler of the demons.
# }

# # Matthew 8:35
# Then Jesus went about
# all the cities and villages,
# teaching in their synagogues,
# preaching the gospel of the kingdom,
# and healing every sickness and every disease
# among the people.

# # Matthew 8:36
# But when He saw the multitudes,
# He was moved with compassion for them,
# because they were weary and scattered,
# like sheep having no shepherd.

# # Matthew 8:37
# Then He said to His disciples,
# {
#   The harvest truly is plentiful,
#   but the laborers are few.

#   # Matthew 8:38
#   Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest
#   to send out laborers into His harvest.
# }

# # Matthew 9:1
# And when He had called
# His twelve disciples to Him,
# He gave them power over unclean spirits,
# to cast them out,
# and to heal all kinds of sickness
# and all kinds of disease.

# # Matthew 9:2
# Now the names of the twelve apostles are these:
# first, Simon, who is called Peter,
# and Andrew his brother;
# James the son of Zebedee,
# and John his brother;
# # Matthew 9:3
# Philip and Bartholomew;
# Thomas and Matthew the tax collector;
# James the son of Alphaeus,
# and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
# # Matthew 9:4
# Simon the Cananite,
# and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.

# # Matthew 9:5
# These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them,
# saying:
# {
#   Do not go into the way of the Gentiles,
#   and do not enter a city of the Samaritans.

#   # Matthew 9:6
#   But go rather to the lost sheep
#   of the house of Israel.

#   # Matthew 9:7
#   And as you go, preach, saying,
#   {
#     The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
#   }

#   # Matthew 9:8
#   Heal the sick,
#   cleanse the lepers,
#   raise the dead,
#   cast out demons.

#   Freely you have received, freely give.

#   # Matthew 9:9
#   Provide neither gold nor silver nor copper
#   in your money belts,
#   # Matthew 9:10
#   nor bag for your journey,
#   nor two tunics,
#   nor sandals,
#   nor staffs;
#   for a worker is worthy of his food.

#   # Matthew 9:11
#   Now whatever city or town you enter,
#   inquire who in it is worthy,
#   and stay there till you go out.

#   # Matthew 9:12
#   And when you go into a household, greet it.

#   # Matthew 9:13
#   If the household is worthy,
#   let your peace come upon it.

#   But if it is not worthy,
#   let your peace return to you.

#   # Matthew 9:14
#   And whoever will not receive you
#   nor hear your words,
#   when you depart from that house or city,
#   shake off the dust from your feet.

#   # Matthew 9:15
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   it will be more tolerable
#   for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah
#   in the day of judgment than for that city!

#   # Matthew 9:16
#   Behold,
#   I send you out
#   as sheep
#   in the midst of wolves.

#   Therefore be wise as serpents
#   and harmless as doves.

#   # Matthew 9:17
#   But beware of men,
#   for they will deliver you up to councils
#   and scourge you in their synagogues.

#   # Matthew 9:18
#   You will be brought
#   before governors and kings for My sake,
#   as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

#   # Matthew 9:19
#   But when they deliver you up,
#   do not worry about
#   how or what you should speak.

#   For it will be given to you in that hour
#   what you should speak;
#   # Matthew 9:20
#   for it is not you who speak,
#   but the Spirit of your Father
#   who speaks in you.

#   # Matthew 9:21
#   Now brother will deliver up brother to death,
#   and a father his child;
#   and children will rise up against parents
#   and cause them to be put to death.

#   # Matthew 9:22
#   And you will be hated by all
#   for My name's sake.

#   But he who endures to the end will be saved.

#   # Matthew 9:23
#   When they persecute you in this city,
#   flee to another.

#   For assuredly, I say to you,
#   you will not have gone
#   through the cities of Israel
#   before the Son of Man comes.

#   # Matthew 9:24
#   A disciple is not above his teacher,
#   nor a servant above his master.

#   # Matthew 9:25
#   It is enough for a disciple
#   that he be like his teacher,
#   and a servant like his master.

#   If they have called the master of the house
#   Beelzebub,
#   how much more will they call
#   those of his household!

#   # Matthew 9:26
#   Therefore do not fear them.

#   For there is nothing covered
#   that will not be revealed,
#   and hidden that will not be known.

#   # Matthew 9:27
#   Whatever I tell you in the dark,
#   speak in the light;
#   and what you hear in the ear,
#   preach on the housetops.

#   # Matthew 9:28
#   And do not fear those who kill the body
#   but cannot kill the soul.

#   But rather fear Him
#   who is able to destroy
#   both soul and body in hell.

#   # Matthew 9:29
#   Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin?

#   And not one of them falls to the ground
#   apart from your Father's will.

#   # Matthew 9:30
#   But the very hairs of your head
#   are all numbered.

#   # Matthew 9:31
#   Do not fear therefore;
#   you are of more value than many sparrows.

#   # Matthew 9:32
#   Therefore whoever confesses Me before men,
#   him I will also confess
#   before My Father who is in heaven.

#   # Matthew 9:33
#   But whoever denies Me before men,
#   him I will also deny
#   before My Father who is in heaven.

#   # Matthew 9:34
#   Do not think that I came
#   to bring peace on earth.

#   I did not come to bring peace but a sword.

#   # Matthew 9:35
#   For I have come to
#   {
#     set a man
#       against his father,
#     a daughter
#       against her mother,
#     and a daughter-in-law
#       against her mother-in-law
#   };
#   # Matthew 9:36
#   and
#   {
#     a man's enemies
#     will be those of his own household.
#   }

#   # Matthew 9:37
#   He who loves father or mother more than Me
#   is not worthy of Me.

#   And he who loves son or daughter more than Me
#   is not worthy of Me.

#   # Matthew 9:38
#   And he who does not take his cross
#   and follow after Me
#   is not worthy of Me.

#   # Matthew 9:39
#   He who finds his life
#     will lose it,
#   and he who loses his life for My sake
#     will find it.

#   # Matthew 9:40
#   He who receives you
#     receives Me,
#   and he who receives Me
#     receives Him who sent Me.

#   # Matthew 9:41
#   He who receives a prophet
#   in the name of a prophet
#   shall receive a prophet's reward.

#   And he who receives a righteous man
#   in the name of a righteous man
#   shall receive a righteous man's reward.

#   # Matthew 9:42
#   And whoever gives one of these little ones
#   only a cup of cold water
#   in the name of a disciple,
#   assuredly, I say to you,
#   he shall by no means lose his reward.
# }

# # Matthew 10:1
# Now it came to pass,
# when Jesus finished commanding
# His twelve disciples,
# that He departed from there
# to teach and to preach in their cities.

# # Matthew 10:2
# And when John had heard in prison
# about the works of Christ,
# he sent two of his disciples
# # Matthew 10:3
# and said to Him,
# {
#   Are You the Coming One,
#   or do we look for another?
# }

# # Matthew 10:4
# Jesus answered and said to them,
# {
#   Go and tell John
#   the things which you hear and see:

#   # Matthew 10:5
#   The blind
#     see
#   and the lame
#     walk;
#   the lepers
#     are cleansed
#   and the deaf
#     hear;
#   the dead
#     are raised up
#   and the poor
#     have the gospel preached to them.

#   And blessed is he who is not offended
#   because of Me.
# }

# # Matthew 10:6
# As they departed,
# Jesus began to say to the multitudes
# concerning John:
# {
#   What did you go out into the wilderness
#   to see?

#   A reed shaken by the wind?

#   # Matthew 10:7
#   But what did you go out to see?

#   A man clothed in soft garments?

#   Indeed,
#   those who wear soft clothing
#   are in kings' houses.

#   # Matthew 10:8
#   But what did you go out to see?

#   A prophet?

#   Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.

#   # Matthew 10:9
#   For this is he of whom it is written:
#   {
#     Behold,
#     I send My messenger before Your face,
#     Who will prepare Your way before You.
#   }

#   # Matthew 10:10
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   among those born of women
#   there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist;
#   but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven
#   is greater than he.

#   # Matthew 10:11
#   And from the days of John the Baptist until now
#   the kingdom of heaven suffers violence,
#   and the violent take it by force.

#   # Matthew 10:12
#   For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

#   # Matthew 10:13
#   And if you are willing to receive it,
#   he is Elijah who is to come.

#   # Matthew 10:14
#   He who has ears to hear, let him hear!

#   # Matthew 10:15
#   But to what shall I liken this generation?

#   It is like children
#   sitting in the marketplaces
#   and calling to their companions,
#   # Matthew 10:16
#   and saying:
#   {
#     We played the flute for you,
#     And you did not dance;
#     We mourned to you,
#     And you did not lament.
#   }

#   # Matthew 10:17
#   For John came neither eating nor drinking,
#   and they say,
#   {
#     He has a demon.
#   }

#   # Matthew 10:18
#   The Son of Man came eating and drinking,
#   and they say,
#   {
#     Look, a glutton and a winebibber,
#     a friend of tax collectors and sinners!
#   }

#   But wisdom is justified by her children.
# }

# # Matthew 10:19
# Then He began to rebuke the cities
# in which most of His mighty works had been done,
# because they did not repent:
# {
#   # Matthew 10:20
#   Woe to you, Chorazin!

#   Woe to you, Bethsaida!

#   For if the mighty works
#   which were done in you
#   had been done in Tyre and Sidon,
#   they would have repented long ago
#   in sackcloth and ashes.

#   # Matthew 10:21
#   But I say to you,
#   it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon
#   in the day of judgment
#   than for you.

#   # Matthew 10:22
#   And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven,
#   will be brought down to Hades;
#   for if the mighty works which were done in you
#   had been done in Sodom,
#   it would have remained until this day.

#   # Matthew 10:23
#   But I say to you
#   that it shall be more tolerable
#   for the land of Sodom
#   in the day of judgment
#   than for you.
# }

# # Matthew 10:24
# At that time Jesus answered and said,
# {
#   I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
#   that You have hidden these things
#   from the wise and prudent
#   and have revealed them to babes.

#   # Matthew 10:25
#   Even so, Father,
#   for so it seemed good in Your sight.

#   # Matthew 10:26
#   All things have been delivered to Me
#   by My Father,
#   and no one knows the Son except the Father.

#   Nor does anyone know the Father
#   except the Son,
#   and the one
#   to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.

#   # Matthew 10:27
#   Come to Me,
#   all you who labor and are heavy laden,
#   and I will give you rest.

#   # Matthew 10:28
#   Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me,
#   for I am gentle and lowly in heart,
#   and you will find rest for your souls.

#   # Matthew 10:29
#   For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.
# }

# # Matthew 11:1
# At that time Jesus went through the grainfields
# on the Sabbath.

# And His disciples were hungry,
# and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.

# # Matthew 11:2
# And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him,
# {
#   Look, Your disciples are doing
#   what is not lawful to do
#   on the Sabbath!
# }

# # Matthew 11:3
# But He said to them,
# {
#   Have you not read
#   what David did when he was hungry,
#   he and those who were with him:
#   # Matthew 11:4
#   how he entered the house of God
#   and ate the showbread
#   which was not lawful for him to eat,
#   nor for those who were with him,
#   but only for the priests?

#   # Matthew 11:5
#   Or have you not read in the law
#   that on the Sabbath
#   the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath,
#   and are blameless?

#   # Matthew 11:6
#   Yet I say to you that in this place
#   there is One greater than the temple.

#   # Matthew 11:7
#   But if you had known what this means,
#   {
#     I desire mercy and not sacrifice,
#   }
#   you would not have condemned the guiltless.

#   # Matthew 11:8
#   For the Son of Man
#   is Lord even of the Sabbath.
# }

# # Matthew 11:9
# Now when He had departed from there,
# He went into their synagogue.

# # Matthew 11:10
# And behold,
# there was a man who had a withered hand.

# And they asked Him, saying,
# {
#   Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?
# }--
# that they might accuse Him.

# # Matthew 11:11
# Then He said to them,
# {
#   What man is there among you who has one sheep,
#   and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath,
#   will not lay hold of it and lift it out?

#   # Matthew 11:12
#   Of how much more value then
#   is a man than a sheep?

#   Therefore
#   it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.
# }

# # Matthew 11:13
# Then He said to the man,
# {
#   Stretch out your hand.
# }

# And he stretched it out,
# and it was restored as whole as the other.

# # Matthew 11:14
# Then the Pharisees went out
# and plotted against Him,
# how they might destroy Him.

# # Matthew 11:15
# But when Jesus knew it,
# He withdrew from there.

# And great multitudes followed Him,
# and He healed them all.

# # Matthew 11:16
# Yet He warned them not to make Him known,
# # Matthew 11:17
# that it might be fulfilled
# which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet,
# saying:
# {
#   # Matthew 11:18
#   Behold!

#   My Servant whom I have chosen,
#   My Beloved in whom My soul is well pleased!

#   I will put My Spirit upon Him,
#   And He will declare justice to the Gentiles.

#   # Matthew 11:19
#   He will not quarrel nor cry out,
#   Nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.

#   # Matthew 11:20
#   A bruised reed He will not break,
#   And smoking flax He will not quench,
#   Till He sends forth justice to victory;

#   # Matthew 11:21
#   And in His name Gentiles will trust.
# }

# # Matthew 11:22
# Then one was brought to Him
# who was demon-possessed, blind and mute;
# and He healed him,
# so that the blind and mute man
# both spoke and saw.

# # Matthew 11:23
# And all the multitudes were amazed and said,
# {
#   Could this be the Son of David?
# }

# # Matthew 11:24
# Now when the Pharisees heard it they said,
# {
#   This fellow does not cast out demons
#   except by Beelzebub,
#   the ruler of the demons.
# }

# # Matthew 11:25
# But Jesus knew their thoughts,
# and said to them:
# {
#   Every kingdom divided against itself
#     is brought to desolation,
#   and every city or house divided against itself
#     will not stand.

#   # Matthew 11:26
#   If Satan casts out Satan,
#   he is divided against himself.

#   How then will his kingdom stand?

#   # Matthew 11:27
#   And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub,
#   by whom do your sons cast them out?

#   Therefore they shall be your judges.

#   # Matthew 11:28
#   But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God,
#   surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.

#   # Matthew 11:29
#   Or how can one enter a strong man's house
#   and plunder his goods,
#   unless he first binds the strong man?

#   And then he will plunder his house.

#   # Matthew 11:30
#   He who is not with Me
#     is against Me,
#   and he who does not gather with Me
#     scatters abroad.

#   # Matthew 11:31
#   Therefore I say to you,
#   every sin and blasphemy
#     will be forgiven men,
#   but the blasphemy against the Spirit
#     will not be forgiven men.

#   # Matthew 11:32
#   Anyone who speaks a word
#   against the Son of Man,
#   it will be forgiven him;
#   but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit,
#   it will not be forgiven him,
#   either in this age or in the age to come.

#   # Matthew 11:33
#   Either make the tree good and its fruit good,
#   or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad;
#   for a tree is known by its fruit.

#   # Matthew 11:34
#   Brood of vipers!

#   How can you, being evil, speak good things?

#   For out of the abundance of the heart
#   the mouth speaks.

#   # Matthew 11:35
#   A good man
#   out of the good treasure of his heart
#   brings forth good things,
#   and an evil man
#   out of the evil treasure
#   brings forth evil things.

#   # Matthew 11:36
#   But I say to you
#   that for every idle word men may speak,
#   they will give account of it
#   in the day of judgment.

#   # Matthew 11:37
#   For by your words you will be justified,
#   and by your words you will be condemned.
# }

# # Matthew 11:38
# Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered,
# saying,
# {
#   Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.
# }

# # Matthew 11:39
# But He answered and said to them,
# {
#   An evil and adulterous generation
#   seeks after a sign,
#   and no sign will be given to it
#   except the sign of the prophet Jonah.

#   # Matthew 11:40
#   For as Jonah
#     was three days and three nights
#     in the belly of the great fish,
#   so will the Son of Man
#     be three days and three nights
#     in the heart of the earth.

#   # Matthew 11:41
#   The men of Nineveh will rise up
#   in the judgment
#   with this generation
#   and condemn it,
#   because they repented
#   at the preaching of Jonah;
#   and indeed a greater than Jonah is here.

#   # Matthew 11:42
#   The queen of the South will rise up
#   in the judgment
#   with this generation
#   and condemn it,
#   for she came from the ends of the earth
#   to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
#   and indeed a greater than Solomon is here.

#   # Matthew 11:43
#   When an unclean spirit goes out of a man,
#   he goes through dry places,
#   seeking rest,
#   and finds none.

#   # Matthew 11:44
#   Then he says,
#   {
#     I will return to my house from which I came.
#   }

#   And when he comes,
#   he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.

#   # Matthew 11:45
#   Then he goes
#   and takes with him seven other spirits
#   more wicked than himself,
#   and they enter and dwell there;
#   and the last state of that man
#   is worse than the first.

#   So shall it also be
#   with this wicked generation.
# }

# # Matthew 11:46
# While He was still talking to the multitudes,
# behold,
# His mother and brothers stood outside,
# seeking to speak with Him.

# # Matthew 11:47
# Then one said to Him,
# {
#   Look,
#   Your mother and Your brothers
#   are standing outside,
#   seeking to speak with You.
# }

# # Matthew 11:48
# But He answered
# and said to the one who told Him,
# {
#   Who is My mother and who are My brothers?
# }

# # Matthew 11:49
# And He stretched out His hand
# toward His disciples
# and said,
# {
#   Here are My mother and My brothers!

#   # Matthew 11:50
#   For whoever does
#   the will of My Father in heaven
#   is My brother and sister and mother.
# }

# # Matthew 12:1
# On the same day Jesus went out of the house
# and sat by the sea.

# # Matthew 12:2
# And great multitudes
# were gathered together to Him,
# so that He got into a boat and sat;
# and the whole multitude stood on the shore.

# # Matthew 12:3
# Then He spoke many things to them in parables,
# saying:
# {
#   Behold, a sower went out to sow.

#   # Matthew 12:4
#   And as he sowed,
#   some seed fell by the wayside;
#   and the birds came and devoured them.

#   # Matthew 12:5
#   Some fell on stony places,
#   where they did not have much earth;
#   and they immediately sprang up
#   because they had no depth of earth.

#   # Matthew 12:6
#   But when the sun was up
#     they were scorched,
#   and because they had no root
#     they withered away.

#   # Matthew 12:7
#   And some fell among thorns,
#   and the thorns sprang up and choked them.

#   # Matthew 12:8
#   But others fell on good ground
#   and yielded a crop:
#   some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.

#   # Matthew 12:9
#   He who has ears to hear, let him hear!
# }

# # Matthew 12:10
# And the disciples came and said to Him,
# {
#   Why do You speak to them in parables?
# }

# # Matthew 12:11
# He answered and said to them,
# {
#   Because it has been given to you
#   to know the mysteries
#   of the kingdom of heaven,
#   but to them it has not been given.

#   # Matthew 12:12
#   For whoever has,
#   to him more will be given,
#   and he will have abundance;
#   but whoever does not have,
#   even what he has will be taken away from him.

#   # Matthew 12:13
#   Therefore I speak to them in parables,
#   because seeing they do not see,
#   and hearing they do not hear,
#   nor do they understand.

#   # Matthew 12:14
#   And in them
#   the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled,
#   which says:
#   {
#     Hearing you will hear
#       and shall not understand,
#     And seeing you will see
#       and not perceive;

#     # Matthew 12:15
#     For the hearts of this people
#       have grown dull.

#     Their ears are hard of hearing,
#     And their eyes they have closed,
#     Lest they should
#       see with their eyes
#       and hear with their ears,
#     Lest they should
#       understand with their hearts
#       and turn,
#     So that I should heal them.
#   }

#   # Matthew 12:16
#   But blessed are your eyes for they see,
#   and your ears for they hear;
#   # Matthew 12:17
#   for assuredly, I say to you
#   that many prophets and righteous men
#   desired to see what you see,
#   and did not see it,
#   and to hear what you hear,
#   and did not hear it.

#   # Matthew 12:18
#   Therefore hear the parable of the sower:

#   # Matthew 12:19
#   When anyone hears the word of the kingdom,
#   and does not understand it,
#   then the wicked one comes and snatches away
#   what was sown in his heart.

#   This is he who received seed by the wayside.

#   # Matthew 12:20
#   But he who received the seed on stony places,
#   this is he who hears the word
#   and immediately receives it with joy;
#   # Matthew 12:21
#   yet he has no root in himself,
#   but endures only for a while.

#   For when tribulation or persecution arises
#   because of the word,
#   immediately he stumbles.

#   # Matthew 12:22
#   Now he who received seed among the thorns
#   is he who hears the word,
#   and the cares of this world
#   and the deceitfulness of riches
#   choke the word,
#   and he becomes unfruitful.

#   # Matthew 12:23
#   But he who received seed on the good ground
#   is he who hears the word and understands it,
#   who indeed bears fruit and produces:
#   some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
# }

# # Matthew 12:24
# Another parable He put forth to them, saying:
# {
#   The kingdom of heaven is like a man
#   who sowed good seed in his field;
#   # Matthew 12:25
#   but while men slept,
#   his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat
#   and went his way.

#   # Matthew 12:26
#   But when the grain had sprouted
#   and produced a crop,
#   then the tares also appeared.

#   # Matthew 12:27
#   So the servants of the owner came
#   and said to him,
#   {
#     Sir,
#     did you not sow good seed in your field?

#     How then does it have tares?
#   }

#   # Matthew 12:28
#   He said to them,
#   {
#     An enemy has done this.
#   }

#   The servants said to him,
#   {
#     Do you want us then
#     to go and gather them up?
#   }

#   # Matthew 12:29
#   But he said,
#   {
#     No, lest while you gather up the tares
#     you also uproot the wheat with them.

#     # Matthew 12:30
#     Let both grow together until the harvest,
#     and at the time of harvest
#     I will say to the reapers,
#     {
#       First gather together the tares
#       and bind them in bundles to burn them,
#       but gather the wheat into my barn.
#     }
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 12:31
# Another parable He put forth to them, saying:
# {
#   The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed,
#   which a man took and sowed in his field,
#   # Matthew 12:32
#   which indeed is the least of all the seeds;
#   but when it is grown
#   it is greater than the herbs
#   and becomes a tree,
#   so that the birds of the air
#   come and nest in its branches.
# }

# # Matthew 12:33
# Another parable He spoke to them:
# {
#   The kingdom of heaven is like leaven,
#   which a woman took
#   and hid in three measures of meal
#   till it was all leavened.
# }

# # Matthew 12:34
# All these things
# Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables;
# and without a parable He did not speak to them,
# # Matthew 12:35
# that it might be fulfilled
# which was spoken by the prophet,
# saying:
# {
#   I will open My mouth in parables;
#   I will utter things kept secret
#   from the foundation of the world.
# }

# # Matthew 12:36
# Then Jesus sent the multitude away
# and went into the house.

# And His disciples came to Him, saying,
# {
#   Explain to us
#   the parable of the tares of the field.
# }

# # Matthew 12:37
# He answered and said to them:
# {
#   He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.

#   # Matthew 12:38
#   The field is the world,
#   the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom,
#   but the tares are the sons of the wicked one.

#   # Matthew 12:39
#   The enemy who sowed them is the devil,
#   the harvest is the end of the age,
#   and the reapers are the angels.

#   # Matthew 12:40
#   Therefore
#   as the tares are gathered
#   and burned in the fire,
#   so it will be at the end of this age.

#   # Matthew 12:41
#   The Son of Man will send out His angels,
#   and they will gather out of His kingdom
#   all things that offend,
#   and those who practice lawlessness,
#   # Matthew 12:42
#   and will cast them into the furnace of fire.

#   There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.

#   # Matthew 12:43
#   Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun
#   in the kingdom of their Father.

#   He who has ears to hear, let him hear!

#   # Matthew 12:44
#   Again,
#   the kingdom of heaven
#   is like treasure hidden in a field,
#   which a man found and hid;
#   and for joy over it
#   he goes and sells all that he has
#   and buys that field.

#   # Matthew 12:45
#   Again,
#   the kingdom of heaven
#   is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls,
#   # Matthew 12:46
#   who,
#   when he had found one pearl of great price,
#   went and sold all that he had and bought it.

#   # Matthew 12:47
#   Again,
#   the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet
#   that was cast into the sea
#   and gathered some of every kind,
#   # Matthew 12:48
#   which,
#   when it was full,
#   they drew to shore;
#   and they sat down
#   and gathered the good into vessels,
#   but threw the bad away.

#   # Matthew 12:49
#   So it will be at the end of the age.

#   The angels will come forth,
#   separate the wicked from among the just,
#   # Matthew 12:50
#   and cast them into the furnace of fire.

#   There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
# }

# # Matthew 12:51
# Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Have you understood all these things?
# }

# They said to Him,
# {
#   Yes, Lord.
# }

# # Matthew 12:52
# Then He said to them,
# {
#   Therefore every scribe
#   instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven
#   is like a householder
#   who brings out of his treasure
#   things new and old.
# }

# # Matthew 12:53
# Now it came to pass,
# when Jesus had finished these parables,
# that He departed from there.

# # Matthew 12:54
# And when He had come to His own country,
# He taught them in their synagogue,
# so that they were astonished and said,
# {
#   Where did this Man
#   get this wisdom and these mighty works?

#   # Matthew 12:55
#   Is this not the carpenter's son?

#   Is not His mother called Mary?

#   And His brothers James,
#   Joses, Simon, and Judas?

#   # Matthew 12:56
#   And His sisters, are they not all with us?

#   Where then did this Man get all these things?
# }

# # Matthew 12:57
# So they were offended at Him.

# But Jesus said to them,
# {
#   A prophet is not without honor
#   except in his own country
#   and in his own house.
# }

# # Matthew 12:58
# Now He did not do many mighty works there
# because of their unbelief.

# # Matthew 13:1
# At that time
# Herod the tetrarch heard the report about Jesus
# # Matthew 13:2
# and said to his servants,
# {
#   This is John the Baptist;
#   he is risen from the dead,
#   and therefore these powers are at work in him.
# }

# # Matthew 13:3
# For Herod had laid hold of John and bound him,
# and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias,
# his brother Philip's wife.

# # Matthew 13:4
# Because John had said to him,
# {
#   It is not lawful for you to have her.
# }

# # Matthew 13:5
# And although he wanted to put him to death,
# he feared the multitude,
# because they counted him as a prophet.

# # Matthew 13:6
# But when Herod's birthday was celebrated,
# the daughter of Herodias
# danced before them and pleased Herod.

# # Matthew 13:7
# Therefore he promised with an oath
# to give her whatever she might ask.

# # Matthew 13:8
# So she,
# having been prompted by her mother, said,
# {
#   Give me John the Baptist's head here on a platter.
# }

# # Matthew 13:9
# And the king was sorry;
# nevertheless, because of the oaths
# and because of those who sat with him,
# he commanded it to be given to her.

# # Matthew 13:10
# So he sent and had John beheaded in prison.

# # Matthew 13:11
# And his head was brought on a platter
# and given to the girl,
# and she brought it to her mother.

# # Matthew 13:12
# Then his disciples came
# and took away the body and buried it,
# and went and told Jesus.

# # Matthew 13:13
# When Jesus heard it,
# He departed from there by boat
# to a deserted place by Himself.

# But when the multitudes heard it,
# they followed Him on foot from the cities.

# # Matthew 13:14
# And when Jesus went out
# He saw a great multitude;
# and He was moved with compassion for them,
# and healed their sick.

# # Matthew 13:15
# When it was evening,
# His disciples came to Him, saying,
# {
#   This is a deserted place,
#   and the hour is already late.

#   Send the multitudes away,
#   that they may go into the villages
#   and buy themselves food.
# }

# # Matthew 13:16
# But Jesus said to them,
# {
#   They do not need to go away.

#   You give them something to eat.
# }

# # Matthew 13:17
# And they said to Him,
# {
#   We have here only five loaves and two fish.
# }

# # Matthew 13:18
# He said,
# {
#   Bring them here to Me.
# }

# # Matthew 13:19
# Then He commanded the multitudes
# to sit down on the grass.

# And He took the five loaves and the two fish,
# and looking up to heaven,
# He blessed and broke
# and gave the loaves to the disciples;
# and the disciples gave to the multitudes.

# # Matthew 13:20
# So they all ate and were filled,
# and they took up twelve baskets
# full of the fragments that remained.

# # Matthew 13:21
# Now those who had eaten were about 5000 men,
# besides women and children.

# # Matthew 13:22
# Immediately
# Jesus made His disciples get into the boat
# and go before Him to the other side,
# while He sent the multitudes away.

# # Matthew 13:23
# And when He had sent the multitudes away,
# He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray.

# Now when evening came, He was alone there.

# # Matthew 13:24
# But the boat was now in the middle of the sea,
# tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.

# # Matthew 13:25
# Now in the fourth watch of the night
# Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.

# # Matthew 13:26
# And when the disciples saw Him
# walking on the sea,
# they were troubled, saying,
# {
#   It is a ghost!
# }

# And they cried out for fear.

# # Matthew 13:27
# But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying,
# {
#   Be of good cheer!

#   It is I; do not be afraid.
# }

# # Matthew 13:28
# And Peter answered Him and said,
# {
#   Lord, if it is You,
#   command me to come to You on the water.
# }

# # Matthew 13:29
# So He said,
# {
#   Come.
# }

# And when Peter had come down out of the boat,
# he walked on the water to go to Jesus.

# # Matthew 13:30
# But when he saw that the wind was boisterous,
# he was afraid;
# and beginning to sink he cried out, saying,
# {
#   Lord, save me!
# }

# # Matthew 13:31
# And immediately
# Jesus stretched out His hand and caught him,
# and said to him,
# {
#   O you of little faith, why did you doubt?
# }

# # Matthew 13:32
# And when they got into the boat,
# the wind ceased.

# # Matthew 13:33
# Then those who were in the boat
# came and worshiped Him, saying,
# {
#   Truly You are the Son of God.
# }

# # Matthew 13:34
# When they had crossed over,
# they came to the land of Gennesaret.

# # Matthew 13:35
# And when the men of that place recognized Him,
# they sent out into all that surrounding region,
# brought to Him all who were sick,
# # Matthew 13:36
# and begged Him that they might only touch
# the hem of His garment.

# And as many as touched it
# were made perfectly well.

# # Matthew 14:1
# Then the scribes and Pharisees
# who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying,
# {
#   # Matthew 14:2
#   Why do Your disciples
#   transgress the tradition of the elders?

#   For they do not wash their hands
#   when they eat bread.
# }

# # Matthew 14:3
# He answered and said to them,
# {
#   Why do you also transgress
#   the commandment of God
#   because of your tradition?

#   # Matthew 14:4
#   For God commanded, saying,
#   {
#     Honor your father and your mother
#   };
#   and,
#   {
#     He who curses father or mother,
#     let him be put to death.
#   }

#   # Matthew 14:5
#   But you say,
#   {
#     Whoever says to his father or mother,
#     {
#       Whatever profit you might have received
#       from me is a gift to God
#     }--
#     # Matthew 14:6
#     then he need not honor his father or mother.
#   }

#   Thus you have made the commandment of God
#   of no effect by your tradition.

#   # Matthew 14:7
#   Hypocrites!

#   Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying:
#   {
#     # Matthew 14:8
#     These people draw near to Me with their mouth,
#     And honor Me with their lips,
#     But their heart is far from Me.

#     # Matthew 14:9
#     And in vain they worship Me,
#     Teaching as doctrines
#       the commandments of men.
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 14:10
# When He had called the multitude to Himself,
# He said to them,
# {
#   Hear and understand:

#   # Matthew 14:11
#   Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man;
#   but what comes out of the mouth,
#   this defiles a man.
# }

# # Matthew 14:12
# Then His disciples came and said to Him,
# {
#   Do You know that the Pharisees were offended
#   when they heard this saying?
# }

# # Matthew 14:13
# But He answered and said,
# {
#   Every plant
#   which My heavenly Father has not planted
#   will be uprooted.

#   # Matthew 14:14
#   Let them alone.

#   They are blind leaders of the blind.

#   And if the blind leads the blind,
#   both will fall into a ditch.
# }

# # Matthew 14:15
# Then Peter answered and said to Him,
# {
#   Explain this parable to us.
# }

# # Matthew 14:16
# So Jesus said,
# {
#   Are you also still without understanding?

#   # Matthew 14:17
#   Do you not yet understand
#   that whatever enters the mouth
#   goes into the stomach
#   and is eliminated?

#   # Matthew 14:18
#   But those things
#   which proceed out of the mouth
#   come from the heart,
#   and they defile a man.

#   # Matthew 14:19
#   For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts,
#   murders,
#   adulteries,
#   fornications,
#   thefts,
#   false witness,
#   blasphemies.

#   # Matthew 14:20
#   These are the things which defile a man,
#   but to eat with unwashed hands
#   does not defile a man.
# }

# # Matthew 14:21
# Then Jesus went out from there
# and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon.

# # Matthew 14:22
# And behold,
# a woman of Canaan came from that region
# and cried out to Him,
# saying,
# {
#   Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David!

#   My daughter is severely demon-possessed.
# }

# # Matthew 14:23
# But He answered her not a word.

# And His disciples came and urged Him, saying,
# {
#   Send her away, for she cries out after us.
# }

# # Matthew 14:24
# But He answered and said,
# {
#   I was not sent except to the lost sheep
#   of the house of Israel.
# }

# # Matthew 14:25
# Then she came and worshiped Him, saying,
# {
#   Lord, help me!
# }

# # Matthew 14:26
# But He answered and said,
# {
#   It is not good to take the children's bread
#   and throw it to the little dogs.
# }

# # Matthew 14:27
# And she said,
# {
#   Yes, Lord,
#   yet even the little dogs
#   eat the crumbs
#   which fall from their masters' table.
# }

# # Matthew 14:28
# Then Jesus answered and said to her,
# {
#   O woman, great is your faith!

#   Let it be to you as you desire.
# }

# And her daughter was healed from that very hour.

# # Matthew 14:29
# Jesus departed from there,
# skirted the Sea of Galilee,
# and went up on the mountain and sat down there.

# # Matthew 14:30
# Then great multitudes came to Him,
# having with them the lame,
# blind,
# mute,
# maimed,
# and many others;
# and they laid them down at Jesus' feet,
# and He healed them.

# # Matthew 14:31
# So the multitude marveled
# when they saw the mute speaking,
# the maimed made whole,
# the lame walking,
# and the blind seeing;
# and they glorified the God of Israel.

# # Matthew 14:32
# Now Jesus called His disciples to Himself
# and said,
# {
#   I have compassion on the multitude,
#   because they have now continued with Me
#   three days
#   and have nothing to eat.

#   And I do not want to send them away hungry,
#   lest they faint on the way.
# }

# # Matthew 14:33
# Then His disciples said to Him,
# {
#   Where could we get enough bread
#   in the wilderness
#   to fill such a great multitude?
# }

# # Matthew 14:34
# Jesus said to them,
# {
#   How many loaves do you have?
# }

# And they said,
# {
#   Seven, and a few little fish.
# }

# # Matthew 14:35
# So He commanded the multitude
# to sit down on the ground.

# # Matthew 14:36
# And He took the seven loaves and the fish
# and gave thanks,
# broke them and gave them to His disciples;
# and the disciples gave to the multitude.

# # Matthew 14:37
# So they all ate and were filled,
# and they took up seven large baskets
# full of the fragments that were left.

# # Matthew 14:38
# Now those who ate were 4000 men,
# besides women and children.

# # Matthew 14:39
# And He sent away the multitude,
# got into the boat,
# and came to the region of Magdala.

# # Matthew 15:1
# Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came,
# and testing Him asked that He would show them
# a sign from heaven.

# # Matthew 15:2
# He answered and said to them,
# {
#   When it is evening you say,
#   {
#     It will be fair weather,
#     for the sky is red
#   };
#   and in the morning,
#   {
#     It will be foul weather today,
#     for the sky is red and threatening.
#   }

#   Hypocrites!

#   You know how to discern the face of the sky,
#   but you cannot discern the signs of the times.

#   # Matthew 15:3
#   A wicked and adulterous generation
#   seeks after a sign,
#   and no sign shall be given to it
#   except the sign of the prophet Jonah.
# }

# And He left them and departed.

# # Matthew 15:4
# Now when His disciples
# had come to the other side,
# they had forgotten to take bread.

# # Matthew 15:5
# Then Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Take heed and beware of the leaven
#   of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
# }

# # Matthew 15:6
# And they reasoned among themselves, saying,
# {
#   It is because we have taken no bread.
# }

# # Matthew 15:7
# But Jesus, being aware of it, said to them,
# {
#   O you of little faith,
#   why do you reason among yourselves
#   because you have brought no bread?

#   # Matthew 15:8
#   Do you not yet understand,
#   or remember the five loaves of the 5000
#   and how many baskets you took up?

#   # Matthew 15:9
#   Nor the seven loaves of the 4000
#   and how many large baskets you took up?

#   # Matthew 15:10
#   How is it you do not understand
#   that I did not speak to you
#   concerning bread?--
#   but to beware of the leaven
#   of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
# }

# # Matthew 15:11
# Then they understood
# that He did not tell them
# to beware of the leaven of bread,
# but of the doctrine
# of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

# # Matthew 15:12
# When Jesus came
# into the region of Caesarea Philippi,
# He asked His disciples, saying,
# {
#   Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?
# }

# # Matthew 15:13
# So they said,
# {
#   Some say John the Baptist,
#   some Elijah,
#   and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
# }

# # Matthew 15:14
# He said to them,
# {
#   But who do you say that I am?
# }

# # Matthew 15:15
# Simon Peter answered and said,
# {
#   You are the Christ,
#   the Son of the living God.
# }

# # Matthew 15:16
# Jesus answered and said to him,
# {
#   Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah,
#   for flesh and blood
#   has not revealed this to you,
#   but My Father who is in heaven.

#   # Matthew 15:17
#   And I also say to you that you are Peter,
#   and on this rock I will build My church,
#   and the gates of Hades
#   shall not prevail against it.

#   # Matthew 15:18
#   And I will give you
#   the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
#   and whatever you bind on earth
#   will be bound in heaven,
#   and whatever you loose on earth
#   will be loosed in heaven.
# }

# # Matthew 15:19
# Then He commanded His disciples
# that they should tell no one
# that He was Jesus the Christ.

# # Matthew 15:20
# From that time
# Jesus began to show to His disciples
# that He must go to Jerusalem,
# and suffer many things
# from the elders and chief priests and scribes,
# and be killed,
# and be raised the third day.

# # Matthew 15:21
# Then Peter took Him aside
# and began to rebuke Him, saying,
# {
#   Far be it from You, Lord;
#   this shall not happen to You!
# }

# # Matthew 15:22
# But He turned and said to Peter,
# {
#   Get behind Me, Satan!

#   You are an offense to Me,
#   for you are not mindful of the things of God,
#   but the things of men.
# }

# # Matthew 15:23
# Then Jesus said to His disciples,
# {
#   If anyone desires to come after Me,
#   let him deny himself,
#   and take up his cross,
#   and follow Me.

#   # Matthew 15:24
#   For whoever desires to save his life
#     will lose it,
#   but whoever loses his life for My sake
#     will find it.

#   # Matthew 15:25
#   For what profit is it to a man
#   if he gains the whole world,
#   and loses his own soul?

#   Or what will a man give
#   in exchange for his soul?

#   # Matthew 15:26
#   For the Son of Man will come
#   in the glory of His Father
#   with His angels,
#   and then He will reward each
#   according to his works.

#   # Matthew 15:27
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   there are some standing here
#   who shall not taste death
#   till they see the Son of Man
#   coming in His kingdom.
# }

# # Matthew 16:1
# Now after six days
# Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother,
# led them up on a high mountain by themselves;
# # Matthew 16:2
# and He was transfigured before them.

# His face shone like the sun,
# and His clothes became as white as the light.

# # Matthew 16:3
# And behold,
# Moses and Elijah appeared to them,
# talking with Him.

# # Matthew 16:4
# Then Peter answered and said to Jesus,
# {
#   Lord, it is good for us to be here;
#   if You wish,
#   let us make here three tabernacles:
#     one for You,
#     one for Moses,
#     and one for Elijah.
# }

# # Matthew 16:5
# While he was still speaking,
# behold,
# a bright cloud overshadowed them;
# and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud,
# saying,
# {
#   This is My beloved Son,
#   in whom I am well pleased.

#   Hear Him!
# }

# # Matthew 16:6
# And when the disciples heard it,
# they fell on their faces
# and were greatly afraid.

# # Matthew 16:7
# But Jesus came and touched them and said,
# {
#   Arise, and do not be afraid.
# }

# # Matthew 16:8
# When they had lifted up their eyes,
# they saw no one but Jesus only.

# # Matthew 16:9
# Now as they came down from the mountain,
# Jesus commanded them, saying,
# {
#   Tell the vision to no one
#   until the Son of Man is risen from the dead.
# }

# # Matthew 16:10
# And His disciples asked Him, saying,
# {
#   Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
# }

# # Matthew 16:11
# Jesus answered and said to them,
# {
#   Indeed,
#   Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.

#   # Matthew 16:12
#   But I say to you that Elijah has come already,
#   and they did not know him
#   but did to him whatever they wished.

#   Likewise the Son of Man is also
#   about to suffer at their hands.
# }

# # Matthew 16:13
# Then the disciples understood
# that He spoke to them of John the Baptist.

# # Matthew 16:14
# And when they had come to the multitude,
# a man came to Him,
# kneeling down to Him and saying,
# {
#   # Matthew 16:15
#   Lord, have mercy on my son,
#   for he is an epileptic and suffers severely;
#   for he often falls into the fire
#   and often into the water.

#   # Matthew 16:16
#   So I brought him to Your disciples,
#   but they could not cure him.
# }

# # Matthew 16:17
# Then Jesus answered and said,
# {
#   O faithless and perverse generation,
#   how long shall I be with you?

#   How long shall I bear with you?

#   Bring him here to Me.
# }

# # Matthew 16:18
# And Jesus rebuked the demon,
# and it came out of him;
# and the child was cured from that very hour.

# # Matthew 16:19
# Then the disciples came to Jesus privately
# and said,
# {
#   Why could we not cast it out?
# }

# # Matthew 16:20
# So Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Because of your unbelief;
#   for assuredly, I say to you,
#   if you have faith as a mustard seed,
#   you will say to this mountain,
#   {
#     Move from here to there,
#   }
#   and it will move;
#   and nothing will be impossible for you.

#   # Matthew 16:21
#   However,
#   this kind does not go out
#   except by prayer and fasting.
# }

# # Matthew 16:22
# Now while they were staying in Galilee,
# Jesus said to them,
# {
#   The Son of Man is about to be betrayed
#   into the hands of men,
#   # Matthew 16:23
#   and they will kill Him,
#   and the third day He will be raised up.
# }

# And they were exceedingly sorrowful.

# # Matthew 16:24
# When they had come to Capernaum,
# those who received the temple tax
# came to Peter and said,
# {
#   Does your Teacher not pay the temple tax?
# }

# # Matthew 16:25
# He said, "Yes."

# And when he had come into the house,
# Jesus anticipated him, saying,
# {
#   What do you think, Simon?

#   From whom do the kings of the earth
#   take customs or taxes,
#   from their sons or from strangers?
# }

# # Matthew 16:26
# Peter said to Him,
# {
#   From strangers.
# }

# Jesus said to him,
# {
#   Then the sons are free.

#   # Matthew 16:27
#   Nevertheless,
#   lest we offend them,
#   go to the sea,
#   cast in a hook,
#   and take the fish that comes up first.

#   And when you have opened its mouth,
#   you will find a piece of money;
#   take that and give it to them for Me and you.
# }

# # Matthew 17:1
# At that time the disciples came to Jesus,
# saying,
# {
#   Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
# }

# # Matthew 17:2
# Then Jesus called a little child to Him,
# set him in the midst of them,
# # Matthew 17:3
# and said,
# {
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   unless you are converted
#   and become as little children,
#   you will by no means
#   enter the kingdom of heaven.

#   # Matthew 17:4
#   Therefore whoever humbles himself
#   as this little child
#   is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

#   # Matthew 17:5
#   Whoever receives one little child like this
#   in My name
#   receives Me.

#   # Matthew 17:6
#   But whoever causes one of these little ones
#   who believe in Me
#   to sin,
#   it would be better for him if a millstone
#   were hung around his neck,
#   and he were drowned in the depth of the sea.

#   # Matthew 17:7
#   Woe to the world because of offenses!

#   For offenses must come,
#   but woe to that man
#   by whom the offense comes!

#   # Matthew 17:8
#   If your hand or foot causes you to sin,
#   cut it off and cast it from you.

#   It is better for you
#   to enter into life lame or maimed,
#   rather than having two hands or two feet,
#   to be cast into the everlasting fire.

#   # Matthew 17:9
#   And if your eye causes you to sin,
#   pluck it out and cast it from you.

#   It is better for you to enter into life with one eye,
#   rather than having two eyes,
#   to be cast into hell fire.

#   # Matthew 17:10
#   Take heed that you do not despise
#   one of these little ones,
#   for I say to you that in heaven
#   their angels always see
#   the face of My Father who is in heaven.

#   # Matthew 17:11
#   For the Son of Man has come
#   to save that which was lost.

#   # Matthew 17:12
#   What do you think?

#   If a man has one hundred sheep,
#   and one of them goes astray,
#   does he not leave the ninety-nine
#   and go to the mountains
#   to seek the one that is straying?

#   # Matthew 17:13
#   And if he should find it,
#   assuredly, I say to you,
#   he rejoices more over that sheep
#   than over the 99 that did not go astray.

#   # Matthew 17:14
#   Even so it is not the will of your Father
#   who is in heaven
#   that one of these little ones should perish.

#   # Matthew 17:15
#   Moreover if your brother sins against you,
#   go and tell him his fault
#   between you and him alone.

#   If he hears you, you have gained your brother.

#   # Matthew 17:16
#   But if he will not hear,
#   take with you one or two more, that
#   {
#     by the mouth of two or three witnesses
#     every word may be established.
#   }

#   # Matthew 17:17
#   And if he refuses to hear them,
#   tell it to the church.

#   But if he refuses even to hear the church,
#   let him be to you
#   like a heathen and a tax collector.

#   # Matthew 17:18
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   whatever you bind on earth
#     will be bound in heaven,
#   and whatever you loose on earth
#     will be loosed in heaven.

#   # Matthew 17:19
#   Again I say to you
#   that if two of you agree on earth
#   concerning anything that they ask,
#   it will be done for them
#   by My Father in heaven.

#   # Matthew 17:20
#   For where two or three are gathered together
#   in My name,
#   I am there in the midst of them.
# }

# # Matthew 17:21
# Then Peter came to Him and said,
# {
#   Lord,
#   how often shall my brother sin against me,
#   and I forgive him?

#   Up to seven times?
# }

# # Matthew 17:22
# Jesus said to him,
# {
#   I do not say to you, up to seven times,
#   but up to seventy times seven.

#   # Matthew 17:23
#   Therefore
#   the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king
#   who wanted to settle accounts
#   with his servants.

#   # Matthew 17:24
#   And when he had begun to settle accounts,
#   one was brought to him
#   who owed him 10,000 talents.

#   # Matthew 17:25
#   But as he was not able to pay,
#   his master commanded that he be sold,
#   with his wife and children
#   and all that he had,
#   and that payment be made.

#   # Matthew 17:26
#   The servant therefore fell down before him,
#   saying,
#   {
#     Master, have patience with me,
#     and I will pay you all.
#   }

#   # Matthew 17:27
#   Then the master of that servant
#   was moved with compassion,
#   released him,
#   and forgave him the debt.

#   # Matthew 17:28
#   But that servant went out
#   and found one of his fellow servants
#   who owed him 100 denarii;
#   and he laid hands on him
#   and took him by the throat, saying,
#   {
#     Pay me what you owe!
#   }

#   # Matthew 17:29
#   So his fellow servant
#   fell down at his feet and begged him,
#   saying,
#   {
#     Have patience with me,
#     and I will pay you all.
#   }

#   # Matthew 17:30
#   And he would not,
#   but went and threw him into prison
#   till he should pay the debt.

#   # Matthew 17:31
#   So when his fellow servants
#   saw what had been done,
#   they were very grieved,
#   and came and told their master
#   all that had been done.

#   # Matthew 17:32
#   Then his master,
#   after he had called him,
#   said to him,
#   {
#     You wicked servant!

#     I forgave you all that debt
#     because you begged me.

#     # Matthew 17:33
#     Should you not also have had compassion
#     on your fellow servant,
#     just as I had pity on you?
#   }

#   # Matthew 17:34
#   And his master was angry,
#   and delivered him to the torturers
#   until he should pay all that was due to him.

#   # Matthew 17:35
#   So My heavenly Father also will do to you
#   if each of you,
#   from his heart,
#   does not forgive his brother his trespasses.
# }

# # Matthew 18:1
# Now it came to pass,
# when Jesus had finished these sayings,
# that He departed from Galilee
# and came to the region of Judea
# beyond the Jordan.

# # Matthew 18:2
# And great multitudes followed Him,
# and He healed them there.

# # Matthew 18:3
# The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him,
# and saying to Him,
# {
#   Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife
#   for just any reason?
# }

# # Matthew 18:4
# And He answered and said to them,
# {
#   Have you not read
#   that He who made them at the beginning
#   {
#     made them male and female,
#   }
#   # Matthew 18:5
#   and said,
#   {
#     For this reason
#     a man shall leave his father and mother
#     and be joined to his wife,
#     and the two shall become one flesh
#   }?

#   # Matthew 18:6
#   So then, they are no longer two but one flesh.

#   Therefore what God has joined together,
#   let not man separate.
# }

# # Matthew 18:7
# They said to Him,
# {
#   Why then did Moses
#   command to give a certificate of divorce,
#   and to put her away?
# }

# # Matthew 18:8
# He said to them,
# {
#   Moses,
#   because of the hardness of your hearts,
#   permitted you to divorce your wives,
#   but from the beginning it was not so.

#   # Matthew 18:9
#   And I say to you,
#   whoever divorces his wife,
#   except for sexual immorality,
#   and marries another,
#   commits adultery;
#   and whoever marries her who is divorced
#   commits adultery.
# }

# # Matthew 18:10
# His disciples said to Him,
# {
#   If such is the case of the man with his wife,
#   it is better not to marry.
# }

# # Matthew 18:11
# But He said to them,
# {
#   All cannot accept this saying,
#   but only those to whom it has been given:

#   # Matthew 18:12
#   For there are eunuchs
#   who were born thus from their mother's womb,
#   and there are eunuchs
#   who were made eunuchs by men,
#   and there are eunuchs
#   who have made themselves eunuchs
#   for the kingdom of heaven's sake.

#   He who is able to accept it,
#   let him accept it.
# }

# # Matthew 18:13
# Then little children were brought to Him
# that He might put His hands on them and pray,
# but the disciples rebuked them.

# # Matthew 18:14
# But Jesus said,
# {
#   Let the little children come to Me,
#   and do not forbid them;
#   for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
# }

# # Matthew 18:15
# And He laid His hands on them
# and departed from there.

# # Matthew 18:16
# Now behold, one came and said to Him,
# {
#   Good Teacher,
#   what good thing shall I do
#   that I may have eternal life?
# }

# # Matthew 18:17
# So He said to him,
# {
#   Why do you call Me good?

#   No one is good but One, that is, God.

#   But if you want to enter into life,
#   keep the commandments.
# }

# # Matthew 18:18
# He said to Him,
# {
#   Which ones?
# }

# Jesus said,
# {
#   {
#     You shall not murder,
#   }
#   {
#     You shall not commit adultery,
#   }
#   {
#     You shall not steal,
#   }
#   {
#     You shall not bear false witness,
#   }
#   {
#     # Matthew 18:19
#     Honor your father and your mother,
#   }
#   and,
#   {
#     You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 18:20
# The young man said to Him,
# {
#   All these things I have kept from my youth.

#   What do I still lack?
# }

# # Matthew 18:21
# Jesus said to him,
# {
#   If you want to be perfect,
#   go, sell what you have and give to the poor,
#   and you will have treasure in heaven;
#   and come, follow Me.
# }

# # Matthew 18:22
# But when the young man heard that saying,
# he went away sorrowful,
# for he had great possessions.

# # Matthew 18:23
# Then Jesus said to His disciples,
# {
#   Assuredly, I say to you
#   that it is hard for a rich man
#   to enter the kingdom of heaven.

#   # Matthew 18:24
#   And again I say to you,
#   it is easier for a camel
#     to go through the eye of a needle
#   than for a rich man
#     to enter the kingdom of God.
# }

# # Matthew 18:25
# When His disciples heard it,
# they were greatly astonished, saying,
# {
#   Who then can be saved?
# }

# # Matthew 18:26
# But Jesus looked at them and said to them,
# {
#   With men this is impossible,
#   but with God all things are possible.
# }

# # Matthew 18:27
# Then Peter answered and said to Him,
# {
#   See, we have left all and followed You.

#   Therefore what shall we have?
# }

# # Matthew 18:28
# So Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Assuredly I say to you,
#   that in the regeneration,
#   when the Son of Man
#   sits on the throne of His glory,
#   you who have followed Me
#   will also sit on twelve thrones,
#   judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

#   # Matthew 18:29
#   And everyone who has left houses
#   or brothers
#   or sisters
#   or father
#   or mother
#   or wife
#   or children
#   or lands,
#   for My name's sake,
#   shall receive a hundredfold,
#   and inherit eternal life.

#   # Matthew 18:30
#   But many who are first will be last,
#   and the last first.

#   # Matthew 19:1
#   For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner
#   who went out early in the morning
#   to hire laborers for his vineyard.

#   # Matthew 19:2
#   Now when he had agreed with the laborers
#   for a denarius a day,
#   he sent them into his vineyard.

#   # Matthew 19:3
#   And he went out about the third hour
#   and saw others
#   standing idle in the marketplace,
#   # Matthew 19:4
#   and said to them,
#   {
#     You also go into the vineyard,
#     and whatever is right I will give you.
#   }

#   So they went.

#   # Matthew 19:5
#   Again he went out
#   about the sixth and the ninth hour,
#   and did likewise.

#   # Matthew 19:6
#   And about the eleventh hour
#   he went out and found others standing idle,
#   and said to them,
#   {
#     Why have you been standing here
#     idle all day?
#   }

#   # Matthew 19:7
#   They said to him,
#   {
#     Because no one hired us.
#   }

#   He said to them,
#   {
#     You also go into the vineyard,
#     and whatever is right you will receive.
#   }

#   # Matthew 19:8
#   So when evening had come,
#   the owner of the vineyard said to his steward,
#   {
#     Call the laborers and give them their wages,
#     beginning with the last to the first.
#   }

#   # Matthew 19:9
#   And when those came
#   who were hired about the eleventh hour,
#   they each received a denarius.

#   # Matthew 19:10
#   But when the first came,
#   they supposed that they would receive more;
#   and they likewise received each a denarius.

#   # Matthew 19:11
#   And when they had received it,
#   they complained against the landowner,
#   # Matthew 19:12
#   saying,
#   {
#     These last men have worked only one hour,
#     and you made them equal to us
#     who have borne the burden
#     and the heat of the day.
#   }

#   # Matthew 19:13
#   But he answered one of them and said,
#   {
#     Friend, I am doing you no wrong.

#     Did you not agree with me for a denarius?

#     # Matthew 19:14
#     Take what is yours and go your way.

#     I wish to give to this last man
#     the same as to you.

#     # Matthew 19:15
#     Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish
#     with my own things?

#     Or is your eye evil because I am good?
#   }

#   # Matthew 19:16
#   So the last will be first, and the first last.

#   For many are called, but few chosen.
# }

# # Matthew 19:17
# Now Jesus, going up to Jerusalem,
# took the twelve disciples aside on the road
# and said to them,
# {
#   # Matthew 19:18
#   Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem,
#   and the Son of Man will be betrayed
#   to the chief priests and to the scribes;
#   and they will condemn Him to death,
#   # Matthew 19:19
#   and deliver Him to the Gentiles
#   to mock and to scourge and to crucify.

#   And the third day He will rise again.
# }

# # Matthew 19:20
# Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Him
# with her sons,
# kneeling down and asking something from Him.

# # Matthew 19:21
# And He said to her,
# {
#   What do you wish?
# }

# She said to Him,
# {
#   Grant that these two sons of mine may sit,
#   one on Your right hand
#   and the other on the left,
#   in Your kingdom.
# }

# # Matthew 19:22
# But Jesus answered and said,
# {
#   You do not know what you ask.

#   Are you able to drink the cup
#     that I am about to drink,
#   and be baptized with the baptism
#     that I am baptized with?
# }

# They said to Him,
# {
#   We are able.
# }

# # Matthew 19:23
# So He said to them,
# {
#   You will indeed drink My cup,
#   and be baptized with the baptism
#   that I am baptized with;
#   but to sit on My right hand and on My left
#   is not Mine to give,
#   but it is for those for whom it is prepared
#   by My Father.
# }

# # Matthew 19:24
# And when the ten heard it,
# they were greatly displeased
# with the two brothers.

# # Matthew 19:25
# But Jesus called them to Himself and said,
# {
#   You know that the rulers of the Gentiles
#   lord it over them,
#   and those who are great
#   exercise authority over them.

#   # Matthew 19:26
#   Yet it shall not be so among you;
#   but whoever desires to become great among you,
#   let him be your servant.

#   # Matthew 19:27
#   And whoever desires to be first among you,
#   let him be your slave --
#   # Matthew 19:28
#   just as the Son of Man
#   did not come to be served,
#   but to serve,
#   and to give His life a ransom for many.
# }

# # Matthew 19:29
# Now as they went out of Jericho,
# a great multitude followed Him.

# # Matthew 19:30
# And behold, two blind men sitting by the road,
# when they heard that Jesus was passing by,
# cried out, saying,
# {
#   Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!
# }

# # Matthew 19:31
# Then the multitude warned them
# that they should be quiet;
# but they cried out all the more, saying,
# {
#   Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!
# }

# # Matthew 19:32
# So Jesus stood still and called them, and said,
# {
#   What do you want Me to do for you?
# }

# # Matthew 19:33
# They said to Him,
# {
#   Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
# }

# # Matthew 19:34
# So Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes.

# And immediately their eyes received sight,
# and they followed Him.

# # Matthew 20:1
# Now when they drew near Jerusalem,
# and came to Bethphage,
# at the Mount of Olives,
# then Jesus sent two disciples,
# # Matthew 20:2
# saying to them,
# {
#   Go into the village opposite you,
#   and immediately you will find a donkey tied,
#   and a colt with her.

#   Loose them and bring them to Me.

#   # Matthew 20:3
#   And if anyone says anything to you,
#   you shall say,
#   {
#     The Lord has need of them,
#   }
#   and immediately he will send them.
# }

# # Matthew 20:4
# All this was done that it might be fulfilled
# which was spoken by the prophet, saying:
# {
#   # Matthew 20:5
#   Tell the daughter of Zion,
#   {
#     Behold, your King is coming to you,
#     Lowly, and sitting on a donkey,
#     A colt, the foal of a donkey.
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 20:6
# So the disciples went
# and did as Jesus commanded them.

# # Matthew 20:7
# They brought the donkey and the colt,
# laid their clothes on them,
# and set Him on them.

# # Matthew 20:8
# And a very great multitude
# spread their clothes on the road;
# others cut down branches from the trees
# and spread them on the road.

# # Matthew 20:9
# Then the multitudes who went before
# and those who followed cried out, saying:
# {
#   Hosanna to the Son of David!

#   {
#     Blessed is He
#     who comes in the name of the Lord!
#   }

#   Hosanna in the highest!
# }

# # Matthew 20:10
# And when He had come into Jerusalem,
# all the city was moved, saying,
# {
#   Who is this?
# }

# # Matthew 20:11
# So the multitudes said,
# {
#   This is Jesus,
#   the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.
# }

# # Matthew 20:12
# Then Jesus went into the temple of God
# and drove out all those
# who bought and sold in the temple,
# and overturned the tables of the money changers
# and the seats of those who sold doves.

# # Matthew 20:13
# And He said to them,
# {
#   It is written,
#   {
#     My house shall be called a house of prayer,
#   }
#   but you have made it a
#   {
#     den of thieves.
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 20:14
# Then the blind and the lame came to Him
# in the temple,
# and He healed them.

# # Matthew 20:15
# But when the chief priests and scribes
# saw the wonderful things that He did,
# and the children crying out in the temple
# and saying,
# {
#   Hosanna to the Son of David!
# }
# they were indignant
# # Matthew 20:16
# and said to Him,
# {
#   Do You hear what these are saying?
# }

# And Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Yes.

#   Have you never read,
#   {
#     Out of the mouth of babes
#       and nursing infants
#     You have perfected praise
#   }?
# }

# # Matthew 20:17
# Then He left them and went out of the city
# to Bethany,
# and He lodged there.

# # Matthew 20:18
# Now in the morning,
# as He returned to the city,
# He was hungry.

# # Matthew 20:19
# And seeing a fig tree by the road,
# He came to it
# and found nothing on it but leaves,
# and said to it,
# {
#   Let no fruit grow on you ever again.
# }

# Immediately the fig tree withered away.

# # Matthew 20:20
# And when the disciples saw it, they marveled,
# saying,
# {
#   How did the fig tree wither away so soon?
# }

# # Matthew 20:21
# So Jesus answered and said to them,
# {
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   if you have faith and do not doubt,
#   you will not only do
#   what was done to the fig tree,
#   but also if you say to this mountain,
#   {
#     Be removed and be cast into the sea,
#   }
#   it will be done.

#   # Matthew 20:22
#   And whatever things you ask in prayer,
#   believing,
#   you will receive.
# }

# # Matthew 20:23
# Now when He came into the temple,
# the chief priests and the elders of the people
# confronted Him
# as He was teaching,
# and said,
# {
#   By what authority are You doing these things?

#   And who gave You this authority?
# }

# # Matthew 20:24
# But Jesus answered and said to them,
# {
#   I also will ask you one thing,
#   which if you tell Me,
#   I likewise will tell you
#   by what authority I do these things:

#   # Matthew 20:25
#   The baptism of John -- where was it from?

#   From heaven or from men?
# }

# And they reasoned among themselves, saying,
# {
#   If we say,
#   {
#     From heaven,
#   }
#   He will say to us,
#   {
#     Why then did you not believe him?
#   }

#   # Matthew 20:26
#   But if we say,
#   {
#     From men,
#   }
#   we fear the multitude,
#   for all count John as a prophet.
# }

# # Matthew 20:27
# So they answered Jesus and said,
# {
#   We do not know.
# }

# And He said to them,
# {
#   Neither will I tell you
#   by what authority I do these things.

#   # Matthew 20:28
#   But what do you think?

#   A man had two sons,
#   and he came to the first and said,
#   {
#     Son, go, work today in my vineyard.
#   }

#   # Matthew 20:29
#   He answered and said,
#   {
#     I will not,
#   }
#   but afterward he regretted it and went.

#   # Matthew 20:30
#   Then he came to the second and said likewise.

#   And he answered and said,
#   {
#     I go, sir,
#   }
#   but he did not go.

#   # Matthew 20:31
#   Which of the two did the will of his father?
# }

# They said to Him,
# {
#   The first.
# }

# Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Assuredly, I say to you
#   that tax collectors and harlots
#   enter the kingdom of God before you.

#   # Matthew 20:32
#   For John came to you
#   in the way of righteousness,
#   and you did not believe him;
#   but tax collectors and harlots believed him;
#   and when you saw it,
#   you did not afterward relent and believe him.

#   # Matthew 20:33
#   Hear another parable:

#   There was a certain landowner
#   who planted a vineyard
#   and set a hedge around it,
#   dug a winepress in it
#   and built a tower.

#   And he leased it to vinedressers
#   and went into a far country.

#   # Matthew 20:34
#   Now when vintage-time drew near,
#   he sent his servants to the vinedressers,
#   that they might receive its fruit.

#   # Matthew 20:35
#   And the vinedressers took his servants,
#   beat one,
#   killed one,
#   and stoned another.

#   # Matthew 20:36
#   Again he sent other servants,
#   more than the first,
#   and they did likewise to them.

#   # Matthew 20:37
#   Then last of all he sent his son to them,
#   saying,
#   {
#     They will respect my son.
#   }

#   # Matthew 20:38
#   But when the vinedressers saw the son,
#   they said among themselves,
#   {
#     This is the heir.

#     Come,
#     let us kill him and seize his inheritance.
#   }

#   # Matthew 20:39
#   So they took him
#   and cast him out of the vineyard
#   and killed him.

#   # Matthew 20:40
#   Therefore,
#   when the owner of the vineyard comes,
#   what will he do to those vinedressers?
# }

# # Matthew 20:41
# They said to Him,
# {
#   He will destroy those wicked men miserably,
#   and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers
#   who will render to him
#   the fruits in their seasons.
# }

# # Matthew 20:42
# Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Have you never read in the Scriptures:
#   {
#     The stone which the builders rejected
#     Has become the chief cornerstone.

#     This was the Lord's doing,
#     And it is marvelous in our eyes
#   }?

#   # Matthew 20:43
#   Therefore I say to you,
#   the kingdom of God will be taken from you
#   and given to a nation
#   bearing the fruits of it.

#   # Matthew 20:44
#   And whoever falls on this stone
#   will be broken;
#   but on whomever it falls,
#   it will grind him to powder.
# }

# # Matthew 20:45
# Now when the chief priests and Pharisees
# heard His parables,
# they perceived that He was speaking of them.

# # Matthew 20:46
# But when they sought to lay hands on Him,
# they feared the multitudes,
# because they took Him for a prophet.

# # Matthew 21:1
# And Jesus answered
# and spoke to them again by parables
# and said:
# {
#   # Matthew 21:2
#   The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king
#   who arranged a marriage for his son,
#   # Matthew 21:3
#   and sent out his servants
#   to call those who were invited to the wedding;
#   and they were not willing to come.

#   # Matthew 21:4
#   Again, he sent out other servants,
#   saying,
#   {
#     Tell those who are invited,
#     {
#       See, I have prepared my dinner;
#       my oxen and fatted cattle are killed,
#       and all things are ready.

#       Come to the wedding.
#     }
#   }

#   # Matthew 21:5
#   But they made light of it and went their ways,
#   one to his own farm,
#   another to his business.

#   # Matthew 21:6
#   And the rest seized his servants,
#   treated them spitefully,
#   and killed them.

#   # Matthew 21:7
#   But when the king heard about it,
#   he was furious.

#   And he sent out his armies,
#   destroyed those murderers,
#   and burned up their city.

#   # Matthew 21:8
#   Then he said to his servants,
#   {
#     The wedding is ready,
#     but those who were invited were not worthy.

#     # Matthew 21:9
#     Therefore go into the highways,
#     and as many as you find,
#     invite to the wedding.
#   }

#   # Matthew 21:10
#   So those servants went out into the highways
#   and gathered together all whom they found,
#   both bad and good.

#   And the wedding hall was filled with guests.

#   # Matthew 21:11
#   But when the king came in to see the guests,
#   he saw a man there
#   who did not have on a wedding garment.

#   # Matthew 21:12
#   So he said to him,
#   {
#     Friend,
#     how did you come in here
#     without a wedding garment?
#   }

#   And he was speechless.

#   # Matthew 21:13
#   Then the king said to the servants,
#   {
#     Bind him hand and foot,
#     take him away,
#     and cast him into outer darkness;
#     there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
#   }

#   # Matthew 21:14
#   For many are called, but few are chosen.
# }

# # Matthew 21:15
# Then the Pharisees went and plotted
# how they might entangle Him in His talk.

# # Matthew 21:16
# And they sent to Him their disciples
# with the Herodians, saying,
# {
#   Teacher, we know that You are true,
#   and teach the way of God in truth;
#   nor do You care about anyone,
#   for You do not regard the person of men.

#   # Matthew 21:17
#   Tell us, therefore, what do You think?

#   Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?
# }

# # Matthew 21:18
# But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said,
# {
#   Why do you test Me, you hypocrites?

#   # Matthew 21:19
#   Show Me the tax money.
# }

# So they brought Him a denarius.

# # Matthew 21:20
# And He said to them,
# {
#   Whose image and inscription is this?
# }

# # Matthew 21:21
# They said to Him,
# {
#   Caesar's.
# }

# And He said to them,
# {
#   Render therefore to Caesar
#     the things that are Caesar's,
#   and to God
#     the things that are God's.
# }

# # Matthew 21:22
# When they had heard these words, they marveled,
# and left Him and went their way.

# # Matthew 21:23
# The same day the Sadducees,
# who say there is no resurrection,
# came to Him and asked Him,
# # Matthew 21:24
# saying:
# {
#   Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies,
#   having no children,
#   his brother shall marry his wife
#   and raise up offspring for his brother.

#   # Matthew 21:25
#   Now there were with us seven brothers.

#   The first died after he had married,
#   and having no offspring,
#   left his wife to his brother.

#   # Matthew 21:26
#   Likewise the second also,
#   and the third,
#   even to the seventh.

#   # Matthew 21:27
#   Last of all the woman died also.

#   # Matthew 21:28
#   Therefore, in the resurrection,
#   whose wife of the seven will she be?

#   For they all had her.
# }

# # Matthew 21:29
# Jesus answered and said to them,
# {
#   You are mistaken,
#   not knowing the Scriptures
#   nor the power of God.

#   # Matthew 21:30
#   For in the resurrection
#   they neither marry nor are given in marriage,
#   but are like angels of God in heaven.

#   # Matthew 21:31
#   But concerning the resurrection of the dead,
#   have you not read
#   what was spoken to you by God,
#   saying,
#   {
#     # Matthew 21:32
#     I am the God of Abraham,
#     the God of Isaac,
#     and the God of Jacob
#   }?

#   God is not the God of the dead,
#   but of the living.
# }

# # Matthew 21:33
# And when the multitudes heard this,
# they were astonished at His teaching.

# # Matthew 21:34
# But when the Pharisees
# heard that He had silenced the Sadducees,
# they gathered together.

# # Matthew 21:35
# Then one of them, a lawyer,
# asked Him a question,
# testing Him, and saying,
# {
#   # Matthew 21:36
#   Teacher,
#   which is the great commandment in the law?
# }

# # Matthew 21:37
# Jesus said to him,
# {
#   {
#     You shall love the Lord your God
#     with all your heart,
#     with all your soul,
#     and with all your mind.
#   }

#   # Matthew 21:38
#   This is the first and great commandment.

#   # Matthew 21:39
#   And the second is like it:
#   {
#     You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
#   }

#   # Matthew 21:40
#   On these two commandments
#   hang all the Law and the Prophets.
# }

# # Matthew 21:41
# While the Pharisees were gathered together,
# Jesus asked them,
# # Matthew 21:42
# saying,
# {
#   What do you think about the Christ?

#   Whose Son is He?
# }

# They said to Him,
# {
#   The Son of David.
# }

# # Matthew 21:43
# He said to them,
# {
#   How then does David in the Spirit
#   call Him
#   {
#     Lord,
#   }
#   saying:
#   {
#     # Matthew 21:44
#     The Lord said to my Lord,
#     {
#       Sit at My right hand,
#       Till I make Your enemies Your footstool
#     }
#   }?

#   {
#     # Matthew 21:45
#     If David then calls Him
#     {
#       Lord,
#     }
#     how is He his Son?
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 21:46
# And no one was able to answer Him a word,
# nor from that day on
# did anyone dare question Him anymore.

# # Matthew 22:1
# Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes
# and to His disciples,
# # Matthew 22:2
# saying:
# {
#   The scribes and the Pharisees
#   sit in Moses' seat.

#   # Matthew 22:3
#   Therefore whatever they tell you to observe,
#   that observe and do,
#   but do not do according to their works;
#   for they say, and do not do.

#   # Matthew 22:4
#   For they bind heavy burdens,
#   hard to bear,
#   and lay them on men's shoulders;
#   but they themselves
#   will not move them
#   with one of their fingers.

#   # Matthew 22:5
#   But all their works they do to be seen by men.

#   They make their phylacteries broad
#   and enlarge the borders of their garments.

#   # Matthew 22:6
#   They love the best places at feasts,
#   the best seats in the synagogues,
#   # Matthew 22:7
#   greetings in the marketplaces,
#   and to be called by men,
#   {
#     Rabbi, Rabbi.
#   }

#   # Matthew 22:8
#   But you, do not be called "Rabbi";
#   for One is your Teacher, the Christ,
#   and you are all brethren.

#   # Matthew 22:9
#   Do not call anyone on earth your father;
#   for One is your Father,
#   He who is in heaven.

#   # Matthew 22:10
#   And do not be called teachers;
#   for One is your Teacher, the Christ.

#   # Matthew 22:11
#   But he who is greatest among you
#   shall be your servant.

#   # Matthew 22:12
#   And whoever exalts himself will be humbled,
#   and he who humbles himself will be exalted.

#   # Matthew 22:13
#   But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
#   hypocrites!

#   For you shut up the kingdom of heaven
#   against men;
#   for you neither go in yourselves,
#   nor do you allow those who are entering
#   to go in.

#   # Matthew 22:14
#   Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
#   hypocrites!

#   For you devour widows' houses,
#   and for a pretense make long prayers.

#   Therefore
#   you will receive greater condemnation.

#   # Matthew 22:15
#   Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
#   hypocrites!

#   For you travel land and sea
#   to win one proselyte,
#   and when he is won,
#   you make him twice as much a son of hell
#   as yourselves.

#   # Matthew 22:16
#   Woe to you, blind guides, who say,
#   {
#     Whoever swears by the temple,
#     it is nothing;
#     but whoever swears
#     by the gold of the temple,
#     he is obliged to perform it.
#   }

#   # Matthew 22:17
#   Fools and blind!

#   For which is greater,
#   the gold
#   or the temple that sanctifies the gold?

#   # Matthew 22:18
#   And,
#   {
#     Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing;
#     but whoever swears
#     by the gift that is on it,
#     he is obliged to perform it.
#   }

#   # Matthew 22:19
#   Fools and blind!

#   For which is greater,
#   the gift
#   or the altar that sanctifies the gift?

#   # Matthew 22:20
#   Therefore he who swears by the altar,
#   swears by it
#   and by all things on it.

#   # Matthew 22:21
#   He who swears by the temple,
#   swears by it
#   and by Him who dwells in it.

#   # Matthew 22:22
#   And he who swears by heaven,
#   swears by the throne of God
#   and by Him who sits on it.

#   # Matthew 22:23
#   Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
#   hypocrites!

#   For you pay tithe
#   of mint and anise and cummin,
#   and have neglected the weightier matters
#   of the law:
#   justice and mercy and faith.

#   These you ought to have done,
#   without leaving the others undone.

#   # Matthew 22:24
#   Blind guides,
#   who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!

#   # Matthew 22:25
#   Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
#   hypocrites!

#   For you cleanse the outside
#   of the cup and dish,
#   but inside they are full of extortion
#   and self-indulgence.

#   # Matthew 22:26
#   Blind Pharisee,
#   first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish,
#   that the outside of them may be clean also.

#   # Matthew 22:27
#   Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
#   hypocrites!

#   For you are like whitewashed tombs
#   which indeed appear beautiful outwardly,
#   but inside are full of dead men's bones
#   and all uncleanness.

#   # Matthew 22:28
#   Even so you also
#   outwardly appear righteous to men,
#   but inside
#   you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

#   # Matthew 22:29
#   Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
#   hypocrites!

#   Because you build the tombs of the prophets
#   and adorn the monuments of the righteous,
#   # Matthew 22:30
#   and say,
#   {
#     If we had lived in the days of our fathers,
#     we would not have been partakers with them
#     in the blood of the prophets.
#   }

#   # Matthew 22:31
#   Therefore
#   you are witnesses against yourselves
#   that you are sons of those
#   who murdered the prophets.

#   # Matthew 22:32
#   Fill up, then,
#   the measure of your fathers' guilt.

#   # Matthew 22:33
#   Serpents, brood of vipers!

#   How can you escape the condemnation of hell?

#   # Matthew 22:34
#   Therefore, indeed,
#   I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes:
#   some of them you will kill and crucify,
#   and some of them you will scourge
#   in your synagogues
#   and persecute from city to city,
#   # Matthew 22:35
#   that on you may come all the righteous blood
#   shed on the earth,
#   from the blood of righteous Abel
#   to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah,
#   whom you murdered
#   between the temple and the altar.

#   # Matthew 22:36
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   all these things will come
#   upon this generation.

#   # Matthew 22:37
#   O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
#   the one who kills the prophets
#   and stones those who are sent to her!

#   How often I wanted
#   to gather your children together,
#   as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings,
#   but you were not willing!

#   # Matthew 22:38
#   See! Your house is left to you desolate
#   # Matthew 22:39
#   for I say to you,
#   you shall see Me no more till you say,
#   {
#     Blessed is He
#     who comes in the name of the Lord!
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 23:1
# Then Jesus went out
# and departed from the temple,
# and His disciples came up
# to show Him the buildings of the temple.

# # Matthew 23:2
# And Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Do you not see all these things?

#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   not one stone shall be left here upon another,
#   that shall not be thrown down.
# }

# # Matthew 23:3
# Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives,
# the disciples came to Him privately,
# saying,
# {
#   Tell us, when will these things be?

#   And what will be the sign of Your coming,
#   and of the end of the age?
# }

# # Matthew 23:4
# And Jesus answered and said to them:
# {
#   Take heed that no one deceives you.

#   # Matthew 23:5
#   For many will come in My name, saying,
#   {
#     I am the Christ,
#   }
#   and will deceive many.

#   # Matthew 23:6
#   And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars.

#   See that you are not troubled;
#   for all these things must come to pass,
#   but the end is not yet.

#   # Matthew 23:7
#   For nation will rise against nation,
#   and kingdom against kingdom.

#   And there will be famines,
#   pestilences,
#   and earthquakes
#   in various places.

#   # Matthew 23:8
#   All these are the beginning of sorrows.

#   # Matthew 23:9
#   Then they will deliver you up to tribulation
#   and kill you,
#   and you will be hated by all nations
#   for My name's sake.

#   # Matthew 23:10
#   And then many will be offended,
#   will betray one another,
#   and will hate one another.

#   # Matthew 23:11
#   Then many false prophets
#   will rise up and deceive many.

#   # Matthew 23:12
#   And because lawlessness will abound,
#   the love of many will grow cold.

#   # Matthew 23:13
#   But he who endures to the end shall be saved.

#   # Matthew 23:14
#   And this gospel of the kingdom
#   will be preached in all the world
#   as a witness to all the nations,
#   and then the end will come.

#   # Matthew 23:15
#   Therefore
#   when you see the "abomination of desolation,"
#   spoken of by Daniel the prophet,
#   standing in the holy place
# }
# (whoever reads, let him understand),
# {
#   # Matthew 23:16
#   then let those who are in Judea
#   flee to the mountains.

#   # Matthew 23:17
#   Let him who is on the housetop
#   not go down to take anything out of his house.

#   # Matthew 23:18
#   And let him who is in the field
#   not go back to get his clothes.

#   # Matthew 23:19
#   But woe to those who are pregnant
#   and to those who are nursing babies
#   in those days!

#   # Matthew 23:20
#   And pray that your flight
#   may not be in winter or on the Sabbath.

#   # Matthew 23:21
#   For then there will be great tribulation,
#   such as has not been
#   since the beginning of the world
#   until this time,
#   no, nor ever shall be.

#   # Matthew 23:22
#   And unless those days were shortened,
#   no flesh would be saved;
#   but for the elect's sake
#   those days will be shortened.

#   # Matthew 23:23
#   Then if anyone says to you,
#   {
#     Look, here is the Christ!
#   }
#   or
#   {
#     There!
#   }
#   do not believe it.

#   # Matthew 23:24
#   For false christs and false prophets will rise
#   and show great signs and wonders
#   to deceive, if possible, even the elect.

#   # Matthew 23:25
#   See, I have told you beforehand.

#   # Matthew 23:26
#   Therefore if they say to you,
#   {
#     Look, He is in the desert!
#   }
#   do not go out;
#   or
#   {
#     Look, He is in the inner rooms!
#   }
#   do not believe it.

#   # Matthew 23:27
#   For as the lightning comes from the east
#   and flashes to the west,
#   so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.

#   # Matthew 23:28
#   For wherever the carcass is,
#   there the eagles will be gathered together.

#   # Matthew 23:29
#   Immediately after
#   the tribulation of those days
#   the sun will be darkened,
#   and the moon will not give its light;
#   the stars will fall from heaven,
#   and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

#   # Matthew 23:30
#   Then the sign of the Son of Man
#   will appear in heaven,
#   and then all the tribes of the earth
#   will mourn,
#   and they will see the Son of Man
#   coming on the clouds of heaven
#   with power and great glory.

#   # Matthew 23:31
#   And He will send His angels
#   with a great sound of a trumpet,
#   and they will gather together His elect
#   from the four winds,
#   from one end of heaven to the other.

#   # Matthew 23:32
#   Now learn this parable from the fig tree:
#   When its branch has already become tender
#   and puts forth leaves,
#   you know that summer is near.

#   # Matthew 23:33
#   So you also, when you see all these things,
#   know that it is near -- at the doors!

#   # Matthew 23:34
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   this generation will by no means pass away
#   till all these things take place.

#   # Matthew 23:35
#   Heaven and earth will pass away,
#   but My words will by no means pass away.

#   # Matthew 23:36
#   But of that day and hour no one knows,
#   not even the angels of heaven,
#   but My Father only.

#   # Matthew 23:37
#   But as the days of Noah were,
#   so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.

#   # Matthew 23:38
#   For as in the days before the flood,
#   they were eating and drinking,
#   marrying and giving in marriage,
#   until the day that Noah entered the ark,
#   # Matthew 23:39
#   and did not know until the flood came
#   and took them all away,
#   so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.

#   # Matthew 23:40
#   Then two men will be in the field:
#   one will be taken and the other left.

#   # Matthew 23:41
#   Two women will be grinding at the mill:
#   one will be taken and the other left.

#   # Matthew 23:42
#   Watch therefore,
#   for you do not know
#   what hour your Lord is coming.

#   # Matthew 23:43
#   But know this,
#   that if the master of the house had known
#   what hour the thief would come,
#   he would have watched
#   and not allowed his house to be broken into.

#   # Matthew 23:44
#   Therefore you also be ready,
#   for the Son of Man is coming
#   at an hour you do not expect.

#   # Matthew 23:45
#   Who then is a faithful and wise servant,
#   whom his master made ruler over his household,
#   to give them food in due season?

#   # Matthew 23:46
#   Blessed is that servant whom his master,
#   when he comes, will find so doing.

#   # Matthew 23:47
#   Assuredly, I say to you
#   that he will make him ruler
#   over all his goods.

#   # Matthew 23:48
#   But if that evil servant says in his heart,
#   {
#     My master is delaying his coming,
#   }
#   # Matthew 23:49
#   and begins to beat his fellow servants,
#   and to eat and drink with the drunkards,
#   # Matthew 23:50
#   the master of that servant will come on a day
#   when he is not looking for him
#   and at an hour that he is not aware of,
#   # Matthew 23:51
#   and will cut him in two
#   and appoint him his portion
#   with the hypocrites.

#   There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

#   # Matthew 24:1
#   Then the kingdom of heaven
#   shall be likened to ten virgins
#   who took their lamps
#   and went out to meet the bridegroom.

#   # Matthew 24:2
#   Now five of them were wise,
#   and five were foolish.

#   # Matthew 24:3
#   Those who were foolish took their lamps
#   and took no oil with them,
#   # Matthew 24:4
#   but the wise took oil in their vessels
#   with their lamps.

#   # Matthew 24:5
#   But while the bridegroom was delayed,
#   they all slumbered and slept.

#   # Matthew 24:6
#   And at midnight a cry was heard:
#   {
#     Behold, the bridegroom is coming;
#     go out to meet him!
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:7
#   Then all those virgins arose
#   and trimmed their lamps.

#   # Matthew 24:8
#   And the foolish said to the wise,
#   {
#     Give us some of your oil,
#     for our lamps are going out.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:9
#   But the wise answered, saying,
#   {
#     No, lest there should not be enough
#     for us and you;
#     but go rather to those who sell,
#     and buy for yourselves.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:10
#   And while they went to buy,
#   the bridegroom came,
#   and those who were ready
#   went in with him to the wedding;
#   and the door was shut.

#   # Matthew 24:11
#   Afterward the other virgins came also,
#   saying,
#   {
#     Lord, Lord, open to us!
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:12
#   But he answered and said,
#   {
#     Assuredly, I say to you,
#     I do not know you.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:13
#   Watch therefore,
#   for you know neither the day nor the hour
#   in which the Son of Man is coming.

#   # Matthew 24:14
#   For the kingdom of heaven
#   is like a man traveling to a far country,
#   who called his own servants
#   and delivered his goods to them.

#   # Matthew 24:15
#   And to one he gave five talents,
#   to another two,
#   and to another one,
#   to each according to his own ability;
#   and immediately he went on a journey.

#   # Matthew 24:16
#   Then he who had received the five talents
#   went and traded with them,
#   and made another five talents.

#   # Matthew 24:17
#   And likewise he who had received two
#   gained two more also.

#   # Matthew 24:18
#   But he who had received one
#   went and dug in the ground,
#   and hid his lord's money.

#   # Matthew 24:19
#   After a long time
#   the lord of those servants came
#   and settled accounts with them.

#   # Matthew 24:20
#   So he who had received five talents
#   came and brought five other talents, saying,
#   {
#     Lord, you delivered to me five talents;
#     look, I have gained five more talents
#     besides them.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:21
#   His lord said to him,
#   {
#     Well done, good and faithful servant;
#     you were faithful over a few things,
#     I will make you ruler over many things.

#     Enter into the joy of your lord.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:22
#   He also who had received two talents
#   came and said,
#   {
#     Lord, you delivered to me two talents;
#     look, I have gained two more talents
#     besides them.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:23
#   His lord said to him,
#   {
#     Well done, good and faithful servant;
#     you have been faithful over a few things,
#     I will make you ruler over many things.

#     Enter into the joy of your lord.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:24
#   Then he who had received the one talent
#   came and said,
#   {
#     Lord, I knew you to be a hard man,
#     reaping where you have not sown,
#     and gathering
#     where you have not scattered seed.

#     # Matthew 24:25
#     And I was afraid,
#     and went and hid your talent in the ground.

#     Look, there you have what is yours.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:26
#   But his lord answered and said to him,
#   {
#     You wicked and lazy servant,
#     you knew that I reap where I have not sown,
#     and gather where I have not scattered seed.

#     # Matthew 24:27
#     So you ought to have
#     deposited my money with the bankers,
#     and at my coming
#     I would have received back
#     my own with interest.

#     # Matthew 24:28
#     Therefore take the talent from him,
#     and give it to him who has ten talents.

#     # Matthew 24:29
#     For to everyone who has,
#     more will be given,
#     and he will have abundance;
#     but from him who does not have,
#     even what he has will be taken away.

#     # Matthew 24:30
#     And cast the unprofitable servant
#     into the outer darkness.

#     There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:31
#   When the Son of Man comes in His glory,
#   and all the holy angels with Him,
#   then He will sit on the throne of His glory.

#   # Matthew 24:32
#   All the nations will be gathered before Him,
#   and He will separate them one from another,
#   as a shepherd divides his sheep
#   from the goats.

#   # Matthew 24:33
#   And He will set the sheep on His right hand,
#   but the goats on the left.

#   # Matthew 24:34
#   Then the King will say
#   to those on His right hand,
#   {
#     Come, you blessed of My Father,
#     inherit the kingdom prepared for you
#     from the foundation of the world:
#     # Matthew 24:35
#     for I was hungry and you gave Me food;
#     I was thirsty and you gave Me drink;
#     I was a stranger and you took Me in;

#     # Matthew 24:36
#     I was naked and you clothed Me;
#     I was sick and you visited Me;
#     I was in prison and you came to Me.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:37
#   Then the righteous will answer Him, saying,
#   {
#     Lord,
#     when did we see You hungry and feed You,
#     or thirsty and give You drink?

#     # Matthew 24:38
#     When did we see You a stranger
#     and take You in,
#     or naked and clothe You?

#     # Matthew 24:39
#     Or when did we see You sick, or in prison,
#     and come to You?
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:40
#   And the King will answer and say to them,
#   {
#     Assuredly, I say to you,
#     inasmuch as you did it
#     to one of the least of these My brethren,
#     you did it to Me.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:41
#   Then He will also say
#   to those on the left hand,
#   {
#     Depart from Me, you cursed,
#     into the everlasting fire
#     prepared for the devil and his angels:
#       # Matthew 24:42
#       for I was hungry
#         and you gave Me no food;
#       I was thirsty
#         and you gave Me no drink;
#       # Matthew 24:43
#       I was a stranger
#         and you did not take Me in,
#       naked
#         and you did not clothe Me,
#       sick and in prison
#         and you did not visit Me.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:44
#   Then they also will answer Him, saying,
#   {
#     Lord, when did we see You hungry
#     or thirsty
#     or a stranger
#     or naked
#     or sick
#     or in prison,
#     and did not minister to You?
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:45
#   Then He will answer them, saying,
#   {
#     Assuredly, I say to you,
#     inasmuch as you did not do it
#     to one of the least of these,
#     you did not do it to Me.
#   }

#   # Matthew 24:46
#   And these will go away
#   into everlasting punishment,
#   but the righteous into eternal life.
# }

# # Matthew 25:1
# Now it came to pass,
# when Jesus had finished all these sayings,
# that He said to His disciples,
# {
#   # Matthew 25:2
#   You know that after two days is the Passover,
#   and the Son of Man
#   will be delivered up to be crucified.
# }

# # Matthew 25:3
# Then the chief priests, the scribes,
# and the elders of the people
# assembled at the palace of the high priest,
# who was called Caiaphas,
# # Matthew 25:4
# and plotted to take Jesus by trickery
# and kill Him.

# # Matthew 25:5
# But they said,
# {
#   Not during the feast,
#   lest there be an uproar among the people.
# }

# # Matthew 25:6
# And when Jesus was in Bethany
# at the house of Simon the leper,
# # Matthew 25:7
# a woman came to Him
# having an alabaster flask
# of very costly fragrant oil,
# and she poured it on His head
# as He sat at the table.

# # Matthew 25:8
# But when His disciples saw it,
# they were indignant, saying,
# {
#   Why this waste?

#   # Matthew 25:9
#   For this fragrant oil
#   might have been sold for much
#   and given to the poor.
# }

# # Matthew 25:10
# But when Jesus was aware of it,
# He said to them,
# {
#   Why do you trouble the woman?

#   For she has done a good work for Me.

#   # Matthew 25:11
#   For you have the poor with you always,
#   but Me you do not have always.

#   # Matthew 25:12
#   For in pouring this fragrant oil on My body,
#   she did it for My burial.

#   # Matthew 25:13
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   wherever this gospel is preached
#   in the whole world,
#   what this woman has done will also be told
#   as a memorial to her.
# }

# # Matthew 25:14
# Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot,
# went to the chief priests
# # Matthew 25:15
# and said,
# {
#   What are you willing to give me
#   if I deliver Him to you?
# }

# And they counted out to him
# thirty pieces of silver.

# # Matthew 25:16
# So from that time
# he sought opportunity to betray Him.

# # Matthew 25:17
# Now on the first day
# of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread
# the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him,
# {
#   Where do You want us to prepare for You
#   to eat the Passover?
# }

# # Matthew 25:18
# And He said,
# {
#   Go into the city to a certain man,
#   and say to him,
#   {
#     The Teacher says,
#     {
#       My time is at hand;
#       I will keep the Passover
#       at your house with My disciples.
#     }
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 25:19
# So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them;
# and they prepared the Passover.

# # Matthew 25:20
# When evening had come,
# He sat down with the twelve.

# # Matthew 25:21
# Now as they were eating, He said,
# {
#   Assuredly, I say to you,
#   one of you will betray Me.
# }

# # Matthew 25:22
# And they were exceedingly sorrowful,
# and each of them began to say to Him,
# {
#   Lord, is it I?
# }

# # Matthew 25:23
# He answered and said,
# {
#   He who dipped his hand with Me in the dish
#   will betray Me.

#   # Matthew 25:24
#   The Son of Man indeed goes
#   just as it is written of Him,
#   but woe to that man
#   by whom the Son of Man is betrayed!

#   It would have been good for that man
#   if he had not been born.
# }

# # Matthew 25:25
# Then Judas, who was betraying Him,
# answered and said,
# {
#   Rabbi, is it I?
# }

# He said to him,
# {
#   You have said it.
# }

# # Matthew 25:26
# And as they were eating, Jesus took bread,
# blessed and broke it,
# and gave it to the disciples and said,
# {
#   Take, eat; this is My body.
# }

# # Matthew 25:27
# Then He took the cup,
# and gave thanks,
# and gave it to them, saying,
# {
#   Drink from it, all of you.

#   # Matthew 25:28
#   For this is My blood of the new covenant,
#   which is shed for many
#   for the remission of sins.

#   # Matthew 25:29
#   But I say to you,
#   I will not drink of this fruit of the vine
#   from now on until that day
#   when I drink it new with you
#   in My Father's kingdom.
# }

# # Matthew 25:30
# And when they had sung a hymn,
# they went out to the Mount of Olives.

# # Matthew 25:31
# Then Jesus said to them,
# {
#   All of you will be made to stumble
#   because of Me
#   this night,
#   for it is written:
#   {
#     I will strike the Shepherd,
#     And the sheep of the flock
#       will be scattered.
#   }

#   # Matthew 25:32
#   But after I have been raised,
#   I will go before you to Galilee.
# }

# # Matthew 25:33
# Peter answered and said to Him,
# {
#   Even if all are made to stumble
#     because of You,
#   I will never be made to stumble.
# }

# # Matthew 25:34
# Jesus said to him,
# {
#   Assuredly, I say to you
#   that this night,
#   before the rooster crows,
#   you will deny Me three times.
# }

# # Matthew 25:35
# Peter said to Him,
# {
#   Even if I have to die with You,
#   I will not deny You!
# }

# And so said all the disciples.

# # Matthew 25:36
# Then Jesus came with them
# to a place called Gethsemane,
# and said to the disciples,
# {
#   Sit here while I go and pray over there.
# }

# # Matthew 25:37
# And He took with Him Peter
# and the two sons of Zebedee,
# and He began to be sorrowful
# and deeply distressed.

# # Matthew 25:38
# Then He said to them,
# {
#   My soul is exceedingly sorrowful,
#   even to death.

#   Stay here and watch with Me.
# }

# # Matthew 25:39
# He went a little farther and fell on His face,
# and prayed, saying,
# {
#   O My Father,
#   if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me;
#   nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.
# }

# # Matthew 25:40
# Then He came to the disciples
# and found them asleep,
# and said to Peter,
# {
#   What?

#   Could you not watch with Me one hour?

#   # Matthew 25:41
#   Watch and pray,
#   lest you enter into temptation.

#   The spirit indeed is willing,
#   but the flesh is weak.
# }

# # Matthew 25:42
# Again, a second time,
# He went away and prayed, saying,
# {
#   O My Father,
#   if this cup cannot pass away from Me
#   unless I drink it,
#   Your will be done.
# }

# # Matthew 25:43
# And He came and found them asleep again,
# for their eyes were heavy.

# # Matthew 25:44
# So He left them, went away again,
# and prayed the third time,
# saying the same words.

# # Matthew 25:45
# Then He came to His disciples and said to them,
# {
#   Are you still sleeping and resting?

#   Behold, the hour is at hand,
#   and the Son of Man is being betrayed
#   into the hands of sinners.

#   # Matthew 25:46
#   Rise, let us be going.

#   See, My betrayer is at hand.
# }

# # Matthew 25:47
# And while He was still speaking,
# behold, Judas, one of the twelve,
# with a great multitude with swords and clubs,
# came from the chief priests
# and elders of the people.

# # Matthew 25:48
# Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying,
# {
#   Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.
# }

# # Matthew 25:49
# Immediately he went up to Jesus and said,
# {
#   Greetings, Rabbi!
# }
# and kissed Him.

# # Matthew 25:50
# But Jesus said to him,
# {
#   Friend, why have you come?
# }

# Then they came
# and laid hands on Jesus
# and took Him.

# # Matthew 25:51
# And suddenly,
# one of those who were with Jesus
# stretched out his hand and drew his sword,
# struck the servant of the high priest,
# and cut off his ear.

# # Matthew 25:52
# But Jesus said to him,
# {
#   Put your sword in its place,
#   for all who take the sword
#   will perish by the sword.

#   # Matthew 25:53
#   Or do you think
#   that I cannot now pray to My Father,
#   and He will provide Me
#   with more than twelve legions of angels?

#   # Matthew 25:54
#   How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled,
#   that it must happen thus?
# }

# # Matthew 25:55
# In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes,
# {
#   Have you come out, as against a robber,
#   with swords and clubs to take Me?

#   I sat daily with you,
#   teaching in the temple,
#   and you did not seize Me.

#   # Matthew 25:56
#   But all this was done
#   that the Scriptures of the prophets
#   might be fulfilled.
# }

# Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.

# # Matthew 25:57
# And those who had laid hold of Jesus
# led Him away to Caiaphas the high priest,
# where the scribes and the elders were assembled.

# # Matthew 25:58
# But Peter followed Him at a distance
# to the high priest's courtyard.

# And he went in and sat with the servants
# to see the end.

# # Matthew 25:59
# Now the chief priests, the elders,
# and all the council
# sought false testimony against Jesus
# to put Him to death,
# # Matthew 25:60
# but found none.

# Even though many false witnesses came forward,
# they found none.

# But at last two false witnesses came forward
# # Matthew 25:61
# and said,
# {
#   This fellow said,
#   {
#     I am able to destroy the temple of God
#     and to build it in three days.
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 25:62
# And the high priest arose and said to Him,
# {
#   Do You answer nothing?

#   What is it these men testify against You?
# }

# # Matthew 25:63
# But Jesus kept silent.

# And the high priest answered and said to Him,
# {
#   I put You under oath by the living God:
#   Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!
# }

# # Matthew 25:64
# Jesus said to him,
# {
#   It is as you said.

#   Nevertheless, I say to you,
#   hereafter you will see the Son of Man
#   sitting at the right hand of the Power,
#   and coming on the clouds of heaven.
# }

# # Matthew 25:65
# Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying,
# {
#   He has spoken blasphemy!

#   What further need do we have of witnesses?

#   Look, now you have heard His blasphemy!

#   # Matthew 25:66
#   What do you think?
# }

# They answered and said,
# {
#   He is deserving of death.
# }

# # Matthew 25:67
# Then they spat in His face and beat Him;
# and others struck Him
# with the palms of their hands,
# # Matthew 25:68
# saying,
# {
#   Prophesy to us, Christ!

#   Who is the one who struck You?
# }

# # Matthew 25:69
# Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard.

# And a servant girl came to him, saying,
# {
#   You also were with Jesus of Galilee.
# }

# # Matthew 25:70
# But he denied it before them all, saying,
# {
#   I do not know what you are saying.
# }

# # Matthew 25:71
# And when he had gone out to the gateway,
# another girl saw him
# and said to those who were there,
# {
#   This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
# }

# # Matthew 25:72
# But again he denied with an oath,
# {
#   I do not know the Man!
# }

# # Matthew 25:73
# And a little later
# those who stood by came up and said to Peter,
# {
#   Surely you also are one of them,
#   for your speech betrays you.
# }

# # Matthew 25:74
# Then he began to curse and swear, saying,
# {
#   I do not know the Man!
# }

# Immediately a rooster crowed.

# # Matthew 25:75
# And Peter remembered the word of Jesus
# who had said to him,
# {
#   Before the rooster crows,
#   you will deny Me three times.
# }

# So he went out and wept bitterly.

# # Matthew 26:1
# When morning came,
# all the chief priests and elders of the people
# plotted against Jesus
# to put Him to death.

# # Matthew 26:2
# And when they had bound Him,
# they led Him away
# and delivered Him
# to Pontius Pilate the governor.

# # Matthew 26:3
# Then Judas, His betrayer,
# seeing that He had been condemned,
# was remorseful
# and brought back the 30 pieces of silver
# to the chief priests and elders,
# # Matthew 26:4
# saying,
# {
#   I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.
# }

# And they said,
# {
#   What is that to us?

#   You see to it!
# }

# # Matthew 26:5
# Then he threw down the pieces of silver
# in the temple
# and departed,
# and went and hanged himself.

# # Matthew 26:6
# But the chief priests took the silver pieces
# and said,
# {
#   It is not lawful
#   to put them into the treasury,
#   because they are the price of blood.
# }

# # Matthew 26:7
# And they consulted together
# and bought with them the potter's field,
# to bury strangers in.

# # Matthew 26:8
# Therefore
# that field has been called the Field of Blood
# to this day.

# # Matthew 26:9
# Then was fulfilled what was spoken
# by Jeremiah the prophet,
# saying,
# {
#   And they took the 30 pieces of silver,
#   the value of Him who was priced,
#   whom they of the children of Israel priced,
#   # Matthew 26:10
#   and gave them for the potter's field,
#   as the Lord directed me.
# }

# # Matthew 26:11
# Now Jesus stood before the governor.

# And the governor asked Him, saying,
# {
#   Are You the King of the Jews?
# }

# So Jesus said to him,
# {
#   It is as you say.
# }

# # Matthew 26:12
# And while He was being accused
# by the chief priests and elders,
# He answered nothing.

# # Matthew 26:13
# Then Pilate said to Him,
# {
#   Do You not hear how many things
#   they testify against You?
# }

# # Matthew 26:14
# But He answered him not one word,
# so that the governor marveled greatly.

# # Matthew 26:15
# Now at the feast
# the governor was accustomed
# to releasing to the multitude
# one prisoner whom they wished.

# # Matthew 26:16
# And at that time
# they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.

# # Matthew 26:17
# Therefore, when they had gathered together,
# Pilate said to them,
# {
#   Whom do you want me to release to you?

#   Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
# }

# # Matthew 26:18
# For he knew that they had handed Him over
# because of envy.

# # Matthew 26:19
# While he was sitting on the judgment seat,
# his wife sent to him, saying,
# {
#   Have nothing to do with that just Man,
#   for I have suffered many things today
#   in a dream
#   because of Him.
# }

# # Matthew 26:20
# But the chief priests and elders
# persuaded the multitudes
# that they should ask for Barabbas
# and destroy Jesus.

# # Matthew 26:21
# The governor answered and said to them,
# {
#   Which of the two
#   do you want me to release to you?
# }

# They said, "Barabbas!"

# # Matthew 26:22
# Pilate said to them,
# {
#   What then shall I do with Jesus
#   who is called Christ?
# }

# They all said to him,
# {
#   Let Him be crucified!
# }

# # Matthew 26:23
# Then the governor said,
# {
#   Why, what evil has He done?
# }

# But they cried out all the more, saying,
# {
#   Let Him be crucified!
# }

# # Matthew 26:24
# When Pilate saw
# that he could not prevail at all,
# but rather that a tumult was rising,
# he took water
# and washed his hands before the multitude,
# saying,
# {
#   I am innocent
#   of the blood
#   of this just Person.

#   You see to it.
# }

# # Matthew 26:25
# And all the people answered and said,
# {
#   His blood be on us and on our children.
# }

# # Matthew 26:26
# Then he released Barabbas to them;
# and when he had scourged Jesus,
# he delivered Him to be crucified.

# # Matthew 26:27
# Then the soldiers of the governor
# took Jesus into the Praetorium
# and gathered the whole garrison around Him.

# # Matthew 26:28
# And they stripped Him
# and put a scarlet robe on Him.

# # Matthew 26:29
# When they had twisted a crown of thorns,
# they put it on His head,
# and a reed in His right hand.

# And they bowed the knee before Him
# and mocked Him, saying,
# {
#   Hail, King of the Jews!
# }

# # Matthew 26:30
# Then they spat on Him,
# and took the reed and struck Him on the head.

# # Matthew 26:31
# And when they had mocked Him,
# they took the robe off Him,
# put His own clothes on Him,
# and led Him away to be crucified.

# # Matthew 26:32
# Now as they came out,
# they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name.

# Him they compelled to bear His cross.

# # Matthew 26:33
# And when they had come
# to a place called Golgotha,
# that is to say, Place of a Skull,
# # Matthew 26:34
# they gave Him sour wine
# mingled with gall to drink.

# But when He had tasted it,
# He would not drink.

# # Matthew 26:35
# Then they crucified Him,
# and divided His garments,
# casting lots,
# that it might be fulfilled
# which was spoken by the prophet:
# {
#   They divided My garments among them,
#   And for My clothing they cast lots.
# }

# # Matthew 26:36
# Sitting down, they kept watch over Him there.

# # Matthew 26:37
# And they put up over His head
# the accusation written against Him:

#   THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.

# # Matthew 26:38
# Then two robbers were crucified with Him,
# one on the right and another on the left.

# # Matthew 26:39
# And those who passed by blasphemed Him,
# wagging their heads
# # Matthew 26:40
# and saying,
# {
#   You who destroy the temple
#   and build it in three days,
#   save Yourself!

#   If You are the Son of God,
#   come down from the cross.
# }

# # Matthew 26:41
# Likewise the chief priests also,
# mocking with the scribes and elders, said,
# {
#   # Matthew 26:42
#   He saved others;
#   Himself He cannot save.

#   If He is the King of Israel,
#   let Him now come down from the cross,
#   and we will believe Him.

#   # Matthew 26:43
#   He trusted in God;
#   let Him deliver Him now if He will have Him;
#   for He said,
#   {
#     I am the Son of God.
#   }
# }

# # Matthew 26:44
# Even the robbers who were crucified with Him
# reviled Him with the same thing.

# # Matthew 26:45
# Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour
# there was darkness over all the land.

# # Matthew 26:46
# And about the ninth hour
# Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying,
# {
#   Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
# }
# that is,
# {
#   My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?
# }

# # Matthew 26:47
# Some of those who stood there,
# when they heard that, said,
# {
#   This Man is calling for Elijah!
# }

# # Matthew 26:48
# Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge,
# filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed,
# and offered it to Him to drink.

# # Matthew 26:49
# The rest said,
# {
#   Let Him alone;
#   let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.
# }

# # Matthew 26:50
# And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice,
# and yielded up His spirit.

# # Matthew 26:51
# Then, behold,
# the veil
# of the temple
# was torn in two
# from top to bottom;
# and the earth quaked,
# and the rocks were split,
# # Matthew 26:52
# and the graves were opened;
# and many bodies of the saints
# who had fallen asleep were raised;
# # Matthew 26:53
# and coming out of the graves after His resurrection,
# they went into the holy city and appeared to many.

# # Matthew 26:54
# So when the centurion and those with him,
# who were guarding Jesus,
# saw the earthquake
# and the things that had happened,
# they feared greatly, saying,
# {
#   Truly this was the Son of God!
# }

# # Matthew 26:55
# And many women who followed Jesus from Galilee,
# ministering to Him,
# were there looking on from afar,
# # Matthew 26:56
# among whom were Mary Magdalene,
# Mary the mother of James and Joses,
# and the mother of Zebedee's sons.

# # Matthew 26:57
# Now when evening had come,
# there came a rich man from Arimathea,
# named Joseph,
# who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.

# # Matthew 26:58
# This man went to Pilate
# and asked for the body of Jesus.

# Then Pilate commanded the body
# to be given to him.

# # Matthew 26:59
# When Joseph had taken the body,
# he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
# # Matthew 26:60
# and laid it in his new tomb
# which he had hewn out of the rock;
# and he rolled a large stone
# against the door of the tomb,
# and departed.

# # Matthew 26:61
# And Mary Magdalene was there,
# and the other Mary,
# sitting opposite the tomb.

# # Matthew 26:62
# On the next day,
# which followed the Day of Preparation,
# the chief priests and Pharisees
# gathered together to Pilate,
# # Matthew 26:63
# saying,
# {
#   Sir, we remember, while He was still alive,
#   how that deceiver said,
#   {
#     After three days I will rise.
#   }

#   # Matthew 26:64
#   Therefore command that the tomb be made secure
#   until the third day,
#   lest His disciples come by night
#   and steal Him away,
#   and say to the people,
#   {
#     He has risen from the dead.
#   }

#   So the last deception
#   will be worse than the first.
# }

# # Matthew 26:65
# Pilate said to them,
# {
#   You have a guard;
#   go your way,
#   make it as secure as you know how.
# }

# # Matthew 26:66
# So they went and made the tomb secure,
# sealing the stone and setting the guard.

# # Matthew 27:1
# Now after the Sabbath,
# as the first day of the week began to dawn,
# Mary Magdalene and the other Mary
# came to see the tomb.

# # Matthew 27:2
# And behold, there was a great earthquake;
# for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven,
# and came and rolled back the stone from the door,
# and sat on it.

# # Matthew 27:3
# His countenance was like lightning,
# and his clothing as white as snow.

# # Matthew 27:4
# And the guards shook for fear of him,
# and became like dead men.

# # Matthew 27:5
# But the angel answered and said to the women,
# {
#   Do not be afraid,
#   for I know
#   that you seek Jesus who was crucified.

#   # Matthew 27:6
#   He is not here;
#   for He is risen,
#   as He said.

#   Come, see the place where the Lord lay.

#   # Matthew 27:7
#   And go quickly and tell His disciples
#   that He is risen from the dead,
#   and indeed He is going before you
#   into Galilee;
#   there you will see Him.

#   Behold, I have told you.
# }

# # Matthew 27:8
# So they went out quickly from the tomb
# with fear and great joy,
# and ran to bring His disciples word.

# # Matthew 27:9
# And as they went to tell His disciples,
# behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"

# So they came and held Him by the feet
# and worshiped Him.

# # Matthew 27:10
# Then Jesus said to them,
# {
#   Do not be afraid.

#   Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee,
#   and there they will see Me.
# }

# # Matthew 27:11
# Now while they were going,
# behold, some of the guard came into the city
# and reported to the chief priests
# all the things that had happened.

# # Matthew 27:12
# When they had assembled with the elders
# and consulted together,
# they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
# # Matthew 27:13
# saying,
# {
#   Tell them,
#   {
#     His disciples came at night
#     and stole Him away while we slept.
#   }

#   # Matthew 27:14
#   And if this comes to the governor's ears,
#   we will appease him and make you secure.
# }

# # Matthew 27:15
# So they took the money
# and did as they were instructed;
# and this saying is commonly reported
# among the Jews until this day.

# # Matthew 27:16
# Then the eleven disciples
# went away into Galilee,
# to the mountain
# which Jesus had appointed for them.

# # Matthew 27:17
# When they saw Him, they worshiped Him;
# but some doubted.

# # Matthew 27:18..19
# And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying,
# {
#   All authority has been given to Me
#   in heaven and on earth.

#   Go therefore
#   and make disciples of all the nations,
#   baptizing them in the name
#   of the Father
#   and of the Son
#   and of the Holy Spirit,
#   teaching them to observe all things
#   that I have commanded you;
#   and lo, I am with you always,
#   even to the end of the age.
# }

# Amen.
