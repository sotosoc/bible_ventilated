י֔וֹם (yom)
------------------------------------------------------------

(yom) is a Hebrew noun which means "day". It is used
throughout the Hebrew Bible to refer to a 24-hour period,
the daylight portion of a day, or a more general period of
time.

In the context of Genesis 1, the word is used to refer to
the six days of creation, during which God created the
heavens and the earth and all that is in them. The seventh
day is also referred to as "י֔וֹם" and is the day of rest that
God sanctified after completing his work of creation.

The word "י֔וֹם" is spelled with the Hebrew letters yod (י),
vav (ו), and mem (ם), and is pronounced "yom". It is
commonly used in modern Hebrew to refer to a day, just as it
is used in the Bible.
