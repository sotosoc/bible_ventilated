V-Nifal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V-Nifal is a verb conjugation that represents a passive voice.

It is one of the seven binyanim or "building blocks" used to form verb
conjugations in Hebrew.

The letter "Nun" in V-Nifal is the third letter of the root, and its vowel
pattern changes depending on the tense and person.

The V-Nifal is used to describe an action that is done to the subject of the
sentence or the recipient of the action.

  In other words, the subject of the sentence is the one who receives or
  undergoes the action, rather than the one who performs it.

  The passive voice is often used in Hebrew to emphasize the action or its
  result, rather than the agent or the doer of the action.

Examples of V-Nifal verbs in Hebrew include "to be built" (נִבְנֶה, nivneh), "to be
heard" (נִשְׁמַע, nishma), and "to be seen" (נִרְאֶה, nir'eh).

In each of these examples, the subject of the sentence is the one that is being
acted upon or undergoing the action.
